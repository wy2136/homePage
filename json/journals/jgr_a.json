        "description": "\n\nAtmospheric gravity wave activities in the mesopause region have been observed and statistically investigated with a sodium lidar chain in eastern China. In total, there were 471 gravity waves identified from over 5,400 hours of observations at Hainan (19.99\u00b0N, 110.34\u00b0E), Hefei (31.87\u00b0N, 117.23\u00b0E), and Beijing (40.47\u00b0N, 115.97\u00b0E). These waves typically had vertical wavelengths of \u03bbz\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2212\u20094 km, observed periods of Tob\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u2212\u20094 hr, amplitude growth factors of \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.025\u2009~\u2009+\u20090.05 km\u22121, and wave amplitudes of Ae\u03b2\u2009\u00b5\u200990km\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009\u2212\u20096\u2009%. Strong systematic parameter relationships were found, and they agree with the predictions of diffusive filtering theory. Statistical results show that the seasonal variability of gravity wave activity had a summer-maximum and winter-minimum characteristic in the mesopause region over eastern China. A qualitative interpretation is proposed regarding the seasonal and geographic variability observed by the lidar chain, based on analysis of source properties and influences from background wind, which vary by season.\n",

The processes maintaining these maxima are not well understood. We analyze the variability of water vapor in the monsoon regions based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations during 2005\u20132013, and quantify links to deep convection, large-scale temperatures and monsoonal circulations. Strong sub-seasonal variations in stratospheric water vapor are closely linked with deep convection in the monsoon regions, with the surprising result that stronger convection leads to a relatively dry stratosphere and weaker convection to a wetter stratosphere. This result is observed for both the Asian and NA monsoon regions. This behavior is explained by temperature changes in the stratosphere tied to deep convection: stronger convection leads to relatively cold temperatures in the subtropical lower stratosphere, which is the key region controlling large-scale dehydration within the anticyclonic monsoonal circulations. Likewise, weaker convection leads to warmer subtropical stratospheric temperatures, relatively less dehydration and enhanced water vapor. The observed water vapor changes are in approximate agreement with those expected from the subtropical temperature variations, taking into account dilution of the dehydrated air into the larger monsoon region. These results demonstrate that stratospheric water vapor in the NH monsoon regions is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation and temperatures, and overshooting deep convection plays a relatively minor role.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn this study, the characteristics of the Arctic Mixed-phase Cloud (AMC) have been investigated using data collected at the ARM NSA site from October 2006 to September 2009. AMC has an annual occurrence frequency of 42.3%, which includes 18.7% of single-layered AMCs and 23.6% for multiple layers. Two cloud-base heights (CBHs) are defined from ceilometer and micropulse lidar (MPL) measurements. For single-layered AMC, the ceilometer-derived CBH represents the base of the liquid-dominant layer near the cloud top, while MPL-derived CBH represents base of the lower ice-dominant layer. The annual mean CBHs from ceilometer and MPL measurements are 1.0 km and 0.6 km, respectively, with the largest difference (~1.0 km) occurring from December to March and the smallest difference in September. The humidity inversion occurrence decreases with increasing humidity inversion intensity (stronger in summer than in winter). During the winter months, AMC occurrences increase from 15% to 35% when the inversion intensity increases from 0.1 to 0.9 g/kg. On the contrary, despite a higher frequency of strong humidity inversion in summer, AMC occurrences are nearly invariant for different inversion intensities. On average, humidity and temperature inversion frequencies of occurrence above an AMC are five and eight times, respectively, as high as those below an AMC. The strong inversion occurrences for both humidity and temperature above an AMC provide the moisture sources from above for the formation and maintenance of AMCs. This result helps to reconcile the persistency of AMCs even when the Arctic surface is covered by snow and ice.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn this paper, we analyze the electric field at ground level during the first stage of triggered lightning experiments, i.e. during the rocket ascent and prior to the lightning initiation. At distances of some tens of meters from the triggering wire, the electric field decreases significantly, while at distances of several hundred meters, there is only a very small decrease of the electric field. Two effects determine the level of the electric field reduction: the corona layer at ground level and the corona sheath around the triggering wire.\nWe present an analytical solution based on the charge simulation method to study the phenomenon. The model is validated by comparing its results to those obtained by numerical simulations using the finite element method. A ground space charge layer and a corona sheath around the rocket-triggered lightning wire are included in the simulation. It is shown that, depending on the charge distribution, the change of the sign of the electric field is correctly predicted by our model. The obtained reductions of the electric field are consistent with simulations and experiments presented in the literature. Moreover, the proposed analytical solution is faster and it allows studying the influence of several parameters simultaneously, i.e. the radius of the corona sheath and the space charge layer parameters. The described analytical model allows the estimation of the corona sheath radius if the parameters of the space charge layer are known from experiment.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn a changing climate, the impact of tropical cyclones on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts will be affected both by how intense and how frequent these storms become. The observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin is too short (AD 1851-present) to allow for accurate assessment of low-frequency variability in storm activity. In order to overcome the limitations of the short observational record, we downscale four CMIP5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic basin that span the interval AD 850 \u2013 2005. Using these long-term synthetic tropical cyclone data sets, we investigate the relationship between power dissipation and ocean temperature metrics, as well as the relationship between basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone count statistics over the past millennium. Contrary to previous studies, we find only a very weak relationship between power dissipation and main development region sea surface temperature in the Atlantic basin. Consistent with previous studies, we find that basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone counts are significantly correlated with one another, lending further support for the use of paleohurricane landfall records to infer long-term basin-wide tropical cyclone trends.\n",

        "description": "\n\nHigh resolution 3-dimensional simulations are presented of the interactions between turbulent shear flows moving with mean relative velocity \u2206U below a stably stratified region with buoyancy frequency (N+). An artificial forcing in the simulation, with a similar effect as a small negative eddy viscosity, leads to a steady state flow which models thin interfaces. Characteristic eddies of the turbulence have length scale L. If the bulk Richardson number Rib=(LN+/\u2206U)2 lies between lower and upper critical values denoted as Ri*(<1/5) and \nR\u02dci\u223c1, a \u2019detached\u2019 layer is formed in the stable region with thickness L+ greater than L, in which rotational fluctuations and inhomogeneous turbulence are induced above an interface with large gradients of density/temperature. Comparisons are made with shear turbulent interfaces with no stratification. When \nRib>R\u02dci, vertical propagating waves are generated, with shear stresses carrying significant momentum flux, and progressively less as Rib increases. Simulations for a jet and a turbulent mixing layer show similar results. A perturbation analysis, using inhomogeneous Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT), models the transition zone between shear eddies below the interface and the fluctuations in the stratified region, consistent with the simulations. It demonstrates how the wave-momentum-flux has a maximum when Rib~2, and then decreases as Rib increases. This coupling mechanism between eddies and waves which is neglected in eddy viscosity models for shear layers, can drive flows in the stratosphere and the deeper ocean, with significant consequences for short and long term flow phenomena. The \u2019detached layer\u2019 is a mechanism that contributes to the formation of stratus clouds and polluted layers above the atmospheric boundary layer.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA new approach to parameterizing the modulation of aerosol scavenging by electric charges on particles and droplets gives improved accuracy, and is applied over an extended range of droplet and particle radii relevant to cloud microphysical processes. The base level scavenging rates for small particles are dominated by diffusion, and for large particles by intercept, weight, and flow effects. For charged particles encountering uncharged droplets, in all cases there is an increase in the scavenging rates, due to the image force. For droplets with charges of opposite sign to those of the particle charge, the rates are further increased, due to the Coulomb force, whereas for droplet with charges of the same sign, the rates are decreased. Increases above the base level (electro-scavenging) predominate for the larger particles, and occur in the interior of clouds even when no space charge (net charge) is present. Decreases below the base level (electro-anti-scavenging) occur for same-sign charges with smaller particles. The rates for uncharged droplets are parameterized, and the effect of charges on the droplets then parameterized as a departure from those rates. The results are convenient for incorporation in models of clouds which include detailed microphysics, to model the electrically-induced reductions and increases in CCN and IFN concentrations and size distributions and contact ice nucleation rates that affect coagulation and precipitation and cloud albedo. Implications for effects on weather and climate, due both to externally and internally induced variability in atmospheric ionization, are outlined.",

The DB C6 retrievals have 34\u201339% less uncertainties, 2\u20133 times smaller root mean square error (RMSE), and 3\u20134 times smaller mean absolute error (MAE) than DB C5 retrievals. The DT C6 has 4\u20138% lower bias, 4\u201312% less overestimation, and smaller RMSE and MAE errors than DT C5. Due to underestimation of surface reflectance and the use of inappropriate aerosol schemes, 87\u201389% of the collocations of the DT C6 at 3 km fall above the expected error (EE), with overestimation of 64\u201379% which is 15\u201327% higher than for the DT C6 at 10 km.

        "description": "\n\nThe high resolution (375 m) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite allows retrieving relatively accurately the vertical evolution of convective cloud drop effective radius (re) with height or temperature. A tight relationship is found over SE Asia and the adjacent seas during summer between the cloud-free aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the cloud thickness required for the initiation of warm rain, as represented by the satellite retrieved cloud droplet re of 14 \u00b5m, for a subset of conditions that minimize measurement artifacts. This cloud depth (\u0394T14) is parameterized as the difference between the cloud base temperature and the temperature at the height where re exceeds 14 \u00b5m (T14). For a unit increase of AOD, the height of rain initiation is increased by about 5.5 km. The concern of data artifacts due to the increase in AOD near clouds was mitigated by selecting only scenes with cloud fraction (CF) < 0.1. For CF > 0.1 and \u0394T14 > ~20\u00b0C, the increase of \u0394T14 gradually levels off with further increase of AOD, possibly because the AOD is enhanced by aerosol upward transport and detrainment through the clouds below the T14 isotherm. The bias in the retrieved re due to the different geometries of solar illumination was also quantified. It was shown that the retrievals are valid only for backscatter views, or when avoiding scenes with significant amount of cloud self-shadowing. These artifacts might have contributed to past reported relationships between cloud properties and AOD.",

The calculated CBL height sequence displays the regular diurnal cycle of the CBL top. The prevalent mixing process within the CBL is also revealed. During the CBL growth period, the backscatter ratio R falls visibly with increasing altitude and has large variance within the CBL, suggesting that more abundant aerosol particles from lower altitudes are being transported upward and being mixed with the local background or advected aerosol layers. During the CBL quasi-stationary period, R tends to be vertically uniform and its variance reaches a daytime minimum within the CBL, indicating that the vertical homogenization of aerosol particles produced by the convectively-driven mixing reaches its maximum. During the afternoon and early evening transition period, the vertical uniformity of R weakens and the variance enlarges again, implying that the reduced convectively-driven mixing fails to maintain a high vertical homogeneity. When the 1-min R profiles were plotted together in terms of each 1-hour interval, the fluctuating R curves at heights around the CBL top looked like a \u201cnode\u201d, representing the structure of the entrainment zone between the CBL and the free troposphere. The moving \u201cnode\u201d depicts the evolution of the entrainment zone. The diurnal variation of the CBL height shows an obvious seasonal dependence which coincides with the annual variation of the local surface temperature. The surface fine particle concentration generally has a more complex diurnal cycle than that expected from the CBL-dilution/accumulation effect. But, it shows a strong annual variation which is out of phase with respect to that of the monthly-mean maximum CBL height. This tends to suggest that the seasonal behavior of the surface fine particle concentration mainly depends on the seasonal variation in available volume (determined by the CBL height) for aerosol dispersion.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSocioeconomic drought broadly refers to conditions whereby the water supply cannot satisfy the demand. Most previous studies describe droughts based on large scale meteorological/hydrologic conditions, ignoring the demand and local resilience to cope with climate variability. Reservoirs provide resilience against climatic extremes and play a key role in water supply and demand management. Here, we outline a unique multivariate approach as a measure of socioeconomic drought, termed Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI). The model combines information on the inflow and reservoir storage relative to the demand. MSRRI combines: (I) a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach that focuses on processes/phenomena that cannot be simply controlled or altered by decision makers, such as climate change and variability, and (II) a \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology that represents the local resilience and societal capacity to respond or adapt to droughts. MSRRI is based on a nonparametric multivariate distribution function that links Inflow-Demand Reliability (IDR) indicator to Water Storage Resilience (WSR) indicator. These indicators are used to assess socioeconomic drought during the Australian Millennium Drought (1998\u20132010) and the 2011\u20132014 California Drought. The results show that MSRRI is superior to univariate indices because it captures both early onset and persistence of water stress over time. The suggested framework can be applied to both individual reservoirs and a group of reservoirs in a region, and it is consistent with the currently available standardized drought indicators. MSRRI provides complementary information on socioeconomic drought development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand that cannot be achieved from the commonly used drought indicators.",

The model reproduces the observed seasonality of surface BC fairly well over most parts of India but fails to capture the seasonality in the Himalayas and deviates from the observed BC magnitude at several sites. The errors in modeled BC are attributed to uncertainties in BC emissions and their diurnal cycle, planetary boundary layer height underestimation and aerosol processes. Model results show distinct but opposite seasonality of BC in the lower (LT) and free troposphere (FT) with BC showing winter maximum and summer minimum in the LT and vice-versa in the FT. Our analysis shows that BC seasonality is not driven by seasonality of the anthropogenic emissions but by changes in the regional meteorology through weakening of the horizontal transport and strengthening of the vertical transport of BC during summertime compared to winter. BC in both the LT and FT comes mostly from anthropogenic emissions followed by biomass burning emissions except during winter when long-distant sources become more important in the FT. BC in the FT is significantly affected by anthropogenic emissions from all parts of India. The source-receptor relationship changes seasonally but the regional transport remains a significant contributor to BC loadings in the LT of India highlighting the necessity of considering non-local sources along with local emissions when designing strategies for mitigating BC impacts on air quality.",

Based on comparison with AE estimates calculated using the Budyko equation, all five reanalysis datasets reasonably reproduce the spatial patterns of AE over China, with a clearly southeast-northwest gradient. Overall, JRA-55 (NCEP-DOE) gives the lowest (highest) reanalysis evaporation (RE) values. From 1979 to 2013, dominant modes of RE among five reanalyses are extracted using multivariate empirical orthogonal function analysis (MV-EOF). Accordingly, the interdecadal variation of RE is likely driven by the change of temperature and the interannual variation is constrained by the water supply conditions. Under climate warming RE increase in the Northwest China, Yangtze-Huaihe river basin, and South China, while decrease in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, northern and Northeast China. Moreover, the relationship between RE and pan evaporation (PE) are comprehensively evaluated in space-time. Negative correlations are generally confirmed in non-humid environments, while positive correlations exist in the humid regions. Our analysis supports the interpretation that the relationship between PE and AE was complementary with water control and proportional with energy control. In view of data availability, important differences in spatial variability and the amount of RE can be found in Northwest China, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the Yangtze River Basin. Generally speaking, NCEP-NCAR and MERRA have substantial problems on describing the long-term change of RE, however, there are some inaccuracies in the JRA-55 estimates when focus on the year-to-year variation.",

        "description": "\n\nInternal variability (IV) in dynamical downscaling with limited-area models (LAM) represents a source of error inherent to the downscaled fields, which originates from the sensitive dependence of the models to arbitrarily small modifications. If IV is large it may impose the need for probabilistic verification of the downscaled information. Atmospheric spectral nudging (ASN) can reduce IV in LAMs as it constrains the large-scale components of LAM fields in the interior of the computational domain and thus prevents any considerable penetration of sensitively dependent deviations into the range of large scales. Using initial condition ensembles, the present study quantifies the impact of ASN on IV in LAM simulations in the range of fine scales that are not controlled by spectral nudging. Four simulation configurations that all include strong ASN but differ in the nudging settings are considered. In the fifth configuration, grid nudging of land surface variables towards high-resolution surface analyses is applied. The results show that the IV at scales larger than 300 km can be suppressed by selecting an appropriate ASN setup. At scales between 300 and 30 km, however, in all configurations, the hourly near-surface temperature, humidity and winds are only partly reproducible. Nudging the land surface variables is found to have the potential to significantly reduce IV, particularly for fine-scale temperature and humidity. On the other hand, hourly precipitation accumulations at these scales are generally irreproducible in all configurations and probabilistic approach to downscaling is therefore recommended.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis paper uses a state-of-the-art general circulation model to study the impacts of the stratospheric ozone depletion from 1980-2000 and the expected partial ozone recovery from 2000-2020 on the propagation of planetary waves in December, January and February. In the southern hemisphere (SH), the stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a cooler and stronger Antarctic stratosphere, while the stratospheric ozone recovery has the opposite effects. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the impacts of the stratospheric ozone depletion on polar stratospheric temperature are not opposite to that of the stratospheric ozone recovery, i.e., the stratospheric ozone depletion causes a weak cooling and the stratospheric ozone recovery causes a statistically significant cooling. The stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a weakening of the Arctic polar vortex while the stratospheric ozone recovery leads to a strengthening of the Arctic polar vortex. The cooling of the Arctic polar vortex is found to be dynamically induced via modulating the planetary wave activity by stratospheric ozone increases. Particularly interesting is that stratospheric ozone changes have opposite effects on the stationary and transient wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere. The analysis of the wave refractive index and Eliassen\u2013Palm flux in the NH indicate (1) that the wave refraction in the stratosphere cannot fully explain wave flux changes in the Arctic stratosphere, and (2) that stratospheric ozone changes can cause changes in wave propagation in the northern mid-latitude troposphere which in turn affect wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere.\nIn the SH, the radiative cooling (warming) caused by stratospheric ozone depletion (recovery) produces a larger (smaller) meridional temperature gradient in the mid-latitudes upper troposphere, accompanied by larger (smaller) zonal wind vertical shear and larger (smaller) vertical gradients of buoyancy frequency. Hence, there are more (fewer) transient waves propagating into the stratosphere. The dynamical warming (cooling) caused by stratospheric ozone decreases (increases) partly offsets their radiative cooling (warming).\n",

Further, the atmospheric implications of dust coatings on ice-cloud properties under different assumptions of primary ice nucleation mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the ice nucleation ability of Arizona Test Dust, illite, K-feldspar and quartz as a function of temperature (-25 to -30\u00b0C) and relative humidity with respect to water (75 to 110%). The particles (bare or nitric acid coated) were size selected at 250 nm, and the fraction of particles nucleating ice at various temperature and saturation conditions was determined. All of the dust species nucleated ice at subsaturated conditions, although the coated particles (except quartz) showed a reduction in their ice nucleation ability relative to bare particles. However, at supersaturated conditions, bare and coated particles had nearly equivalent ice nucleation characteristics. The results of a single-column model showed that simulated ice crystal number concentrations are mostly dependent upon the coated particle fraction, primary ice nucleation mechanisms, and competition among ice nucleation mechanisms to nucleate ice. In general, coatings were observed to modify ice-cloud properties, and the complexity of ice-cloud and mixed-phase-cloud evolution when different primary ice nucleation mechanisms compete for fixed water vapor budgets was supported.\n",

These local circulations are defined through a decomposition of the vertical mass flux into its zonal and meridional components. Defining the local circulation this way ensures that the two orthogonal circulations (the local Hadley and Walker circulations) sum to the original circulation even after averaging the circulations regionally. Large regional differences in changes in the local Hadley and Walker circulations over a 31-year period are found. For example, the local Hadley circulation has shifted southward over Africa, the Maritime Continent as well as the western and central Pacific by about one degree. Over the Americas and the Atlantic the local Hadley circulation has strengthened by about 1-5%. The zonal component of the vertical mass flux has increased by about 10-20% in the tropics over all continents and decreased over the adjacent oceans by about 10-20%. Although the local Walker circulations in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic have weakened, the circulation in the Pacific has changed little (about 1-2%). The local Walker circulations in all ocean basins have shifted westwards by about 1-2\u00b0 on average.\n",

This instrument has a high spectral resolution (0.0625 cm\u22121) and a wide spectral coverage (from 685 to 2410 cm\u22121) that allow measuring and discriminating among the many bands originating the atmospheric 4.3 \u03bcm radiance. Also its high sensitivity allows measuring the atmospheric limb emission in a wide altitude range, from 20 to 170 km in its middle and upper atmosphere modes, and hence obtain information on the temperature dependence of the collisional rates. In particular, we retrieve the rate coefficients and their temperature dependence in the 130\u2013250 K range of the following processes: CO2(vd,v3)+N2 \u21cc CO2(vd,v3\u20131)+N2(1) with vd=2v1+v2=2, 3 and 4; CO2(v1,v2,l,l,r)+M \u21cc CO2\nv1\u2032v2\u2032l\u20321r\u2032+M with \u2206vd = \nvd\u2032\u2212vd = 0 and \u2206l=0; and with \u2206vd=0 and \u2206l\u22600. In addition we have also retrieved the thermal relaxation of CO2(v3) intothe v1 and v2 modes, e.g., CO2(vd,v3) + M \u21cc CO2(v\nvd\u2032,v3\u20131) + M with \u2206vd=2-4 and \u2206v3=\u22121; and the efficiency of the excitation of N2(1) by O(1D. All of them were retrieved with amuch better accuracy than were known before. The new rates have very important effects on the atmospheric limb radiance in the 10, 4.3 and 2.7 \u03bcm spectral regions (5-8% at 4.3 \u03bcm) and allow a more accurate inversion of the CO2 volume mixing ratio in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere from measurements taken in those spectral regions.\n",

The NBPs had typical average parameters: 10-90% rise time of 2.6 \u03bcs, full width at half maximum time of 2.8 \u03bcs, zero cross time of 9.9 \u03bcs, and range normalized amplitude at 100 km of 11.0 V/m. Four main types of positive NBP waveforms were identified: Type A had a simple bipolar waveform with a positive peak and a negative overshoot peak (1% of NBPs), Type B had extra peak(s) superimposed on the overshoot peak (67%), Type C had extra peak(s) on or just after the main positive peak (13%), and Type D had extra peak(s) before the main positive peak (19%). Regardless of type, each NBP waveform maintained its basic shape across a range of 10 to 130 km from its origin. NBP locations, obtained with a time of arrival technique, seemed unrestricted in their horizontal distribution (except for Type C), while NBP altitudes ranged from 7 to 19 km with an average of 13 km. Estimated peak currents were 2\u2013126 kA with an average of 30 kA. Isolation of NBPs from other lightning events was determined for both temporal (660 ms) and spatial (>10 km) quantities; 37% of NBPs were isolated, 38% occurred within 660 ms before a flash, 19% occurred within flashes, and 11% occurred within 660 ms after a flash.

The models simulate periods with in-phase seasonal precipitation anomalies but the strength of this relationship is variable on multi-decadal timescales, behavior that is also exhibited by the reconstructions. The models, however, are unable to simulate periods with consistently out-of-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies as observed in the latter part of the instrumental interval. The periods with predominantly in-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies in the models are significant against randomness, and while this result is suggestive of a potential for dual-season drought on interannual and longer timescales, models do not consistently exhibit the persistent dual-season drought seen in the dendroclimatic reconstructions. These collective findings indicate that model-derived drought risk assessments may underestimate the potential for dual-season drought in 21st-century projections of hydroclimate in the American Southwest and parts of Mexico.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe impact of mesoscale structures on the occurrence of anomalous propagation (AP) conditions for radio waves, including ducts, super refractive and subrefractive conditions were studied. The chosen meteorological situations are the bora wind and the sporadic sea/land breeze (SB/LB) during three selected cases over a large portion of the northern Adriatic. For this purpose, we used available radiosoundings and numerical mesoscale model simulations (of real cases and their sensitivity tests) at a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km and 81 vertical levels. The model simulated the occurrences of AP conditions satisfactorily, although their intensities and frequency were underestimated at times. Certain difficulties appeared in reproducing the vertical profile of the modified refractive index, which is mainly dependent on the accuracy of the modeled humidity. The spatial distributions of summer AP conditions reveal that the surface layer above the sea (roughly between 30 and 100 m asl) is often covered by super refractive conditions and ducts. The SB is highly associated with the formations of AP conditions: (i) in the first 100 m asl, where trapping and super refractive conditions form because of the advection of cold and moist air, and (ii) inside the transition layer between the SB body and the elevated return flow in the form of subrefractive conditions. When deep convection occurs, all three types of AP conditions are caused by the downdraft beneath the cumulonimbus cloud base in its mature phase that creates smaller but marked pools of cold and dry air. The bora wind usually creates a pattern of AP conditions associated with the hydraulic jump and influences distribution of AP conditions over the sea surface.\n",

Due to this complexity, process-based models are often preferred to estimate the net magnitude and directionality of interactions in the Earth system. However, these models are based on simpli_cations of our understanding of nature, thus are unavoidably imperfect. Conversely, observation-based data of climatic and environmental variables are becoming increasingly accessible over global scales due to the progress of space-borne sensing technologies and data-assimilation techniques. Albeit uncertain, these data enable the possibility to start unraveling complex multivariable, multiscale relationships if the appropriate statistical methods are applied. Here, we investigate the potential of the wavelet cross-correlation method as a tool for identifying time/frequency-dependent interactions, feedback and regime shifts in geophysical systems. The ability of wavelet cross-correlation to resolve the fast and slow components of coupled systems is tested on synthetic data of known directionality, and then applied to observations to study one of the most critical interactions between land and atmosphere: the coupling between soil moisture and near-ground air temperature. Results show that our method is able to capture the dynamics of the soil moisture-temperature coupling over a wide range of temporal scales (from days to several months) and climatic regimes (from wet to dry), and consistently identify the magnitude and directionality of the coupling. Consequently, wavelet cross-correlations are presented as a promising tool for the study of multiscale interactions, with the potential of being extended to the analysis of causal relationships in the Earth system\n",

Here we make use of ten years of snow pit and short core \u03b418O data and hourly snow-height measurements obtained by an automated weather station deployed at the ice cap's summit to analyze linkages between snowfall, \u03b418O and the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). Snow accumulation peaks in December and is negative May-September. Snow \u03b418O values decrease gradually through austral summer from about -17 to -24 per mil. Surface snow \u03b418O is altered after deposition during austral winter from about -24 to -15 per mil. More than 70% of the total snow accumulation is tied to convection along the leading edge of cold air incursions of mid-latitude air advected equatorward from southern South America. Snowfall amplitude at Quelccaya Ice Cap varies systematically with regional precipitation, atmospheric dynamics, mid-troposphere humidity, and water vapor \u03b4D. Strongest snowfall gains correspond with positive precipitation anomalies over the western Amazon Basin, increased humidity and lowered water vapor \u03b4D values, consistent with the \u2018amount effect\u2019. We discuss ventilation of the monsoon, modulated by mid-latitude cold air advection, as potentially diagnostic of the relationship between SASM dynamics and Quelccaya snowfall. Results will serve as a basis for development of a comprehensive isotopic forward model to reconstruct past monsoon dynamics using the ice core \u03b418O record.\n",

It is one of the most uncertain variables, especially in this \u201cnew Arctic\u201d climate system, which is dominated by large ice-free ocean areas for a longer portion of the year. Moisture flux rates, produced using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data, from the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas were found to have increased between 2003-2013 by 7.2x10-4 g m-2s-1 per year (equivalent to 1.79 W m-2 per year in latent heat). This is a 7% increase in the average moisture flux each year and a 0.12% increase in the yearly global ocean latent heat flux, with some months increasing more than others. The largest increases seen are in the Arctic coastal seas during the spring and fall where there has been a reduction in sea ice cover, and an increase in sea surface temperatures. Increases in the moisture flux from the surface also correspond to increases in total atmospheric column water vapor and low-level clouds, especially in the central Arctic regions. Changes in the atmospheric water vapor in the surrounding seas (e.g. East Greenland) are most likely due to lower-latitude transport of moisture rather than from the surface. Yearly, the moisture flux from the surface supplies about 10% of the total column atmosphere water vapor.\n",

ISUAL is an instrument composed of an imager and a multichannel spectrophotometer which is able to measure the brightness from Far-Ultra Violet to Near-Infrared for TLEs and lightning flashes. Several types of TLEs have been identified, classified and documented between 2004 and 2014. However, no statistical analyses on lightning have already been realized. In this paper, we focus on lightning flashes which did not induce TLEs. Statistics about brightness or temporal dynamic are presented from fitted waveforms from Far-Ultra Violet to Near-Infrared, after having corrected for atmospheric effects for each spectrophotometer channels. We demonstrate that the lightning/satellite distance and the altitude of the lightning need to be taken into account. The lightning waveforms from each spectrophotometer channel could be modeled as an exponential pulsed function which the shape could be explained by the photon propagation in the cloud. The median values at 777.4 nm are 1.63\u00d710-6 W.m-2 for the maximum brightness, 5.85\u00d7104 J for the total energy at the source, 414 \u00b5s for the FWHM, 620 \u00b5s for the FWQM and 170 \u00b5s for the rise time.

The Hexi Corridor, which is a typical arid and semi-arid region in Northwest China, was selected as the study area. Streamflows were simulated by an integrated water system model in historical period (1985\u20132005) and three future periods (2030s, 2050s and 2070s). Twenty-nine Global Climate Models were picked from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) based on projection performance, and the high (RCP85) and intermediate (RCP45) ranges of Representative Concentration Pathways were selected for future scenario analysis. All the streamflow were characterized in detail by flow regime metrics, including the magnitude, variability and frequency of the overall flow events. The regional impacts of climate change were assessed and clustered into several similar spatial patterns. Results showed that the projected climate change would sensibly increase the magnitudes of average and low flows (<75th percentile), as well as the frequencies of low and high flows (>25th percentile), but decrease the flow variability. By contrast, it would not sensibly change the magnitude of high flow events. The flow regime variations of all scenarios and periods were clustered into three robust classes (highly, moderately, and slightly impacted classes) in the entire region. The flow regimes would be highly and moderately impacted in the middle and down streams with large-sized and semi-desert catchments, but slightly impacted in the upper and middle streams with small-sized and montane vegetation catchments. The impacted classes will sensibly vary at most stations in different future periods because of the spatial differences of climate change.

This work uses space-borne observations made with the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) instrument on the Odin satellite to retrieve the near-global K layer for the first time. The satellite data (2004 to mid-2013) is used to validate the implementation of a recently proposed chemistry scheme in a whole atmosphere chemistry climate model, which provides a chemical basis for this semi-annual seasonal behavior. The satellite and model data show that this semi-annual seasonality is near-global in extent, with the strongest variation at mid- and high latitudes. The column abundance, centroid layer height and RMS-width of the K layer are consistent with the limited available lidar record. The K dataset is then used to investigate the impact of polar mesospheric clouds on the metal layers at high latitudes during summer. Finally, the occurrence frequency of sporadic K layers and their possible link to sporadic E layers is examined.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Imager of Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) on the FORMOSAT-2 satellite, launched in 2004, records Transient Luminous Events (TLEs). ISUAL has an imager and a spectrophotometer that observe TLEs all over the globe. Among these phenomena, elves are particularly difficult to detect. ISUAL often records events that correspond to significant far-ultraviolet (FUV) emissions in the spectrophotometer but have no discernible TLEs in the imager. These FUV events are called \u201cdim\u201d elves. Therefore, it is important to develop mathematical tools to analyse the data to obtain a better evaluation of the number of elves and their occurrence. Multivariate approaches are applied to characterize the unlabelled events. The first approach is the Principal Component Analysis which distinguishes two different groups, one including elves and dim elves. The second approach is the PARallel FACtor analysis which provides a waveform model for each group. These methodologies confirm that FUV signal is the evidence of TLE presence. A crude classification method was then suggested taking into account these results. The proportion of elves, relatively to the considered ISUAL dataset, is found to be about 40%. It is similar to previous results and confirms that relatively weak lightning peak current is sufficient to produce elves. This new strategy demonstrates the potential for discriminating between lightning and TLEs without prior knowledge within the selectivity of the FUV spectral band.\n",

Existing studies have shown that biases in simulated clouds have a significant spatial pattern, which may be transferred to the simulated Rs. Therefore, the evaluation results of Rs simulations may depend on the locations of the ground-based observations. In this study, Rs simulations of 48 models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were first evaluated with ground-based observations from different networks (446 stations in total) from 2000 to 2005. The global mean biases of the CMIP5 Rs simulations were found to vary from 4.8 to 11.9 W m\u22122 when Rs observations from different networks were used as reference data. To reduce the location impact on the evaluation results, CMIP5 simulated Rs were then evaluated with the latest satellite Rs retrieval at 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 spatial resolution by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System, Energy Balanced And Filled (CERES EBAF). It was found that the CMIP5 simulated multi-model mean Rs has a small bias of 2.6 W m\u22122 compared with CERES EBAF over the globe, 4.7 W m\u22122 and 1.7 W m\u22122 over land and oceans, respectively. CERES EBAF Rs was found to have a positive bias of 1.3 W m\u22122 compared with ground-based observations. After removing this bias of CERES EBAF Rs, global mean Rs was estimated to be 185 W m\u22122.\n",

Using 3-hourly rain gauge data, it was found that (1) the CAR frequency exhibits a secular trend and the 10\u201320 decadal oscillation, (2) the trend in CAR frequency is positive in northern Taiwan but negative in central and southern Taiwan, and (3) the CAR rate increased over most of the lower plains but decreased over the mountain range of Taiwan. Diagnoses using the Japanese ReAnalysis (JRA55) data and surface observations indicate that the low-frequency variations in CAR frequency are closely associated with the variations in monsoon southwesterly winds over the South China Sea and island-wide sea breeze convergence. The regional low-level circulation changes are linked to sea surface temperature anomalies over the NINO4 region and its 10\u201320 year (quasi-decadal) oscillation. Regarding the processes that change the CAR rate in the trending patterns, it was found that increases in the moisture flux convergence and the moist (conditional) instability over the lower plains together explain the stronger CAR events in the long run.",

However, little information is available regarding the PM2.5-bound toxic organics, especially their sources, atmospheric transformations, and health implications. In this study, we assessed the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their nitrated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated derivatives (i.e., NPAHs, OHPAHs, and OPAHs, respectively) in PM2.5 collected in Beijing over a one-year period. The median concentration of 23 PAHs, 15 NPAHs, 16 OHPAHs, and 7 OPAHs in PM2.5 was 53.8, 1.14, 1.40, and 3.62 ng m\u22123, respectively. Much higher concentrations and mass percentages for all species were observed in the heating season, indicating a higher toxicity of PM2.5 during this period of time. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to apportion the sources of PAHs and their derivatives. It was found that traffic emissions in the non-heating season, and coal combustion and biomass burning in the heating season, were the major primary sources of PAHs and their derivatives. Secondary formation, however, contributed significantly to the derivatives of PAHs (especially NPAHs and OPAHs) in the non-heating season, suggesting significant impacts of atmospheric transformation on the toxicity of PM2.5.",

Regional NH3 emission estimates with mass-balance or emission ratio approaches are uncertain due to variable NH3 sources and sinks as well as unknown plume correlations with other dairy source tracers. We characterize the spatial distributions of NH3 and methane (CH4) dairy plumes using in-situ surface and airborne measurements in the Tulare dairy feedlot region of the San Joaquin Valley, California during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ 2013 field campaign. Surface NH3 and CH4 mixing ratios exhibit large variability with maxima localized downwind of individual dairy feedlots. The geometric mean NH3:CH4 enhancement ratio derived from surface measurements is 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 ppmv ppmv\u22121. Individual dairy feedlots with spatially distinct NH3 and CH4 source pathways led to statistically significant correlations between NH3 and CH4 in only 68% of the 69 downwind plumes sampled. At longer sampling distances, NH3:CH4 enhancement ratio decreases of at least 20-30% suggest the potential for NH3 deposition as a loss term for plumes within a few kilometers downwind of feedlots. Aircraft boundary layer transect measurements directly above surface mobile measurements in the dairy region show comparable gradients and geometric mean enhancement ratios within measurement uncertainties,even when including NH3 partitioning to sub-micron particles. Individual NH3 and CH4 plumes sampled at close proximity where losses are minimal are not necessarily correlated due to lack of mixing and distinct source pathways. Our analyses have important implications for constraining NH3 sink and plume variability influences on regional NH3 emission estimates and for improving NH3 emission inventory spatial allocations.\n",

The contributions of direct evaporation and transpiration were estimated separately using an extended ET-Tagging partitioning algorithm. In 2005, the contribution of moisture originating from the Poyang Lake region to the local annual precipitation in Southeast China reaches a value of up to 1.2 %. A maximum contribution of 6 % is found near the Poyang Lake region in August. In 2005, 69 % of total tagged precipitation originates from direct evaporation of water, whereas 31 % from transpiration. In winter, precipitation originating from transpired moisture only accounts for around 10 % of the total tagged precipitation, but in the summer season the contribution of transpiration increases up to 50 %. To explore the source-target relations under consideration of the respective precipitation regime, we introduce source-specific precipitation efficiencies. For the period under investigation, the efficiency for direct evaporation generally dominates, except during the comparatively dry August and in the winter months. Our study shows that the location and the magnitude of tagged precipitation show large spatial and temporal variations. The comprehensive interactions between land-surface characteristics and synoptic weather conditions control the annual cycle of the individual contributions to precipitation, emphasizing the important impacts of vegetation cover and land-use on the atmospheric hydrological cycle.\n",

In this study, the sensitivity of tropopause structure and cross-tropopause transport to the choice of numerical model resolution in simulations with explicitly-resolved convection (i.e., no convective parameterization) is examined. For an observed case of overshooting convection, the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model is run for all possible combinations of three horizontal (3-km, 1-km, 333.33-m) and vertical (600-m, 300-m, 150-m) grid resolutions. Although ARW-WRF is successful in producing tropopause-penetrating convection in each case, the depth of overshooting and cross-tropopause transport are found to increase with refinement in the horizontal dimension and decrease with refinement in the vertical dimension. These results are related to changes in storm intensity and the sharpness of the tropopause, where the former is found to increase with refinement in the horizontal dimension and the latter is found to increase with refinement in the vertical dimension. Comparisons of simulated storm altitudes with those observed from ground-based radar reveal large positive biases in simulations where the horizontal resolution is fine and the vertical resolution is coarse.\n",

Results from two decades of contrail observations and numerical simulations are reviewed forming the basis of theoretical model development. The model utilizes cloud theory applied to the dynamics and thermodynamics of jet aircraft exhaust plumes in upper tropospheric conditions. Droplet nuclei include soot particles emitted from aircraft engines and atmospheric particles entrained into the plume. These precursor particles activate into copious homogeneously freezing water droplets as the plume relative humidity rises beyond liquid water saturation. A unimodal size spectrum of ice particles develops wherein ice particles grow to \u03bcm mean sizes. Contrail particle formation is analyzed over a wide range of soot emissions relating to conventional jet fuels as well as to alternative aviation fuels producing much less soot and volatile particle emissions. For current aviation fuels and propulsion technology, the number of contrail ice particles scales roughly in proportion to the number of emitted soot particles that act as water condensation nuclei despite their poor hygroscopicity. Close tothe contrail formation threshold, only few plume particles can be water-activated and freeze. Implications for effects of alternative fuels on contrails, an arena for future scientific exploration, are outlined.\n",

Wilson, California has been measuring column abundances of greenhouse gases in the Los Angeles (LA) basin in the near-infrared spectral region since August 2011. CLARS-FTS measures reflected sunlight and has high sensitivity to absorption and scattering in the boundary layer. In this study, we estimate the retrieval biases caused by aerosol scattering and present a fast and accurate approach to correct for the bias in the CLARS column averaged CO2 mixing ratio product, XCO2. The high spectral resolution of 0.06 cm-1 is exploited to reveal the physical mechanism for the bias. We employ a numerical radiative transfer model to simulate the impact of neglecting aerosol scattering on the CO2 and O2 slant column densities (SCDs) operationally retrieved from CLARS-FTS measurements. These simulations show that the CLARS-FTS operational retrieval algorithm likely underestimates CO2 and O2 abundances over the LA basin in scenes with moderate aerosol loading. The bias in the CO2 and O2 abundances due to neglecting aerosol scattering cannot be canceled by ratioing each other in the derivation of the operational product of XCO2. We propose a new method for approximately correcting the aerosol-induced bias. Results for CLARS XCO2 are compared to direct-sun XCO2 retrievals from a nearby Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) station. The bias-correction approach significantly improves the correlation between the XCO2 retrieved from CLARS and TCCON, demonstrating that this approach can increase the yield of useful data from CLARS-FTS in the presence of moderate aerosol loading.\n",

Sulphur compounds known to be implicated in particle formation and growth were independently measured: sulphate ions and methane sulphonic acid in filtered aerosol samples; and gas-phase di-methyl sulphide for limited periods. Iodine oxide, IO, was determined by a satellite sensor from 2003 to 2009, and by different ground-based sensors at Halley in 2004 and in 2007. Previous model results and mid-latitude observations show that iodine compounds consistent with the large values of IO observed may be responsible for an incresase in number concentrations of small particles. Coastal Antarctica is useful for investigating correlations between particles, sulphur and iodine compounds, because of their large annual cycles and the source of iodine compounds in sea ice. After smoothing all the measured data by several days, the shapes of the annual cycles in particle concentration at Halley and at Neumayer are approximated by linear combinations of the shapes of sulphur compounds and IO, but not by sulphur compounds alone. However, there is no short-term correlation between IO and particle concentration. The apparent correlation by eye after smoothing but not in the short term suggests that iodine compounds and particles are sourced some distance offshore. This suggests that new particles formed from iodine compounds are viable, i.e. they can last long enough to grow to the larger particles that contribute to Cloud Condensation Nuclei, rather than being simply collected by existing particles. If so there is significant potential for climate feedback near the sea ice zone via the aerosol indirect effect.\n",

In lake models, one essential parameter is water clarity, parameterized via the light extinction coefficient, Kd, for which a global constant value is usually used. We used direct eddy covariance fluxes and basic meteorological measurements coupled with lake water temperature and clarity measurements from a boreal lake to estimate the performance of two lake models, LAKE and FLake. These models represent two 1D modeling frameworks broadly used in NWP. The results show that the lake models are very sensitive to changes in Kd when it is lower than 0.5 m\u22121. The progress of thermal stratification depended strongly on Kd. In dark water simulations the mixed layer was shallower, longwave and turbulent heat losses higher and therefore the average water column temperatures lower than in clear water simulations. Thus, changes in water clarity can also affect the onset of ice cover. The more complex LAKE modeled the seasonal thermocline deepening whereas it remained virtually constant during summer in the FLake model. Both models overestimated the surface water temperatures by about 1\u00b0C and latent heat flux by >30%, but the variation in heat storage and sensible heat flux were adequately simulated. Our results suggest that, at least for humic lakes, a lake-specific, but not time-depending, constant value for Kd can be used and that a global mapping of Kd would be most beneficial in regions with relatively clear lakes, e.g. in lakes at high altitudes.",

Due to changes in particle size, composition, and shape that are caused by physical processes and reactive chemistry, optical properties vary during transport, contributing uncertainty in the calculation of radiative forcing. Hematite is the major absorbing species of mineral dust. In this study, we analyzed the extinction cross sections of nigrosin and hematite particles using cavity ring-down aerosol extinction spectroscopy (CRD-AES) and have measured particle shape and size distributions using transmission electron microscopy. Nigrosin was also used in this study as a spherical standard for absorbing particles. The size-selected nigrosin particles have a narrow size distribution, with extinction cross sections that are described by Mie theory. In contrast, the size distribution of size-selected hematite particles is more polydisperse. The extinction cross sections were modeled using Mie theory and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The DDA was used to model more complex shapes that account for the surface roughness and particle geometry. Of the four models used, Mie theory was the simplest to implement, but had significant error with a 26.1% difference from the CRD-AES results. By increasing the complexity of the models using the DDA, we determined that spheroids had a 14.7% difference, roughened spheres a 12.8% difference, and roughened spheroids a 11.2% difference from the experimental results. Using additional parameters that account for particle shape is necessary to model the optical properties of hematite particles and leads to improved extinction cross sections for modeling aerosol optical properties.\n",

In this study, the observations from different GNSS are combined to retrieve atmospheric parameters based on the real-time precise point positioning technique. The atmospheric parameters, retrieved from multi-GNSS observations of a 180 days period from about 100 globally distributed stations, including zenith total delay (ZTD), integrated water vapor (IWV), horizontal gradient and slant total delay (STD), are analyzed and evaluated. The water vapor radiometer data and a numerical weather model, the operational analysis of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), are used to independently validate the performance of individual GNSS and also demonstrate the benefits of multi-constellation GNSS for real-time atmospheric monitoring. Our results show that the GLONASS and BeiDou have the potential capability for real-time atmospheric parameters retrieval for time-critical meteorological applications as GPS does, and the combination of multi-GNSS observations can improve the performance of a single-system solution in meteorological applications with higher accuracy and robustness. The multi-GNSS processing greatly increase the number of STDs. The mean and standard deviation of STDs between each GNSS and ECMWF exhibit a good stability as function of the elevation angle, the azimuth angle, and time in general. An obvious latitude dependence is confirmed by a map of station specific mean and standard deviations. Such real-time atmospheric products, provided by multi-GNSS processing with higher accuracy, stronger reliability and better distribution, might be highly valuable for atmospheric sounding systems, especially for nowcasting of extreme weather.\n",

June-July monthly mean cloud amount and liquid water and ice cloud optical thickness from MODIS for both observations are calculated and compared. Results show errors increase with decreasing sample numbers for monthly means in cloud amount and cloud optical thickness.

The ice cloud optical properties are estimated through linear parameterizations of ambient temperature and ice water content. We evaluate the new parameterization against existing parameterizations used in RTTOV. We compare infrared observations from IIR, onboard CALIPSO, against RTTOV simulations of the observations. The simulations are performed using two different products of ice cloud profiles, retrieved from the synergy between space-based radar and lidar observations. These are the 2C-ICE and DARDAR products. We optimized the parameterization by testing different SCSM databases, derived from different shapes of the particle size distribution, and weighting the volume extinction coefficient of the ensemble model. By selecting a large global data set of ice cloud profiles of visible optical depths between 0.03 and 4, we found that the simulations, based on the optimized SCSM database parameterization, reproduces the observations with a mean bias of only 0.43 K, and a standard deviation of 6.85 K. The optimized SCSM database parameterization can also be applied to any other radiative transfer model.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSeveral important improvements have been made in recent MODIS Collection 6 aerosol retrievals, but few regional validations are conducted. We compared Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) retrievals over China, and evaluated their performance with ground observations. Sampling frequency of DB was much higher than that of DT, which was mainly caused by unavailable retrieval of DT in bright surface and heavy pollution conditions. It is found that merged AOD will miss some cases if it was determined only by vegetation density. Collocated comparison shows that DT AOD was substantially higher than DB with seasonal difference exceeding 0.3-0.4 over eastern China. However, when all available retrievals were considered, DT AOD was obviously lower than DB in all the seasons except spring due to their large difference in spatial coverage in high-AOD conditions. DB can well reveal spatial extent of the widespread haze pollution while there were few values in DT. More than one half of the situations with AOD\u2009>\u20091.0 was missed by DT, which largely underestimated the common regional haze pollution in eastern China. Ground validations show that DT tended to overestimate the aerosol loading by underestimation of the surface contribution and SSA of aerosols. DB performed generally well with higher accuracy in northern China, but exhibited obvious underestimation in northwestern and southern China. Despite of slight decrease in accuracy, DB retrievals with all quality enable a large increase in spatial coverage, especially when dense haze clouds existed.\n",

The results show that the seasonal cycle of river discharge is generally modelled well in the low and mid latitudes, but not in the high latitudes, where the peak discharge (due to snow and ice melting) is underestimated. For the annual mean discharge, the DGVMs chained with the routing model show an underestimation. Furthermore the 30-year trend of discharge is also under-estimated. For the inter-annual variability of discharge, a skill score based on overlapping of probability density functions (PDFs) suggests that most models correctly reproduce the observed variability (correlation coefficient higher than 0.5; i.e. models account for 50% of observed inter-annual variability) except for the Lena, Yenisei, Yukon, and the Congo river basins. In addition, we compared the simulated runoff from different simulations where models were forced with either fixed or varying land use. This suggests that both seasonal and annual mean runoff has been little affected by land use change, but that the trend itself of runoff is sensitive to land use change. None of the models when considered individually show significantly better performances than any other and in all basins. This suggests that based on current modelling capability, a regional-weighted average of multi-model ensemble projections might be appropriate to reduce the bias in future projection of global river discharge.\n",

Anatahan (Mariana Islands) is a remote volcano in the western North Pacific. Available ground-based measurements of sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas emissions at Anatahan place it among the largest volcanic SO2 sources worldwide. These ground-based measurements, however, are restricted to eruptive intervals. Anatahan's activity since 2003 has been dominated temporally by prolonged periods of quiescence. Using ten years of satellite observations from OMI, AIRS, SCIAMACHY, and GOME-2, we report highly variable SO2 emissions within and between eruptive and quiescent intervals at Anatahan. We find close correspondence between levels of activity reported at the volcano and levels of SO2 emissions detected from space. Eruptive SO2 emission rates have a mean value of ~ 6400 t d\u22121, but frequently are in excess of 20,000 t d\u22121. Conversely, SO2 emissions during quiescent intervals are below the detection limit of space-based sensors, and therefore are not likely to exceed ~ 300 t d\u22121. We show that while Anatahan occupies a quiescent state for 85% of the past ten years, only ~ 15% of total SO2 emissions over this interval occur during quiescence, with the remaining ~ 85% released in short-duration but intense syn-eruptive degassing. We propose that the integration of multi-year satellite datasets and activity histories are apowerful complement to targeted ground-based campaign measurements in better describing the longterm degassing behaviour of remote volcanoes.\n",

The results suggest that the boreal summer SAH is more significantly influenced by preceding ENSO events in the easterly phase of the QBO than in the westerly phase. The change in the ENSO\u2013SAH relationship in the different QBO phases may be attributable to the change in the ENSO-induced sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Specifically, ENSO's influence on the following summer's TIO SST is more significant when the QBO is in its easterly phase than westerly phase. Further analysis showed that the change in the connection between ENSO and the TIO SST in the different QBO phases may be attributable to change in the anomalous tropical Indian Ocean cell (IOC) associated with ENSO. In particular, the anomalous IOC induced by anomalous Walker circulation over the tropical Pacific is stronger and located further west in QBO easterly than westerly phase. This leads to stronger descending motion and larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase. These larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase could exert a more significant influence on the tropospheric temperature through moist adjustment, which subsequently results in stronger SAH variability.\n",

We base our analysis on the ratio of ice condensates to the total condensates (Phase Ratio, PR). Its transition at 90% (PR90) and its links with other relevant variables are evaluated using the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP) climatology, reanalysis data and other satellite observations. In 13 of 16 models, the PR90 transition height occurs too low (6km to 8.4km) and at temperatures too warm (-13.9\u00b0C to -32.5\u00b0C) compared to observations (8.6km, -33.7\u00b0C); features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with respect to ice above 6.5km. However, this bias would be slightly reduced by using the lidar simulator. In convective regimes (more humid air and precipitation), the observed cloud phase transition occurs at a warmer temperature than for subsidence regimes (less humid air and precipitation). Only few models manage to roughly replicate the observed correlations with humidity (5/16), vertical velocity (5/16) and precipitation (4/16); 3/16 perform well for all these parameters (MPI-ESM, NCAR-CAM5, NCHU). Using an observation-based Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram, we illustrate that the Bergeron-Findeisen (BF) process is a necessary condition for models to represent the observed features. Finally, the best models are those that include more complex microphysics.\n",

We find that total ozone depletion in both hemispheres is dependent on cold temperatures (below 192K) and associated heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles. Reactions limited to warmer temperatures above 192 K, or on binary liquid aerosols, yield little modeled polar ozone depletion in either hemisphere. An imposed factor of three enhancement in stratospheric sulfate increases ozone loss by up to 20 DU in the Antarctic and 15 DU in the Arctic in this model. Such enhanced sulfate loads are similar to those observed following recent relatively small volcanic eruptions since 2005, and imply impacts on the search for polar ozone recovery. Ozone losses are strongly sensitive to temperature, with a test case cooler by 2K producing as much as 30 DU additional ozone loss in the Antarctic and 40 DU in the Arctic. A new finding of this paper is the use of the temporal behavior and variability of ClONO2 and HCl as indicators of the efficacy of heterogeneous chemistry. Transport of ClONO2 from the southern subpolar regions near 55-65\u00b0S to higher latitudes near 65-75\u00b0S provides a flux of NOx from more sunlit latitudes to the edge of the vortex and is important for ozone loss in this model. Comparisons between modeled and observed total column and profile ozone perturbations, ClONO2 abundances, and the rate of change of HCl bolster confidence in these conclusions.\n",

However, previous studies were limited by using proxies for convection or the bias of the tropopause data. Here, the tropopause-penetrating convection is investigated based on the sole use of observational products from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar data and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC). The result shows that the frequency of precipitation-top heights above the monthly mean tropopause in the tropics is reduced logarithmically if the cold-point tropopause is adopted instead of the lapse-rate tropopause. Using the collocated COSMIC and precipitation radar observations, the tropopause-penetrating convection, i.e., the convection with the precipitation-top height above the lapse-rate tropopause, can be found over the summer monsoon regions and some continental regions. The averaged relative precipitation-top heights of tropopause-penetrating convective clusters are about 0.2\u20130.5 km without significant land-ocean difference, while equivalent radii of clusters are 2.7\u20133.5 km over land and 0.2\u20130.5 km larger than those over ocean. These areal and vertical extents are smaller than those reported by previous studies. Furthermore, the collocated temperature profiles show that the tropopause-penetrating convection generates warming in the upper troposphere and cooling near the lapse-rate tropopause and in the lower stratosphere. Moreover, the tropopause-penetrating convection leads to a rapid (within 20 minutes) lift of the lapse-rate tropopause by the adiabatic lofting within the convection (within a 10-km radius).\n",

The WRF model was driven by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with the Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics (GOLD) component (GFDL-ESM2G) output over China at the resolution of 30 km for the present day (1976\u20132005) and near future (2031\u20132050) under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. The results demonstrate that with improved resolution and better representation of finer-scale physical process, dynamical downscaling adds value to the regional precipitation simulation. WRF downscaling generally simulates more reliable spatial distributions of total precipitation and extreme precipitation in China with higher spatial pattern correlations and closer magnitude. It is able to successfully eliminate the artificial precipitation maximum area simulated by GFDL-ESM2G over the west of the Sichuan Basin, along the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in both summer and winter. Besides, the regional annual cycle and frequencies of precipitation intensity are also well depicted by WRF. In the future projections, under the RCP4.5 scenario, both models project that summer precipitation over most parts of China will increase, especially in western and northern China, and that precipitation over some southern regions is projected to decrease. The projected increase of future extreme precipitation makes great contributions to the total precipitation increase. In southern regions, the projected larger extreme precipitation amounts accompanied with fewer extreme precipitation frequencies suggest that future daily extreme precipitation intensity is like to increase in these regions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA CNT-based parameterization for heterogenous ice nucleation, including explicit dependencies of the nucleation rates on the number concentration, size and composition of the ambient aerosol population, is implemented in a cloud-scale, large-eddy simulation model and evaluated against Arctic mixed-phase cloud events observed during ISDAC. An important feature of the parameterization is that the ice nucleation efficiency of each considered aerosol type is described using a contact angle distributionwhich evolves with time so that the model accounts for the inhibition of ice nucleation as the most efficient ice forming particles are nucleated and scavenged. The model gives a reasonable representation of first-order (ice water paths) and second-order (ice crystal size distributions) ice microphysical properties. The production of new ice crystals in the upper part of the cloud, essential to guarantee sustained mixed-phase conditions, is found to be controlled mostly by the competition between radiative cooling (resulting in more aerosol particles becoming efficient ice nuclei as the temperature decreases), cloud top entrainment (entraining fresh particles into the cloud) and nucleation scavenging of the ice forming aerosol particles. The relative contribution of each process is mostly determined by the cloud-top temperature and the entrainment rates. Accounting for the evolution of the contact angle PDF with time seems to be essential to capture the persistence of in-cloud ice productionwithout having to, for example, increase the free tropospheric aerosol concentration. Although limited to only three cases, and despite important limitations of the parameterization (e.g. the present version only considers dust and black carbon as potential ice nuclei), the results suggest that modeling the time evolution of the IN population ability to form ice is required to accurately model Arctic mixed-phase cloud processes.\n",

Here, we use a high resolution spatial and temporal seamless gridded land surface forcing dataset to provide an assessment of recent spatio-temporal patterns in temperature extremes over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We asked: 1) How are temperature extremes changing across the different regions of CONUS? 2) How do changes in extremes vary on seasonal, annual and decadal scales? 3) How do changes in extremes relate to changes in mean conditions? and 4) Do extremes relate to major modes of ocean\u2013atmosphere variability? We derive a subset of the CLIMDEX extreme indices from the North American Land Data Assimilation phase 2 forcing dataset. While there were warming trends in all indices, daytime temperature extremes warmed more than nighttime. Spring warming was the strongest and most extensive across CONUS, and summer experienced the strongest and most extensive decrease in cold extremes. Increase in winter warm extremes appeared weakening relative to the rapid 1950\u20131990 increase found in previous studies. The Northeast and Midwest experienced the most warming, while the Northwest and North Great Plains saw the least. We found changes in average temperatures were more associated with changes in cold extremes than warm extremes. Since 2006 there have been 5 years when more than 5% of the U.S. experienced at least 90 warm days, something not observed in the previous 25 years. The unusually warm first decade of 21st century could have been associated with the warm conditions of near ENSO-neutral phase of the decade, and possibly amplified by anthropogenic forcing. The widespread, lengthy, and severe extreme hot events documented here during the past three decades underscore the need to implement thoughtful adaptation plans in the very near future, to the growing evidence of increasing warm extremes across United States.\n",

All the 18 FLFs were connected to the strike object on ground, with 14 of them being also in contact with the downward leader tip. For 11 located events showing FLFs in contact with the downward leader tip, the FLF 2D length ranged from 51 to 200 m and the time interval between the end of exposure of the FLF frame and the return-stroke onset ranged from 42 to 106 \u00b5s. We inferred that the FLFs mostly consisted of relatively-low-conductivity streamers, based on the following observations and estimates. (a) The rates, at which the 11 FLFs were replaced by channels capable of guiding return-stroke waves ranged from 0.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 m/s to 2.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 m/s, which is comparable to leader speeds in virgin air (in the same records). (b) The overwhelming majority of downward leaders continued stepping while being connected to ground via FLFs. (c) The average electric field along FLFs is one to two orders of magnitude higher than expected for hot, leader-like channels.

In this work the evolution of the advective BDC for the period 1979\u20132012 is evaluated and compared in three modern reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA and JRA-55). Three different estimates of the BDC are computed for each reanalysis, one based on the definition of the residual circulation and two indirect estimates derived from momentum and thermodynamic balances. The comparison among the nine estimates shows substantial uncertainty in the mean magnitude (~40%) but significant common variability. The tropical upwelling series show variability linked to the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and also reflect extreme events such as major Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW) and volcanic eruptions. The trend analysis suggests a strengthening of tropical upwelling of around 2-5%/decade throughout the layer 100\u201310 hPa. The global spatial structure of the BDC trends provides evidence of an overall accelerationof the circulation in both hemispheres, with qualitative agreement among the estimates. The global BDC trends are mainly linked to changes in the boreal winter season and can be tracked to long-term increases in the resolved wave drag in both hemispheres.\n",

However, their influence on the interannual variability of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols has not been systematically investigated from a global perspective. We examine biomass burning emissions as a driver of interannual variability of large-scale abundances of short-lived constituents such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydroxyl radicals (OH), ozone and aerosols using the GISS ModelE composition-climate model and a range of observations, with an emphasis on satellite information. Our model captures the observed variability of the constituents examined in most cases, but with substantial underestimates in boreal regions. The strongest interannual variability on a global scale is found for carbon monoxide (~10% for its global annual burden), while the lowest is found for tropospheric ozone (~1% for its global annual burden). Regionally, aerosol optical depth shows variability that exceeds 50%. Areas of strong variability include the tropical land regions and northern high latitudes, while even regions in the northern mid-latitudes experience substantial inteannual variability of aerosols. Ozone variability peaks over Equatorial Asia in boreal autumn, partly due to varying biomass burning emissions, and over the western and central Pacific in the rest of the year, mainly due to meteorological fluctuations. We find that biomass burning emissions are almost entirely responsible for global CO interannual variability, and similarly important for OH variability. The same is true for global and regional aerosol variability, especially when not taking into account dust and sea-salt particles. We show that important implications can arise from such interannual influences for regional climate and air quality.\n",

A novel auto-adaptive Tikhonov-Philips-type approach called AEROIASI is used to retrieve vertical profiles of dust extinction coefficient at 10 \u00b5m for most cloud-free IASI pixels, both over land and ocean. The dust vertical distribution derived from AEROIASI is shown to agree remarkably well with along-track transects of CALIOP space-borne lidar vertical profiles (mean biases less than 110 m, correlation of 0.95 and precision of 260 m for mean altitudes of the dust layers). AEROIASI allows the daily characterization of the 3D transport pathways across East Asia of two dust plumes originating from the Gobi and North Chinese deserts. From AEROIASI retrievals, we provide evidence that (i) both dust plumes are transported over the Beijing region and the Yellow Sea as elevated layers above a shallow boundary layer, (ii) as they progress eastwards, the dust layers are lifted up by the ascending motions near the core of the extratropical cyclone and (iii) when being transported over the warm waters of the Japan Sea, turbulent mixing in the deep marine boundary layer leads to high dust concentrations down to the surface. AEROIASI observations and model simulations also show that the progression of the dust plumes across East Asia is tightly related to the advancing cold front of the extratropical cyclone.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSeasonal precipitation forecasts are important sources of information for early drought and famine warnings in West Africa. This study presents an assessment of the monthly precipitation forecast of the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) for three agro-ecological zones (Sudan-Sahel, Sudan and Guinean Zone) of the Volta basin. The CFSv2 performance is evaluated for the Sahel drought 1983 and for all August months of the reforecast period (1982\u20132009) with lead times up to 8 months using a quantile-quantile transformation for bias correction. In addition, an operational experiment is performed for the rainy season 2013 to analyse the performance of a dynamical downscaling approach for this region. 22 CFSv2 ensemble members initialized in February 2013 are transferred to a resolution of 10 km x 10 km using the Weather and Research Forecasting model (WRF). Since the uncorrected CFSv2 precipitation forecasts are characterised by a high uncertainty (up to 175% of the observed variability), the quantile-quantile transformation can clearly reduce this overestimation with the potential to provide skillful and valuable early warnings of precipitation deficits and excess up to six months in ahead, particularly for the Sudan-Sahel zone. The operational experiment illustrates that CFSv2-WRF can reduce the CFSv2 uncertainty (up to 69%) for monthly precipitation and the onset of the rainy season but has still strong deficits regarding the northward progression of the rain belt. Further studies are necessary for a more robust assessment of the techniques applied in this study to confirm these promising outcomes.\n",

This study presents the first real-time high resolution aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) measurements of submicron non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) at the urban roadside in Hong Kong from March to July 2013 with the aim to identify major sources, to assess local and non-local emissions and characterize trends at different time scales. Organics were dominant, with fresh primary organic aerosol (POA) representing two thirds of the total measured organics. Cooking contributions in organic aerosol were assessed directly for the first time in Hong Kong and exceeded those related to vehicles although traffic was still the major PM1 source when elemental carbon (EC) was included. These findings were supported by additional measurements including traffic data, EC/OC and VOC data. Springtime concentrations were about double of those in summer, due to a strong seasonal transition which affected metrological conditions and street-level circulation. Local formation of secondary species was not clearly discernible in either season. The elemental composition of organic aerosol remained stable with similar elemental ratios across the covered seasons: OM/OC: 1.49 \u00b1 0.13, O/C: 0.25 \u00b1 0.10, H/C: 1.68 \u00b1 0.08 for spring and OM/OC: 1.43 \u00b1 0.14, O/C: 0.21 \u00b1 0.11, H/C: 1.69 \u00b1 0.08 for summer. Diurnal changes in H/C and O/C as a result of mixing of primary organic aerosol (POA) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) were evident in the van Krevelen plot.\n",

Transport paths are separated into two legs: \u201cconvective uplift\u201d (boundary layer to detrainment) and \u201cradiative ascent\u201d (detrainment to tropopause). The following three diagnostic measures are used: source location, source-to-tropopause transport time, and the source \u201cinfluence\u201d (i.e., the fraction of air with short transport times) at 100\u2009hPa. Ensemble means and standard deviations identify \u201crobust features\u201d (i.e., common to all ensemble members) while experimental hybrid calculations explain model-to-model discrepancies. Convective uplift is a major contributor to uncertainties in boundary layer-to-tropopause transport times and source locations. Spatial patterns of boundary layer influence at 100\u2009hPa are nevertheless robust. Detrainment-to-tropopause transport times are robust despite substantial model-to-model variations of convective detrainment height because ascent rates are faster at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Detrainment-to-tropopause transport also has robust horizontal spatial patterns for both convective sources and convective influence, particularly during boreal winter. Most model-to-model discrepancies occur at small spatial scales and are associated with differing distributions of convection. The location of maximum convective influence associated with the Asian summer monsoon is a notable exception. This exceptionally large discrepancy is associated primarily with radiative ascent. The fact that the observed maxima of important tropospheric constituents are collocated with the maximum convective influence for the diabatic calculations but not for the kinematic calculations suggests that diabatic trajectories could be more reliable in this region.\n",

As for the physical process of LBEs, Wu et al. (2014) considered that LBEs may be very similar to the typical lightning RS (RS-like process) or caused by an initial continuous current pulse (ICC-like process) in upward lightning flashes. We assume that the lightning channel length of LBEs ranges from 500\u2009m to 1000\u2009m, and the height of tall object struck by LBEs is from 100\u2009m to 300\u2009m. By using the bouncing wave model, we found that only when the injected current waveform of LBEs is characterized with a symmetric Gaussian pulse, the simulated far-field waveform of LBEs both for RS-like process and ICC-like process is similar to that observed by Wu et al. (2014). For striking tall objects with heights from 100\u2009m and 300\u2009m, the FCCFs of LBEs are positively correlated with its channel length and derivatives of injected current waveform, and the FCCF for RS-like process is about similar to that for ICC-like process. However, the FCCFs of LBEs are very different from lightning RS in summer thunderstorm; that is to say, the FCCFs developed for the well-known lightning RS in summer thunderstorm are not suitable for LBEs.\n",

X-ray intensities between 10 and 1000 times that of normal background were observed in conjunction with strong electric fields. Both negative and positive polarity electric fields (as referenced to the vertical field) produced X-rays, which lasted for time scales on the order of tens of seconds. It was also observed that the increased X-ray intensity would return to near background levels after lightning reduced the local electric field. The observations indicate that X-rays observed above background are most likely produced by a runaway electron process occurring in the strong static electric field present in thunderstorms. The production of runaway electrons can occur over long periods of time without causing an electrical breakdown. This may provide a leakage current that limits the large scale electric field to values near the runaway threshold, especially in regions where the thunderstorm charging rate is low.\n",

However, most observational data sets do not confirm the model results. B\u00f6nisch et al. (2011) and Ray et al. (2010) indicate a strengthening of the BDC in its shallow branch and a weakening in its deep branch. In contrast, balloon-borne measurements and Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding satellite observations show no significant acceleration of the BDC at Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes. In our study, the change of the BDC in the recent past is analyzed from simulations with the chemistry-climate model ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry. As the sign of change considerably depends on the underlying forcings, namely, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), as well as their interactions, we separate their contributions by using sensitivity simulations. The changes in tropical upward mass flux indicate a strengthening of the BDC between 1960 and 2000 in NH winter season in the lower and a weakening in the upper stratosphere with a change in sign at 10\u00a0hPa. While the lower stratospheric increase of about 2%/decade is caused by equal contributions from rising GHGs and ODSs, rising ODS concentrations counteract the GHG effect in the middle and upper stratosphere with a total decrease of about 0.5%/decade. Changes in mean age of air show a decrease of about 0.13\u00a0yr/decade in the lower and middle stratosphere and a slight increase in the Arctic upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, which is induced by interactions between the forcings.\n",

In winter, heavy precipitation and floods have been linked with intense moisture transport events associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs), yet no large-scale atmospheric precursors have been linked to summer flooding in the UK. This study investigates the link between ARs and extreme rainfall from two perspectives: (1) Given an extreme rainfall event, is there an associated AR? (2) Given an AR, is there an associated extreme rainfall event? We identify extreme rainfall events using the UK Met Office daily rain gauge data set and link these to ARs using two different horizontal resolution atmospheric data sets (ERA-Interim and Twentieth Century Reanalysis). The results show that less than 35% of winter ARs and less than 15% of summer ARs are associated with an extreme rainfall event. Consistent with previous studies, at least 50% of extreme winter rainfall events are associated with an AR. However, less than 20% of the identified summer extreme rainfall events are associated with an AR. The dependence of the water vapor transport intensity threshold used to define an AR on the years included in the study, and on the length of the season, is also examined. Including a longer period (1900\u20132012) compared to previous studies (1979\u20132005) reduces the water vapor transport intensity threshold used to define an AR.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWhile snow accumulation over central Greenland has been extensively studied, interannual variability of snowfall in the region is not well understood due to a dearth of observations. The Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project at Summit, Greenland, offers a unique, ground-based opportunity to study precipitation in central Greenland where the surface mass balance is positive. Combining data from a Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS), Millimeter-wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR), and snow stake field, the annual cycle of precipitation at Summit is examined. Average daily snowfall is higher by a factor of 3 from June to October compared to November to May, while surface height change is only higher by 15% during the same timeframes. This reduced variability in surface height is explained by the seasonally varying nature of latent heat flux, compaction, and wind contributions. The ICECAPS remote sensors and stake field measurements do not agree as far as total annual water equivalent. This discrepancy is likely due to a low bias in the POSS and MMCR snowfall retrievals for Summit. To further examine the seasonal cycle, snowfall measurements by the POSS were linked to local meteorological parameters, including wind direction, liquid water path (LWP), 2\u2009m temperature, and precipitable water vapor. An observed wind direction and moisture dependence are consistent with snowfall being linked to pulses of moist air that originate over nearby, ice-free ocean, a resource that becomes more readily available in summertime as the winter sea ice retreats. LWP is shown to have little relationship to snowfall, indicating that ice-phase precipitation processes are quite important for snowfall at Summit.\n",

This study provides metadata and reference data to homogenize observed Rs, from which the decadal variability of Rs over China can be accurately derived. From 1958 to 1990, diffuse solar radiation (Rsdif) and direct solar radiation (Rsdir) were measured separately, and Rs was calculated as their sum. The pyranometers used to measure Rsdif had a strong sensitivity drift problem, which introduced a spurious decreasing trend into the observed Rsdif and Rs data, whereas the observed Rsdir did not suffer from this sensitivity drift problem. From 1990 to 1993, instruments and measurement methods were replaced and measuring stations were restructured in China, which introduced an abrupt increase in the observed Rs. Intercomparisons between observation-based and model-based Rs performed in this research show that sunshine duration (SunDu)-derived Rs is of high quality and can be used as reference data to homogenize observed Rs data. The homogenized and adjusted data of observed Rs combines the advantages of observed Rs in quantifying hourly to monthly variability and SunDu-derived Rs in depicting decadal variability and trend. Rs averaged over 105 stations in China decreased at \u22122.9 W m\u22122 per decade from 1961 to 1990 and remained stable afterward. This decadal variability is confirmed by the observed Rsdir and diurnal temperature ranges, and can be reproduced by high-quality Earth System Models. However, neither satellite retrievals nor reanalyses can accurately reproduce such decadal variability over China.\n",

However, the inconsistency between the real-time satellite precipitation and gauge-based retrospective data may introduce large systematic bias in near-real-time hydrological monitoring. Here we attempted to integrate the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) real-time precipitation (3B42RTV7) into a 62\u2009year gauge-based retrospective product, the IGSNRR (Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research) dataset through matching their cumulative probability functions toward a near-real-time hydrological monitoring consistent with the long-term retrospective simulations. A nearly 11\u2009year period from March 2000 to December 2010 was taken as the training period to establish the satellite-gauge precipitation relationship, which was employed in the period of 2011\u20132013 to evaluate the performance of the adjustment. The results show that the adjusted 3B42RTV7 matches well with IGSNRR precipitation, while the unadjusted data tend to overestimate precipitation. Forced by the adjusted 3B42RTV7, the Variable Infiltration Capacity model can reproduce the IGSNRR-derived hydrographs and high/low flows better than the model forced by the unadjusted data. The percentiles of the adjusted hydrological estimates in the 62\u2009year estimates from IGSNRR are used for near-real-time assessment of hydrological extremes. The hydrological monitoring assisted by the adjusted satellite precipitation, which enables the employment of the long-term ground observations, is able to capture more detailed drought information than that before adjustment. Our experiment suggests that the satellite real-time precipitation, after adjustment, can generate the current hydrological conditions which can be directly compared with the long-term climatology, and thus facilitates near-real-time diagnosis and detection of hydrological extremes.\n",

Bias correction is proposed as a simple method to disaggregate soil moisture to a scale more appropriate for hydrological applications. Temporal stability of soil moisture and TB was demonstrated at the Little Washita and Little River Experimental Watersheds using in situ observations and the Community Microwave Emissions Model. Decomposition of the mean square difference (MSD) between the watershed average soil moisture and TB showed that bias was a major contributor to differences between watershed average and local-scale soil moisture and TB, particularly at sites with high MSD. The mean RMSD between watershed average and local soil moisture was 0.04\u2009m3\u2009m\u22123 and 0.06\u2009m3\u2009m\u22123 at Little River and Little Washita, respectively. Following a simple bias correction the RMSD was reduced to 0.03\u2009m3\u2009m\u22123 at both sites. Considering multiple incidence angles at both horizontal and vertical polarization, bias correction of watershed average TBV reduced the RMSD by approximately 75% and 45% and TBH RMSD by 68% and 36% for Little River and Little Washita, respectively, at all incidence angles. Therefore, at subsatellite grid scale, bias correction can be considered a viable technique for downscaling passive microwave observations and soil moisture retrievals.\n",

The regression model explained 37.6% of the variation in the SPEI reconstruction during the calibration period from 1950 to 2010. Comparison with previous drought reconstructions confirmed the robustness of our reconstruction. The 20th century has been a relatively wet period during the past 300\u2009years. The SPEI showed quasi 2, 5, and 10\u2009year cycles. Several pluvials and droughts with covariability over large areas were revealed clearly in the reconstruction. The two longest pluvials (lasting for 12\u2009years), separated by 50\u2009years, appeared in the 1900s and the 1960s. The most severe drought occurred from 1739 to 1761 and from 1886 to 1911 was the wettest period since 1710. Compared to previous investigations of hydroclimatic changes in the western Tianshan Mountains, our reconstruction revealed more low-frequency variability and indicated that climate in the western Tianshan Mountains shifted from dry to wet in 1886. This regime shift was generally consistent with other moisture reconstructions for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and northern Pakistan and may have resulted from a strengthened westerly circulation. The opposite hydrological trends in the western Tianshan Mountains and southeastern Tibetan Plateau reveal a substantial influence of strengthened westerlies and weakening of the Indian summer monsoon.",

These MAC results show that OC content can be an important contributor to light absorption when present in significant quantities (>0.9 OC/TC), source emissions have variable absorption spectra, and nonbiomass combustion sources can be significant contributors to BrC.\n",

Here we review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability on the properties of different drought types. The downscaled and bias-corrected data from five general circulation models (GCMs) were used to produce an ensemble of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed, through a relative entropy approach and were used for drought analysis. A novel Multivariate Drought Index was then employed for an integrated quantification of all physical forms of drought. We studied the spatial patterns of drought properties and performed multivariate frequency analysis for each planning region in Texas to recognize the distribution of potential drought hazard areas under climate change impact by formulating a Drought Hazard Index. A drought vulnerability assessment was also carried out by taking into consideration various socioeconomic factors, leading to the development of socioeconomic Drought Vulnerability Index. A set of composite drought risk maps that combines hazard and vulnerability analysis were developed. This study also explored the cause-effect relationship between the drought events and several hydroclimatic triggers. A transfer entropy measure was used to quantify the causal relationships, thus indicating the predominant future drought triggers. Overall, the findings are expected to help achieve an effective drought mitigation strategy for the state of Texas.\n",

However, the differences between observations and brightness temperature simulations exhibit a systematic along-track striping noise for all channels. In this study, a set of 22 \u201coptimal\u201d filters is designed to remove the striping noise in different channels. It is shown that the original method for ATMS striping noise mitigation developed by Qin et al. () can be simplified and made suitable for use in an operational context. Impacts of striping noise mitigation on small-scale weather features are investigated by comparing ATMS cloud liquid water path (LWP) retrieved before and after striping noise mitigation. It is shown that the optimal filters do not affect small-scale cloud features while smoothing out striping noise in brightness temperatures. It is also shown that the striping noise is present in the LWP retrievals if the striping noise in brightness temperatures of ATMS channels 1 and 2 is not removed. The amplitude of the striping noise in LWP is linearly related to the magnitude of striping noise in ATMS brightness temperature observations.\n",

This paper evaluates cloud-resolving model (CRM) and cloud system-resolving model (CSRM) simulations of a midlatitude cirrus case with comprehensive observations collected under the auspices of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program and with spaceborne observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration A-train satellites. The CRM simulations are driven with periodic boundary conditions and ARM forcing data, whereas the CSRM simulations are driven by the ERA-Interim product. Vertical profiles of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speeds are reasonably well simulated by the CSRM and CRM, but there are remaining biases in the temperature, wind speeds, and relative humidity, which can be mitigated through nudging the model simulations toward the observed radiosonde profiles. Simulated vertical velocities are underestimated in all simulations except in the CRM simulations with grid spacings of 500\u00a0m or finer, which suggests that turbulent vertical air motions in cirrus clouds need to be parameterized in general circulation models and in CSRM simulations with horizontal grid spacings on the order of 1\u00a0km. The simulated ice water content and ice number concentrations agree with the observations in the CSRM but are underestimated in the CRM simulations. The underestimation of ice number concentrations is consistent with the overestimation of radar reflectivity in the CRM simulations and suggests that the model produces too many large ice particles especially toward the cloud base. Simulated cloud profiles are rather insensitive to perturbations in the initial conditions or the dimensionality of the model domain, but the treatment of the forcing data has a considerable effect on the outcome of the model simulations. Despite considerable progress in observations and microphysical parameterizations, simulating the microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative properties of cirrus remains challenging. Comparing model simulations with observations from multiple instruments and observational platforms is important for revealing model deficiencies and for providing rigorous benchmarks. However, there still is considerable need for reducing observational uncertainties and providing better observations especially for relative humidity and for the size distribution and chemical composition of aerosols in the upper troposphere.\n",

Recent studies have drawn many conclusions about trends in climate extremes, but few have focused on quantitative analysis of their spatial variability and underlying mechanisms. By using the techniques of overlapping moving windows, the Mann-Kendall trend test, correlation, and stepwise regression, this study examined the spatial-temporal variation of precipitation extremes and investigated the potential key factors influencing this variation in southwestern (SW) China, a globally important biodiversity hot spot and climate-sensitive region. Results showed that the changing trends of precipitation extremes were not spatially uniform, but the spatial variability of these precipitation extremes decreased from 1959 to 2012. Further analysis found that atmospheric circulations rather than local factors (land cover, topographic conditions, etc.) were the main cause of such precipitation extremes. This study suggests that droughts or floods may become more homogenously widespread throughout SW China. Hence, region-wide assessments and coordination are needed to help mitigate the economic and ecological impacts.\n",

        "description": "\n\nPan evaporation is an important indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand, and its long-term variation is of much concern in studies of climate change. Based on data from 33 meteorological stations from 1962 to 2012, this work considered the temporal and spatial trends of pan evaporation and the meteorological variables that affect them in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of southwestern China. Pan evaporation in the TRSR has decreased significantly since 1988 with an obvious abrupt change from 1993 to 2003. Furthermore, a 27\u2009year period of oscillation has existed over the past 51\u2009years. Pan evaporation reflects the combined effects of four meteorological variables: net radiation (Rn), wind speed (u2), actual vapor pressure (ea), and air temperature (Ta). Based on this research, a number of conclusions were drawn. (1) The pace of climate change increased after 1980 and pan evaporation decreased at a rate of \u221213.3\u2009mm/a2 from 1980 to 2012, which is much faster than the rate of \u22121.2\u2009mm/a2 from 1962 to 1979. (2) For the decrease of pan evaporation from 1980 to 2012, the quantifying contributions of Rn, u2, ea, and Ta were \u22128.7, \u22126.4, \u22121.8, and +3.6\u2009mm/a2, respectively. Thus, it was established for the TRSR that \u201cglobal dimming\u201d was the main reason, and \u201cwind stilling\u201d was a close second to global dimming for the decrease in pan evaporation. (3) Different regions of the TRSR are affected differently by the effects of the meteorological variables. Low-elevation regions in the TRSR are more susceptible to the effects of net radiation and wind speed, whereas high-elevation regions are affected more by actual vapor pressure and air temperature.",

The NAO is represented by the leading Empirical Orthogonal Function of sea level pressure anomalies over the Atlantic sector. The difference of upper tropospheric eddy air temperature (T\u2032) between Asia and the North Pacific is used to measure the APO. Results clearly show that the APO and the NAO correlated very well on the interannual time scale, with the positive (negative) phase of the APO corresponding to the strong (weak) NAO. Such a relationship is well supported by the atmospheric dynamic process. When the APO is in the positive phase (characterized by the positive T\u2032 anomaly over Asia and the negative T\u2032 anomaly over the North Pacific in the upper troposphere), the upper tropospheric geopotential height increases over Asia and decreases over the North Pacific. Accordingly, anticyclonic circulation and cyclonic circulation anomalies are introduced, respectively, over Asia and south of the North Pacific, and a zonal teleconnection wave train is excited from Asia to the North Atlantic. As a consequence, an anomalous anticyclonic circulation prevails in the low level of the North Atlantic and an anomalous cyclonic circulation appears to its north, which corresponds to the atmospheric pattern of strong NAO. Further study proposes that the quasi-stationary wave pattern emanating from the western North Pacific region may serve as a bridge for this linkage.\n",

The objective was to assess the relationship between black carbon (BC) coating composition/thickness and absorption. The site was influenced by emissions from local vehicular traffic, wildfires in Quebec, and transboundary fossil fuel combustion emissions in the United States. Mass concentrations of BC and associated nonrefractory coatings were measured using a soot particle\u2013aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), while aerosol absorption and scattering were measured using a photoacoustic soot spectrometer (PASS). Absorption enhancement was investigated both by comparing ambient and thermally denuded PASS absorption data and by relating absorption data to BC mass concentrations measured using the SP-AMS. Minimal absorption enhancement attributable to lensing at 781\u2009nm was observed for BC using both approaches. However, brown carbon was detected when the site was influenced by wildfire emissions originating in Quebec. BC coating to core mass ratios were highest during this period (~7), and while direct absorption by brown carbon resulted in an absorption enhancement at 405\u2009nm (>2.0), no enhancement attributable to lensing at 781\u2009nm was observed. The efficiency of BC coating removal in the denuder decreased substantially when wildfire-related organics were present and may represent an obstacle for future similar studies. These findings indicate that BC absorption enhancement due to lensing is minimal for downtown Toronto, and potentially other urban locations, even when impacted by long-range transport events.",

The two towers were placed in areas with different water depths along a shore-normal line. The depth of water at the tower over the sea averages about 15\u2009m, and the depth of water near the island is about 10\u2009m. The observed maximum 10\u2009min average wind speed at a height of 10\u2009m is about 32\u2009m\u2009s\u22121. Momentum fluxes derived from three methods (eddy covariance, inertial dissipation, and flux profile) are compared. The momentum fluxes derived from the flux profile method are larger (smaller) over the sea (on the island) than those from the other two methods. The relationship between the 10\u2009m drag coefficient and the 10\u2009m wind speed is examined by use of the data obtained by the eddy covariance method. The drag coefficient first decreases with increasing 10\u2009m wind speed when the wind speeds are 5\u201310\u2009m\u2009s\u22121, then increases and reaches a peak value of 0.002 around a wind speed of 18\u2009m\u2009s\u22121. The drag coefficient decreases with increasing 10\u2009m wind speed when 10\u2009m wind speeds are 18\u201327\u2009m\u2009s\u22121. A comparison of the measurements from the two towers shows that the 10\u2009m drag coefficient from the tower in 10\u2009m water depth is about 40% larger than that from the tower in 15\u2009m water depth when the 10\u2009m wind speed is less than 10\u2009m\u2009s\u22121. Above this, the difference in the 10\u2009m drag coefficients of the two towers disappears.\n",

Recent top-down studies based on observations showed CH4 emissions in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) were greater than those expected from population-apportioned bottom-up state inventories. In this study, we quantify CH4 emissions with an advanced mesoscale inverse modeling system at a resolution of 8\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009km, using aircraft measurements in the SoCAB during the 2010 Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change campaign to constrain the inversion. To simulate atmospheric transport, we use the FLEXible PARTicle-Weather Research and Forecasting (FLEXPART-WRF) Lagrangian particle dispersion model driven by three configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model. We determine surface fluxes of CH4 using a Bayesian least squares method in a four-dimensional inversion. Simulated CH4 concentrations with the posterior emission inventory achieve much better correlations with the measurements (R2\u2009=\u20090.7) than using the prior inventory (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Emission Inventory 2005, R2\u2009=\u20090.5). The emission estimates for CH4 in the posterior, 46.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 Mg CH4/h, are consistent with published observation-based estimates. Changes in the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the SoCAB between the prior and posterior inventories are discussed. Missing or underestimated emissions from dairies, the oil/gas system, and landfills in the SoCAB seem to explain the differences between the prior and posterior inventories. We estimate that dairies contributed 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 Mg CH4/h and the two sectors of oil and gas industries (production and downstream) and landfills together contributed 39.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1 Mg CH4/h in the SoCAB.\n",

In this study, the long-term wind velocity data observed with the Poker Flat MF radar (65\u2218N, 147\u2218W) were analyzed for the period of 1999\u20132008 to show local time dependence and seasonal climatologies of the 12\u2009h and 24\u2009h components in the mesospheric winds and their modulations of gravity wave kinetic energy. We made climatological 1\u2009day composite plots of the kinetic energy of gravity waves for wave periods of 1\u20134\u2009h and harmonic components of horizontal wind for each month. The results show that the kinetic energy of gravity waves peaks twice at 3\u20136 LT and 18\u201321 LT, which tend to coincide with the transition of the 12\u2009h component of zonal wind from westward to eastward flow. On the other hand, a 2\u2009month case study revealed that the gravity wave kinetic energy and the 12\u2009h components of zonal wind appear to keep their phase difference constant (like a \u201cphase locked\u201d) for more than 10\u2009days. Events of this kind are also found in other years. To examine whether this relation can be explained by interaction between the 12\u2009h component of zonal wind and gravity waves, we applied a gravity wave drag model to the background state defined as the sum of observed monthly mean and harmonic components of zonal wind. It is suggested that the orographic gravity wave drag has a 12\u2009h periodicity and that the time of the drag enhancement changes in time following change in the phase of harmonic components of winds.\n",

Many isotope-based studies are aimed at understanding ENSO variability in the tropics, however, focusing principally on near-surface processes and isotopologue signals. The goal of the present study is to investigate the atmospheric processes governing the changes in the isotopic composition of water vapor both near the surface and at midtroposphere in the Pacific region during ENSO events, using a combination of remote sensing data and model simulations. For the lower atmosphere (i.e., 1000\u2009hPa), our results show that rainout processes, less rain reevaporation of falling droplets, and increase of convective updrafts and diffusive exchange within the convective systems contribute to \u201cthe isotope amount effect\u201d and isotopically deplete the water vapor during wet conditions, in agreement with previous studies. However, we find that the ENSO-associated isotopic signal in the midtroposphere (i.e., 500\u2009hPa) diverges from the near-surface response. Analysis suggests that transport of enriched water vapor from lower atmospheric layers through convective updrafts controls the enrichment of midtropospheric water vapor over the Pacific Ocean. In the observations, a strong positive correlation between the increase of convective precipitation and the isotopic composition of water vapor clearly points to such a mechanism (R of 0.7\u20130.8 in the Central Pacific and 0.5\u20130.6 in the West Pacific). Model results confirm this mechanisms though producing slightly lower correlation values, with R values of 0.6 in the Central Pacific and 0.5 in the West Pacific. However, the distinction between convective and stratiform precipitation remains a result of model-dependent parameterization. Our analysis suggests that two issues should be investigated in more detail in further studies: (1) the equilibrium and disequilibrium between rain droplets and surrounding vapor for convective and stratiform precipitation and (2) different convection schemes in the different isotopic general circulation models (GCMs) describing the triggering of convection and uplift of lower layer air to higher layers. Ideally, such a comparison of different isotopic GCMs can provide us with an interesting benchmark test for the performance of the different convection schemes during ENSO and can help to disentangle the importance of the different processes contributing to the amount effect.\n",

The storm database is drawn from four regions of the United States featuring distinct environments, each with coinciding Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) network data. LMAs are able to infer total lightning flash rates using flash clustering algorithms, such as the one implemented in this study. Results show that anomalous charge structures inferred from LMA data, significant lightning flash rates, and increased radar reflectivities above the freezing level tend to be associated with environments that have high cloud base heights (approximately 3\u2009km above ground level) and large atmospheric instability, quantified by normalized convective available potential energy (NCAPE) near 0.2\u2009m\u2009s\u22122. Additionally, we infer that aerosols may affect storm intensity. Maximum flash rates were observed in storms with attributed aerosol concentrations near 1000\u2009cm\u22123, while total flash rates decrease when aerosol concentrations exceed 1500\u2009cm\u22123, consistent with previous studies. However, this effect is more pronounced in regions where the NCAPE and cloud base height are low. The dearth of storms with estimated aerosol concentrations less than 700\u2009cm\u22123 (approximately 1% of total sample) does not provide a complete depiction of aerosol invigoration.\n",

        "description": "\n\nUnderstanding critical processes that contribute to the organization of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is important for accurate weather forecasts and climate predictions. In this study, we investigate the effects of wind shear at different vertical levels on the organization and properties of convective systems using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with spectral bin microphysics. Based on a control run for a MCS with weak wind shear (Ctrl), we find that increasing wind shear at the lower troposphere (L-shear) leads to a more organized quasi-line convective system. Strong wind shear in the middle troposphere (M-shear) tends to produce large vorticity and form a mesocyclone circulation and an isolated strong storm that leans toward supercellular structure. By increasing wind shear at the upper vertical levels only (U-shear), the organization of the convection is not changed much, but the convective intensity is weakened. Increasing wind shear in the middle troposphere for the selected case results in a significant drying, and the drying is more significant when conserving moisture advection at the lateral boundaries, contributing to the suppressed convective strength and precipitation relative to Ctrl. Precipitation in the L-shear and U-shear does not change much from Ctrl. Evident changes of cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties in the strong wind shear cases are mainly due to large changes in convective organization and water vapor. The insights obtained from this study help us better understand the major factors contributing to convective organization and precipitation.\n",

Using satellite data, we showed that cold (warm) eddies cause surface winds to decelerate (accelerate) and reduce (increase) latent and sensible heat fluxes, cloud liquid water, water vapor content, and rain rate; all of these changes are quantified. Both the linear correlation between wind divergence and downwind sea surface temperature (SST) gradient and the correspondence between vorticity and crosswind SST gradient support the vertical momentum mixing mechanism, which indicates that SST perturbations modify surface winds by changing the vertical turbulent mixing in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). High-resolution National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data can reproduce the atmospheric responses to the oceanic eddies in the MABL albeit with some differences in intensity. In addition, the CFSR data reveal that the atmospheric responses to these oceanic eddies are not confined in the MABL. MABL deepens (shoals) over the warm (cold) eddies; enhanced (reduced) vertical transport of transient zonal momentum occurs over the warm (cold) eddies from the sea surface to about 850\u2009hPa level; vertical velocity anomalies over oceanic eddies penetrate beyond the MABL into free atmosphere; there exists a positive correlated relationship between SST and convective rain rate anomalies, indicative of ocean eddies' impact on the free troposphere. However, the composites of cloud liquid water and rain rate are different from the results based on the satellite data.\n",

The lightning channel is represented as a transmission line including corona and nonlinear losses. Analyses for the hypothetical case of a lossless channel considering matched tower and channel impedances show that the arrival of current pulses at the upward moving return-stroke front leads to an increase in corona currents leaving the channel. This transient process generates current pulses whose arrival at the tower top can be interpreted as the effect of a current reflection at the upward moving front, even though no impedance discontinuity exists at that point if return-stroke and leader channel properties are assumed the same. In the more realistic case of a lossy channel considering unmatched channel and tower impedances, the nonlinear channel resistance modifies the current pulses that propagate along the channel so that they merge smoothly with the return-stroke front. In this case, the interaction of the current pulses transmitted from the tower to the channel with the upward moving return-stroke front does not lead to features that can be clearly interpreted as the result of current reflections at that point in the evaluated conditions. Finally, it is argued that the current reflection coefficient at the tower top should be viewed as a current dependent parameter as opposed to a constant, linear value.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe impact of size distribution of mineral dust aerosol on radiative transfer was investigated using the Aerosol Robotic Network-retrieved aerosol size distributions. Three methods for determining the aerosol optical properties using size distributions were discussed. The first is referred to as a bin method in which the aerosol optical properties are determined for each bin of the size distribution. The second is named as an assembly mean method in which the aerosol optical properties are determined with an integration of the aerosol optical parameters over the observed size distribution. The third is a normal parameterization method based on an assumed size distribution. The bin method was used to generate the benchmark results in the radiation calculations against the methods of the assembly mean, and parameterizations based on two size distribution functions, namely, lognormal and gamma were examined. It is seen that the assembly mean method can produce aerosol radiative forcing with accuracy of better than 1%. The accuracies of the parameterizations based on lognormal and gamma size distributions are about 25% and 5%, respectively. Both the lognormal and gamma size distributions can be determined by two parameters, the effective radius and effective variance. The better results from the gamma size distribution can be explained by a third parameter of skewness which is found to be useful for judging how close the assumed distribution is to the observation result. The parameterizations based on the two assumed size distributions are also evaluated in a climate model. The results show that the reflected solar fluxes over the desert areas determined by the scheme based on the gamma size distribution are about 1\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 less than those from the scheme based on the lognormal size distribution, bringing the model results closer to the observations.\n",

Our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial Africa, South Asia, and the Amazon basin between June 2006 and June 2008. We identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport by region and stage of convective development. The most extensive UT ALs over equatorial Africa are associated with mature MCSs, while the most extensive UT ALs over South Asia and the Amazon are associated with growing MCSs. Convective aerosol transport over the Amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of MCSs over the Amazon. Variations in UT ALs in the vicinity of tropical MCSs are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated MCSs and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. We also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of MCS development. Relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport are relatively weak during the decaying stage of convective development. Our results provide an interpretive framework for devising and evaluating numerical model experiments that examine relationships between convective properties and ALs in the upper troposphere.\n",

Using the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research-United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols chemistry-climate model, we compare reference runs that include forcing due to greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances to sensitivity simulations in which ozone-depleting substances are fixed at their 1960 levels. We find that ozone depletion leads to an increased frequency of extreme anomalies and increased persistence of the SAM in the stratosphere as well as stronger, more persistent stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Currently, the stratosphere provides an appreciable amount of predictability to the troposphere on timescales of 1 or 2\u2009months; however, we find that this effect reduces over time as stratospheric ozone recovers to preozone hole levels toward the latter part of this century.\n",

        "description": "\nThe sensitivity of climate to the loss of the Congo basin rainforest through changes in land cover properties is examined using a regional climate model. The complete removal of the Congo basin rainforest results in a dipole rainfall anomaly pattern, characterized by a decrease (\u223c\u221242%) in rainfall over the western Congo and an increase (\u223c10%) in the basin's eastern part. Three further experiments systematically examine the individual response to the changes in albedo, surface roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency that accompany deforestation. The increased albedo (\u223c) caused by the Congo basin rainforest clearance results in cooler and drier climate conditions over the entire basin. The drying is accompanied with a reduction in available surface energy. Reducing evapotranspiration efficiency or roughness length produces similar positive air temperature anomaly patterns. The decreased evapotranspiration efficiency leads to a dipole response in rainfall, similar to that resulting from a reduced surface roughness following Congo basin rainforest clearance. This precipitation anomaly pattern is strongly linked to the change in low-level water vapor transport, the influence of the Rift valley highlands, and the spatial pattern of water recycling activity. The climate responds linearly to the separate albedo, surface roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency changes, which can be summed to produce a close approximation to the impact of the full deforestation experiment. It is suggested that the widely contrasting climate responses to deforestation in the literature could be partly due to the relative magnitude of change of the radiative and nonradiative parameterizations in their respective land surface schemes.",

The simulations integrate a new satellite data set for urban extent and a geolocated crowd-sourced data set for road surface area and consider differences only in urban land cover and its physical properties. The simulations account for changes in meteorologically driven natural emissions but do not include changes in anthropogenic emissions resulting from urbanization and road network variations. The astounding urbanization, which quadrupled Beijing urban extent between 2000 and 2009 in terms of physical infrastructure change, created a ring of impact that decreased surface albedo, increased ground and near-surface air temperatures, increased vertical turbulent kinetic energy, and decreased the near-surface relative humidity and wind speed. The meteorological changes alone decreased near-surface particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and many other chemicals due to vertical dilution but increased near-surface ozone due to the higher temperature and lower NO. Vertical dilution and wind stagnation increased elevated pollution layers and column aerosol extinction. In sum, the ring of impact around Beijing may have increased urban heating, dried soil, mixed pollutants vertically, aggravated air stagnation, and increased near-surface oxidant pollution even before accounting for changes in anthropogenic emissions.",

The calibrated data set documents seasonal variations in the relationship between \u03b418O and local humidity (ppmv) and between deuterium excess and \u03b418O. These seasonal variations are attributed to seasonal changes in atmospheric transport. A strong linear relationship is observed between deuterium excess and atmospheric relative humidity calculated at regional sea surface temperature. Surprisingly, we find a similar relationship between deuterium excess and relative humidity as observed in the Bermuda Islands. During days with low amount of isotopic depletion (more enriched values), our data significantly deviate from the global meteoric water line. This feature can be explained by a supply of an evaporative flux into the planetary boundary layer above the ocean, which we show using a 1-d box model. Based on the close relationship identified between moisture origin and deuterium excess, we combine deuterium excess measurements performed in Iceland and south Greenland with moisture source diagnostics based on back trajectory calculations to establish the distribution of d-excess moisture uptake values across the North Atlantic. We map high deuterium excess in the Arctic and low deuterium excess for vapor in the subtropics and midlatitudes. This confirms the role of North Atlantic water vapor isotopes as moisture origin tracers.",

As the Sun brightens due to stellar evolution, Earth will become uninhabitable due to rising temperatures. Here we use a modified version of the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study Earth under intense solar radiation. For small (\u226410%) increases in the solar constant (S0), Earth warms nearly linearly with climate sensitivities of ~1\u2009K/(W\u2009m\u22122) and global mean surface temperatures below 310\u2009K. However, an abrupt shift in climate is found as the solar constant is increased to +12.5% S0. Here climate sensitivity peaks at ~6.5\u2009K/(W\u2009m\u22122), while global mean surface temperatures rise above 330\u2009K. This climatic transition is associated with a fundamental change to the radiative-convective state of the atmosphere. Hot, moist climates feature both strong solar absorption and inefficient radiative cooling in the low atmosphere, thus yielding net radiative heating of the near-surface layers. This heating forms an inversion that effectively shuts off convection in the boundary layer. Beyond the transition, Earth continues to warm but with climate sensitivities again near unity. Conditions conducive to significant water loss to space are not found until +19% S0. Earth remains stable against a thermal runaway up to at least +21% S0, but at that point, global mean surface temperatures exceed 360\u2009K, and water loss to space becomes rapid. Water loss of the oceans from a moist greenhouse may preclude a thermal runaway.",

Both CESM and CMIP5 ensembles can reproduce the observed temporal and spatial variability of aridity. On the interannual time scale, annual average PET is sensitive to the variability of relative humidity, net surface energy flux, and surface air temperature, while the precipitation variability is the dominant component of annual average aridity sensitivity. For the long-term trends, differences between the two ensembles illustrate that the impact of the internal variability is smaller than that of the model structural uncertainty with the trends from the CMIP5 ensemble of models having a much larger spread than those from the single-model CESM-LE. The annual mean aridity averaged over global land increases (becomes drier) by 6.4% in 2055\u20132080 relative to 1980\u20132005. Aridity trends differ by region in the ensemble mean. In the future, increasing precipitation leads to decreasing aridity over northwest China and central (or tropical) Africa, while decreasing precipitation leads to drying (increasing aridity) in the subtropics, northern and southern Africa, and the Amazon.

This study uses a number of satellite-derived data sets to evaluate how well the current generation of climate models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulate the seasonal cycle of climatological snow cover fraction (SCF) and surface albedo over the Northern Hemisphere snow season (September\u2013June). Using a variety of metrics, the CMIP5 models are found to simulate SCF evolution better than that of albedo. The seasonal cycle of SCF is well reproduced despite substantial biases in simulated surface albedo of snow-covered land (\u03b1sfc_snow), which affect both the magnitude and timing of the seasonal peak in \u03b1sfc_snow during the fall snow accumulation period, and the springtime snow ablation period. Insolation weighting demonstrates that the biases in \u03b1sfc_snow during spring are of greater importance for the surface energy budget. Albedo biases are largest across the boreal forest, where the simulated seasonal cycle of albedo is biased high in 15/16 CMIP5 models. This bias is explained primarily by unrealistic treatment of vegetation masking and subsequent overestimation (more than 50% in some cases) of peak \u03b1sfc_snow rather than by biases in SCF. While seemingly straightforward corrections to peak \u03b1sfc_snow could yield significant improvements to simulated snow albedo feedback, changes in \u03b1sfc_snow could potentially introduce biases in other important model variables such as surface temperature.",

Accurate EASM rainfall prediction necessitates robust paleoclimate reconstructions from proxy data and quantitative linkage to modern climatic conditions. Many precisely dated oxygen isotope records from Chinese stalagmites have been interpreted as directly reflecting past EASM rainfall amount variability, but recent research suggests that such records instead integrate multiple hydroclimatic processes. Using a Lagrangian precipitation moisture source diagnostic, we demonstrate that EASM rainfall is primarily derived from the Indian Ocean. Conversely, Pacific Ocean moisture export peaks during winter, and the moisture uptake area does not differ significantly between summer and winter and is thus a minor contributor to monsoonal precipitation. Our results are substantiated by an accurate reproduction of summer and winter spatial rainfall distributions across China. We also correlate modern EASM rainfall oxygen isotope ratios with instrumental rainfall amount and our moisture source data. This analysis reveals that the strength of the source effect is geographically variable, and differences in atmospheric moisture transport may significantly impact the isotopic signature of EASM rainfall at the Hulu, Dongge, and Wanxiang Cave sites. These results improve our ability to isolate the rainfall amount signal in paleomonsoon reconstructions and indicate that precipitation across central and eastern China will directly respond to variability in Indian Ocean moisture supply.",

In northern Tropics, the largest intraseasonal variability of SST during boreal winter is found in the SCS, with two localized regions of large standard deviation, one extending westward from the Luzon Strait and the other extending southward from the coast of central Vietnam. Correspondingly, large intraseasonal variability in surface heat fluxes is observed in the above regions. Analysis shows that the formation of large intraseasonal SST anomalies in these regions is attributed largely to wind-related surface latent heat flux changes, with supplementary contribution from cloud-related surface shortwave radiation changes. Wind-induced Ekman advection has a negative effect, and the Ekman upwelling pattern differs from the intraseasonal SST anomaly pattern. The intraseasonal variations of SST in the SCS display a close association with the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) change with a time lag of 3\u20135\u2009days. In a weak (strong) phase of the EAWM, decrease (increase) in surface wind speed and suppression (enhancement) in surface latent heat flux lead to intraseasonal SST warming (cooling). This intraseasonal SST signal displays a southward propagation with the SST change in northern SCS leading that in southern SCS by about 2\u2009days. A similar southward propagation is seen in surface wind speed and latent heat flux anomalies. The southward propagation of cloud and shortwave radiation anomalies is limited to northern part of the SCS.",

The tornadic vortex was observed on 10 December 2012 by the high-resolution in situ observational linear array of wind and pressure sensors (LAWPS) system in conjunction with a high-resolution Doppler radar. The 0.1\u2009s maximum wind speed and pressure deficit near the ground were recorded as 35.3\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 and \u22123.8\u2009hPa, respectively. The horizontal two-dimensional distributions of the tornadic vortex wind and pressure were retrieved by the LAWPS data, which provided unprecedented observational detail on the following important features of the near-surface structure of the tornadic vortex. Asymmetric convergent inflow toward the vortex center existed. Total wind speed was strong to the right and rear side of the translational direction of the vortex and weak in the forward part of the vortex possibly because of the strong convergent inflow in that region. The tangential wind speed profile of the vortex was better approximated using a modified Rankine vortex rather than the Rankine vortex both at 5\u2009m\u2009above ground level (agl) and 100\u2009m\u2009agl, and other vortex models (Burgers-Rott vortex and Wood-White vortex) were also compared. The cyclostrophic wind balance was violated in the core radius R0 and outside the core radius in the forward sector; however, it was held with a relatively high accuracy of approximately 14% outside the core of the vortex in the rearward sector (from 2\u2009R0 to 5\u2009R0) near the ground.",

To enhance understanding of the haze occurrences, this study examined the haze variations over North China and their associated atmospheric circulations for the period of 1960\u20132012 using daily visibility data. Results indicate that the haze events over this region primarily occur in boreal winter of year and mainly in the morning of day. The results of the analysis of the long-term variations indicate that the annual haze days were relatively few in the 1960s but increased steeply in the 1970s and have remained stable to the present. Some differences are obvious among seasons. A stably increasing trend is discernable in summer and autumn, relatively low in the 1960s and the 1990s\u20132000s and relatively high in the 1970s\u20131980s in spring and winter. Haze variations in urban regions are quite similar to haze variations in rural regions but with more haze days in urban regions because of the high aerosol emissions. Further analyses indicate that the occurrences of severe haze events in boreal winter generally correlate with the weakened northerly winds and the development of inversion anomalies in the lower troposphere, the weakened East Asian trough in the midtroposphere, and the northward East Asian jet in the high troposphere. All of these factors provide a favorable atmospheric background for the maintenance and development of haze events in this region.",

We develop a new LDAS that can improve the skill of an ecohydrological model to simulate simultaneously surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics by assimilating passive microwave observations that are sensitive to both surface soil moisture and terrestrial biomass. This LDAS first calibrates both hydrological and ecological parameters of a land surface model, which explicitly simulates vegetation growth and senescence. Then, it adjusts the model states of soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) sequentially using a genetic particle filter. We can adjust the subsurface soil moisture, which is not observed directly by satellites, because we simulate the interactions between vegetation dynamics and subsurface water dynamics. From a point-scale evaluation, we succeed in improving the performance of our land surface model and generate ensembles of the model state whose distribution reflects the combined information in the land surface model and satellite observations. We show that the adjustment of the subsurface soil moisture significantly improves the capacity to simulate vegetation dynamics in seasonal forecast timescales. This LDAS can contribute to the generation of ensemble initial conditions of surface and subsurface soil moisture and LAI for a probabilistic framework of weather and seasonal forecasting.",

Interactions between propagating waves of different scales are likely to be numerous and important. We find that a static medium-scale wave wind field of sufficient amplitude can channel and/or critical-level filter a small-scale wave or cause significant reflection, depending upon both waves' parameters. However, the inclusion of a time-dependent phase progression of the medium-scale wave can reduce energy loss through critical-level filtering by up to \u223c70% and can also reduce reflection by up to \u223c60% for the cases simulated. We also find that the relative direction of propagation between the small-scale and medium-scale wave can significantly affect small-scale wave filtering. When the phases are progressing in the same horizontal direction, the small-scale wave is far more likely to become trapped and ultimately critical-level filtered than if the phases are propagating in opposite horizontal directions unless reflection occurs first. Considerations of time-dependent winds associated with medium-scale-propagating waves and their directionality are important for assessing the propagation and dispersion of small-scale waves over large horizontal distances.",

However, how and to what extent precipitation deficits affect surface air temperatures is still poorly understood. In this study, the relationship between precipitation deficits and surface temperatures was examined in China from 1960 to 2012 based on monthly temperature and precipitation records from 565 stations. Significant negative correlations were identified in each season, with the strongest relationships in the summer, indicating that higher temperatures usually accompanied water-deficient conditions and lower temperatures usually accompanied wet conditions. The examination of the correlations based on 30\u2009year moving windows suggested that the interaction between the two variables has declined over the past three decades. Further investigation indicated a higher impact of extreme dry conditions on temperature than that of extreme wet conditions. In addition, a new simple index (Dry Temperature Index, DTI) was developed and used to quantitatively describe the relationship between water deficits and air temperature variations. We tested and compared the DTI in the coldest month (January) and the hottest month (July) of the year, station by station. In both months, the number of stations with a DThighI\u2009\u2265\u200950% was greater than those with a DThighI\u2009<\u200950%, indicating that a greater proportion of higher temperatures occurred during dry conditions.

Three 60 h case study periods span the temporal evolution of cumulus, stratiform, and drizzling boundary layer cloud systems, representing mixed and transitional states rather than idealized or canonical cases. Based on in situ measurements from the Routine AAF (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerial Facility) CLOWD (Clouds with Low Optical Water Depth) Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO) field campaign and remote sensing observations, the cases are designed with a modular configuration to simplify use in large-eddy simulations (LES) and single-column models. Aircraft measurements of aerosol number size distribution are fit to lognormal functions for concise representation in models. Values of the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, \u03ba, are derived from observations to be ~0.10, which are lower than the 0.3 typical over continents and suggestive of a large aerosol organic fraction. Ensemble large-scale forcing data sets are derived from the ARM variational analysis, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and a multiscale data assimilation system. The forcings are assessed through comparison of measured bulk atmospheric and cloud properties to those computed in \u201ctrial\u201d large-eddy simulations, where more efficient run times are enabled through modest reductions in grid resolution and domain size compared to the full-sized LES grid. Simulations capture many of the general features observed, but the state-of-the-art forcings were limited at representing details of cloud onset, and tight gradients and high-resolution transients of importance. Methods for improving the initial conditions and forcings are discussed. The cases developed are available to the general modeling community for studying continental boundary clouds.",

We compare simulated cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties with ground-based remote sensing and aircraft observations. The LES simulations capture the observed transitions of the evolving cumulus-topped boundary layers during the three daytime periods and generally reproduce variations of droplet number concentration with liquid water content (LWC), corresponding to the gradient between the cloud centers and cloud edges at given heights. The observed LWC values fall within the range of simulated values; the observed droplet number concentrations are commonly higher than simulated, but differences remain on par with potential estimation errors in the aircraft measurements. Sensitivity studies examine the influences of bin microphysics versus bulk microphysics, aerosol advection, supersaturation treatment, and aerosol hygroscopicity. Simulated macrophysical cloud properties are found to be insensitive in this nonprecipitating case, but microphysical properties are especially sensitive to bulk microphysics supersaturation treatment and aerosol hygroscopicity.",

The FAst-physics System TEstbed and Research (FASTER) Project has constructed case studies from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility's Southern Great Plain site during the RACORO aircraft campaign to facilitate research on model representation of boundary-layer clouds. This paper focuses on using the single-column Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (SCAM5) simulations of a multi-day continental shallow cumulus case to identify specific parameterization causes of low-cloud biases. Consistent model biases among the simulations driven by a set of alternative forcings suggest that uncertainty in the forcing plays only a relatively minor role. In-depth analysis reveals that the model's shallow cumulus convection scheme tends to significantly under-produce clouds during the times when shallow cumuli exist in the observations, while the deep convective and stratiform cloud schemes significantly over-produce low-level clouds throughout the day. The links between model biases and the underlying assumptions of the shallow cumulus scheme are further diagnosed with the aid of large-eddy simulations and aircraft measurements, and by suppressing the triggering of the deep convection scheme. It is found that the weak boundary layer turbulence simulated is directly responsible for the weak cumulus activity and the simulated boundary layer stratiform clouds. Increased vertical and temporal resolutions are shown to lead to stronger boundary layer turbulence and reduction of low-cloud biases.",

Until recently, no in situ observations have been available to investigate links between microphysical snowfall properties and their scattering properties. In this study, we investigate for the first time relations between collocated ground-based triple-frequency observations with in situ measurements of snowfall at the ground. The three analyzed snowfall cases obtained during a recent field campaign in Finland cover light to moderate snowfall rates with transitions from heavily rimed snow to open-structured, low-density snowflakes. The observed triple-frequency signatures agree well with the previously published findings from airborne radar observations. A rich spatiotemporal structure of triple-frequency observations throughout the cloud is observed during the three cases, which often seems to be related to riming and aggregation zones within the cloud. The comparison of triple-frequency signatures from the lowest altitudes with the ground-based in situ measurements reveals that in the presence of large (>5\u2009mm) snow aggregates, a bending away in the triple-frequency space from the curve of classical spheroid scattering models is always observed. Rimed particles appear along an almost horizontal line in the triple-frequency space, which was not observed before. Overall, the three case studies indicate a close connection of triple-frequency signatures and snow particle structure, bulk snowfall density, and characteristic size of the particle size distribution.",

The storm was observed on 22 February 2012 as part of the AgI (silver iodide) Seeding Cloud Impact Investigation experiment in Wyoming. The cloud base (top) temperature was about \u22125\u00b0C (\u221212\u00b0C). Vertical velocity data from an airborne Doppler W-band (3\u2009mm) profiling Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) indicate broad ascent due to the strong wind (20\u2009m\u2009s-1) impinging on the terrain and small pockets of intense updrafts. The large droplets, low droplet and ice particle concentrations, and strong updrafts lead to natural snow growth mainly by accretion (riming). The treated (seeded) period is compared with the preceding untreated period. The main target site, located on a mountain pass, was impacted by AgI seeding, according to a trace chemistry analysis of the falling snow. Data from three radar systems were used in the analysis of the impact of seeding on snow growth: the WCR, two Ka-band (1.2\u2009cm) profiling Micro Rain Radars , and an X-band (3\u2009cm) scanning polarization Doppler-on-Wheels radar. This case is complicated somewhat by a natural increase in cloud liquid water and in snow growth by riming, starting halfway during the seeding period, and continuing after seeding ended. Composite data from the centimeter-wave radar systems indicate an increase in low-level reflectivity during seeding, even after accounting for the natural trend observed in the upwind control region. A precipitation particle probe at the main target site shows an increase in concentration of both small and large hydrometeors.",

A field survey was conducted to acquire snow spectral reflectance measurements with an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Field Spec Pro spectroradiometer. Surface snow samples were analyzed to determine the concentration and size distribution of MD in each sample. An overflight of a four-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB digital camera sensor was carried out during the field operations. Finally, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data covering the central European Alps were analyzed. Observed reflectance evidenced that MD strongly reduced the spectral reflectance of snow, in particular, from 350 to 600\u2009nm. Reflectance was compared with that simulated by parameterizing the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation radiative transfer model. We defined a novel spectral index, the Snow Darkening Index (SDI), that combines different wavelengths showing nonlinear correlation with measured MD concentrations (R2\u2009=\u20090.87, root-mean-square error\u2009=\u20090.037). We also estimated a positive instantaneous radiative forcing that reaches values up to 153\u2009W/m2 for the most concentrated sampling area. SDI maps at local scale were produced using the UAV data, while regional SDI maps were generated with OLI data. These maps show the spatial distribution of MD in snow after a natural deposition from the Saharan desert. Such postdepositional experimental data are fundamental for validating radiative transfer models and global climate models that simulate the impact of MD on snow radiative properties.",

Aerosols can cause transitions between regimes of fully cloudy closed cells and open cells. The possible role of aerosols in cloud cover has a big impact on the amount of reflected solar radiation from the clouds, thus potentially constitutes very large aerosol indirect radiative effect, which can exceed 100\u2009Wm\u22122. It is hypothesized that continentally polluted clouds remain in closed cells regime for longer time from leaving continent and hence for longer distance away from land, thus occupying larger ocean areas with full cloud cover. Attributing this to anthropogenic aerosols would imply a very large negative radiative forcing with a significant climate impact. This possibility is confirmed by analyzing a detailed case study based on geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite observations of the microphysical and dynamical evolution of MSC. We show that large area of closed cells was formed over the northeast Atlantic Ocean downwind of Europe in a continentally polluted air mass. The closed cells undergo cleansing process that was tracked for 3.5\u2009days that resulted with a rapid transition from closed to open cells once the clouds started drizzling heavily. The mechanism leading to the eventual breakup of the clouds due to both meteorological and aerosol considerations is elucidated. We termed this cleansing and cloud breakup process maritimization.

In June 2011, a comprehensive data set of ground-based and airborne in situ measurements and remote sensing observations was acquired within the Fennec/Lagrangian Dust Source Inversion Experiment (LADUNEX) field campaign in the western Sahara region. Here we evaluate the ability of the state-of-the-art Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, newly fitted with a dust mobilization capability, to simulate dust transport in this region. We investigate a case where a large mesoscale convective system (MCS) triggered dust emissions in central Mali, which subsequently moved as a large cold pool dust front toward northern Mauritania. Specifying dust mobilization for this case is shown to be an important obstacle to simulating dust transport during this event, since neither the MCS nor the associated cold pool-causing dust emission is represented in the meteorological analysis. Obtaining a realistic dust transport simulation for this case therefore requires an inversion approach using a manual specification of the dust sources supported by satellite imagery. When compared to in situ and remote sensing data from two aircraft, the Lagrangian dust transport simulations represent the overall shape and evolution of the dust plume well. While accumulation and coarse mode dust are well represented in the simulation, giant mode particles are considerably underestimated. Our results re-emphasize that dust emission associated with deep moist convection remains a key issue for reliable dust model simulations in northern Africa.",

A three-layer plane-parallel atmosphere model is used in conjunction with a simplified radiative transfer (RT) scheme to illustrate the combined effects of dichroic and nondichroic media on microwave signatures observed by ground-based and spaceborne sensors. Based on idealized scenarios which encompass a dichroic snow layer and adjacent nondichroic layers composed of supercooled liquid water (SCLW) droplets and water vapor, we demonstrate that the presence of atmospheric absorption/emission enhances TB and damps PD when observed from the ground. From a spaceborne perspective, however, TB can be reduced or enhanced by an absorbing/emitting layer above the snow layer, while a strong absorbing/emitting layer below the dichroic snow layer may even enhance PD. The induced PD and TB, which rely on snow microphysical assumptions, can vary up to 2\u2009K and 10\u2009K, respectively, due to the temperature-dependent absorption of SCLW. RT calculations based on 223 snowfall profiles selected from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data sets indicate that the existence of SCLW has a noticeable impact on PD and TB at three window frequencies (150\u2009GHz, 243\u2009GHz, and 664\u2009GHz) during snowfall. Our results imply that while polarimetric channels at the three window channels have the potential for snowfall characterization, accurate information on liquid water is required to correctly interpret the polarimetric observations.",

Daily radar derived cloud fraction profiles peak at different height levels depending on the depth of the cumuli and thus the extent to which they precipitate. Nonprecipitating cumuli have a peak cloud fraction of about 5% near mean cloud base (700\u2009m), whereas precipitating cumuli tend to have a peak of only 2% near cloud base. Nineteen percent of the precipitating cumuli are accompanied by large cloud fractions near the detrainment level of cumulus tops (~1700\u2009m). Day-to-day variations in cloud fraction near cloud base are modest (~3%). Nonprecipitating cumuli have their largest reflectivities near cloud top and an ascending core surrounded by a subsiding shell. Precipitating cumuli with enhanced elevated cloudiness (stratiform outflow) are deeper and contain larger vertical gradients in reflectivity and Doppler velocity than precipitating cumuli without such outflow. Bulk (3\u2009h) statistics reveal that nonprecipitating shallow cumuli are active and organized. They contain on average 79% in-cloud updrafts with 86% of them being organized in large coherent structures contributing to a maximum updraft mass flux of 8\u201336\u2009gm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 just above cloud base. Alternatively, downdrafts contribute insignificantly to the mass flux and show little vertical and temporal variability (0\u20137\u2009gm\u22122\u2009s\u22121).

Thresholds of liquid water potential temperature difference \u0394\u03b8L\u2009<\u20090.5\u2009K (>0.5\u2009K) and total water mixing ratio difference \u0394qt\u2009<\u20090.5\u2009g/kg (>0.5\u2009g/kg) below the cloud base were used for selecting the coupled (decoupled) cases. A schematic diagram was given to demonstrate the coupled and decoupled MBL vertical structures and how they associate with nondrizzle, virga, and rain drizzle events. Out of a total of 2676 5\u2009min samples, 34.5% were classified as coupled and 65.5% as decoupled, 36.2% as nondrizzle and 63.8% as drizzle (47.7% as virga and 16.1% as rain), and 33.4% as daytime and 66.6% as nighttime. The decoupled cloud layer is deeper (0.406\u2009km) than coupled cloud layer (0.304\u2009km), and its liquid water path and cloud droplet effective radius (re) values (122.1\u2009gm\u22122 and 13.0\u2009\u00b5m) are higher than coupled ones (83.7\u2009gm\u22122 and 10.4\u2009\u00b5m). Conversely, decoupled stratocumuli have lower cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and surface cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) concentration (NCCN) (74.5\u2009cm\u22123 and 150.9\u2009cm\u22123) than coupled stratocumuli (111.7\u2009cm\u22123 and 216.4\u2009cm\u22123). The linear regressions between re and Nd with NCCN have demonstrated that coupled re and Nd strongly depend on NCCN and have higher correlations (\u22120.56 and 0.59) with NCCN than decoupled results (\u22120.14 and 0.25). The MBL cloud properties under nondrizzle and virga drizzle conditions are similar to each other but significantly different to those of rain drizzle.",

        "description": "\nReconstruction of unknown atmospheric releases using measured concentrations is an ill-posed inverse problem. Due to insufficient measurements and dispersion model uncertainties, reliable interpretation of a retrieved source is limited by lack of resolution, nonuniqueness, and instability in the inverse solution. The study presents an optimality analysis, in terms of resolution, stability, and reliability, of an inverse solution given by a recently proposed inversion technique, called as renormalization. The inversion technique is based on an adjoint source-receptor framework and construction of a weight function which interprets a priori information about the unknown release apparent to the monitoring network. The properties of weight function provide a perfect data resolution, maximum model resolution, and minimum variance (or stability) for the retrieved source. The reliability of the retrieved source is interpreted in view of the information derived from the geometry of the monitoring network. The inversion technique and resolution features are evaluated for a point source reconstruction using measurements from a recent dispersion experiment (Fusion Field Trials 2007) conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. With the real measurements, the point release is reconstructed within an average distance of 23\u2009m from the true release where the average distance of the nearest receptor from the true source was 32\u2009m. In all the trials, the point release is retrieved within 3\u201360\u2009m Euclidean distance from their true location. The source strength is retrieved within a factor of 1.5 to the true release mass. The posterior uncertainty in the release parameters is observed to be within 20% of their mean value. The source localization features are resolved to its maximum extent feasible with the design of the monitoring network. The sensitivity studies are conducted to highlight the importance of receptors reporting zero concentration measurements and variations in the resolution features of the source retrieval with respect to the various arrangements of the receptors.",

        "description": "\n\nConvective features (CFs) observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite between 2004 and 2011 are analyzed to determine the relative roles of thermodynamics and aerosols as they modulate radar reflectivity and lightning. We studied the simultaneous impacts of normalized convective available potential energy (NCAPE) and warm cloud depth (WCD) as well as cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (D\u2009\u2265\u200940\u2009nm; N40) on total lightning density (TLD), average height of 30\u2009dBZ echoes (AVGHT30), and vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) within individual CFs. The results show that TLD increases by up to 600% and AVGHT30 increases by up to 2\u20133\u2009km with increasing NCAPE and N40 for fixed WCD. The partial sensitivities of TLD/AVGHT30 to NCAPE and N40 separately were comparable in magnitude but account for a fraction of the total range of variability (i.e., when the influences of NCAPE and N40 are considered simultaneously). Both TLD and AVGHT30 vary inversely with WCD such that maxima of TLD and AVGHT30 are found for the combination of high NCAPE, high N40, and shallower WCD. The relationship between lightning and radar reflectivity was shown to vary as a function of N40 for a fixed thermodynamic environment. Analysis of VPRRs shows that reflectivity in the mixed phase region is up to 5.0\u20135.6\u2009dB greater for CFs in polluted environments compared to CFs in pristine environments (holding thermodynamics fixed). This analysis favors a merged hypothesis for the simultaneous roles of thermodynamics and aerosols as they influence deep convective clouds in the Tropics.",

        "description": "\n\nWe present alternative methods for estimating spatial surrogates and temporal factors for ammonia (NH3) emissions from chemical fertilizer usage (CFU), in the USA, at spatial and temporal scales used to simulate regional air quality and deposition of reactive nitrogen to ecosystems. The newly developed Improved Spatial Surrogate (ISS) method incorporates year-specific fertilizer sales data, high resolution and year-specific crop maps, and local crop nitrogen demands to allocate NH3 emissions at 4\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009km grid cells. Results are compared with the commonly used gridded emission estimates by the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) preprocessor. NH3 emissions over Central Illinois in the USA, estimated at the 4\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009km grid level in SMOKE and ISS methods, exhibit differences between \u221210% and 120%, with 58% of the grid cells exhibiting more than \u00b110% difference. Application of the ISS method for a larger domain over the Midwest USA, at 4\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009km, reflected similar differences. We also employed the Denitrification Decomposition (DNDC) model to develop daily temporal factors of NH3 emissions from CFU using multi-site and multi-year analyses. Ratio of temporal factors estimated by SMOKE and DNDC methods is 0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20092.35, with DNDC identifying daily emission peaks 2.5\u20138 times greater than SMOKE. Identified emission peaks will be useful for future air quality modeling efforts to understand particulate matter episodes, as well as trends in regional particulate matter formation and nitrogen deposition for Midwest USA, using the proposed NH3 emissions inventory.",

        "description": "\n\nSulfate aerosols simulated by an aerosol module coupled to the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) at a spatial resolution (220\u2009km) widely used by global climate models were evaluated by a comparison with in situ observations and the same aerosol module coupled to the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) over East Asia for January, April, July, and October 2006. The results indicated that a horizontal gradient of sulfate from the source over China to the outflow over Korea-Japan was present in both the simulations and the observations. At the observation sites, the correlation coefficients of the sulfate concentrations between the simulations and the observations were high (NICAM: 0.49\u20130.89, MIROC: 0.61\u20130.77), whereas the simulated sulfate concentrations were lower than those obtained by the observation with the normalized mean bias of NICAM being \u221268 to \u221254% (all), \u221277 to \u221263% (source), and \u221267 to \u221230% (outflow) and that of MIROC being \u221261 to \u221228% (all), \u221277 to \u221263% (source), and \u221260 to +2% (outflow). Both NICAM and MIROC strongly underpredict surface SO2 over China source regions and Korea-Japan outflow regions, but the MIROC SO2 is much higher than NICAM SO2 over both regions. These differences between the models were mainly explained by differences in the sulfate formation within clouds and the dry deposition of SO2. These results indicated that the uncertainty of the meteorological and cloud fields as well as the vertical transport patterns between the different host climate models has a substantial impact on the simulated sulfate distribution.",

        "description": "\n\nEmissions of methane (CH4) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from oil and gas production may have large impacts on air quality and climate change. Methane and VOCs were measured over the Haynesville and Marcellus shale gas plays on board the National Center for Atmospheric Research C-130 and NOAA WP-3D research aircraft in June\u2013July of 2013. We used an eddy covariance technique to measure in situ fluxes of CH4 and benzene from both C-130 flights with high-resolution data (10\u2009Hz) and WP-3D flights with low-resolution data (1\u2009Hz). Correlation (R\u2009=\u20090.65) between CH4 and benzene fluxes was observed when flying over shale gas operations, and the enhancement ratio of fluxes was consistent with the corresponding concentration observations. Fluxes calculated by the eddy covariance method show agreement with a mass balance approach within their combined uncertainties. In general, CH4 fluxes in the shale gas regions follow a lognormal distribution, with some deviations for relatively large fluxes (>10\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121). Statistical analysis of the fluxes shows that a small number of facilities (i.e., ~10%) are responsible for up to ~40% of the total CH4 emissions in the two regions. We show that the airborne eddy covariance method can also be applied in some circumstances when meteorological conditions do not favor application of the mass balance method. We suggest that the airborne eddy covariance method is a reliable alternative and complementary analysis method to estimate emissions from oil and gas extraction.",

        "description": "\nThe urban population of South America has grown at 1.05%/yr, greater urbanization increasing problems related to air pollution. In most large cities in South America, there has been no continuous long-term measurement of regulated pollutants. One exception is S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where an air quality monitoring network has been in place since the 1970s. In this paper, we used an air quality-based approach to determine pollutant trends for emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), and coarse particulate matter (PM10), mostly from mobile sources, in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo for the 2000\u20132013 period. Mobile sources included light-duty vehicles (LDVs, comprising gasoline- or ethanol-powered cars and motorcycles) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs, comprising diesel-powered trucks and buses). Pollutant concentrations for mobile source emissions were measured and correlated with fuel sales by the emission factors. Over the 2000\u20132013 period, concentrations of NOx, CO, and PM10 decreased by 0.65, 0.37, and 0.71%\u2009month\u22121, respectively, whereas sales of gasoline, ethanol, and diesel increased by 0.26, 1.96, and 0.38%\u2009month\u22121, respectively. LDVs were the major mobile source of CO, whereas LDVs were the major source of NOx and PM10. Increases in fuel sales and in the corresponding traffic volume were partially offset by decreases in pollutant concentrations. Between 2000 and 2013, there was a sharp (\u22125\u2009ppb\u2009month\u22121) decrease in the concentrations of LDV-emitted CO, together with (less dramatic) decreases in the concentrations of HDV-emitted NOx and PM10 (\u22120.25 and \u22120.09\u2009ppb\u2009month\u22121, respectively). Variability was greater for HDV-emitted NOx and PM10 (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47 and \u22120.41, respectively) than for LDV-emitted CO (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.72). We draw the following conclusions: the observed concentrations of LDV-emitted CO decreased at a sharper rate than did those of HDV-emitted NOx and PM10; mobile source contributions to O3 formation varied significantly, LDVs making a greater contribution during the 2000\u20132008 period, whereas HDVs made a greater contribution during the 2009\u20132013 period, and decreases in NOx emissions resulted in increases in O3 observations.",
