        "description": "\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula has experienced pronounced interannual to decadal variability in dust activity, including an abrupt regime shift around 2006 from an inactive dust period during 1998\u20132005 to an active period during 2007\u20132013. Corresponding in time to the onset of this regime shift, the climate state transitioned into a combined La Ni\u00f1a and negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which incited a hiatus in global warming in the 2000s (Kosaka and Xie, 2013; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2013). Superimposed upon a long-term regional drying trend, synergistic interactions between these teleconnection modes triggered the establishment of a devastating and prolonged drought, which engulfed the Fertile Crescent, namely Iraq and Syria, and led to crop failure and civil unrest [Kelley et al., 2015]. Dried soils and diminished vegetation cover in the Fertile Crescent, as evident through remotely-sensed Enhanced Vegetation Indices, supported greater dust generation and transport to the Arabian Peninsula in 2007\u20132013, as identified both in increased dust days observed at weather stations and enhanced remotely-sensed aerosol optical depth. According to backward trajectory analysis of dust days on the Arabian Peninsula, increased dust lifting and atmospheric dust concentration in the Fertile Crescent during this recent, prolonged drought episode supported a greater frequency of dust events across the peninsula with associated northerly trajectories and led to the dust regime shift. These findings are particularly concerning, considering projections of warming and drying for the eastern Mediterranean region and potential collapse of the Fertile Crescent during this century [Kitoh et al., 2008].\n",

        "description": "\n\nA relatively simple land surface model, the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and the more complex Community Land Model (CLM3.5) coupled to RegCM4 are used to investigate land-atmosphere feedback processes during the Indian summer monsoon. Model simulations for 27 years show that the mean and interannual variability of rainfall and surface air temperature are affected significantly due to differences in the formulation of evapotranspiration and hydrological processes between BATS and CLM3.5, prescribed land-use land-cover data and changes in net radiation. RegCM4 with CLM3.5 (RCLM) shows a reduction in surface moisture flux and precipitation but an increase in surface air temperature over most parts of India as compared to RegCM4 with BATS (RBAT). In terms of the mean and interannual variability of rainfall over central India, RBAT performs better than RCLM.\nEvapotranspiration over central India is found to be less (more) sensitive to soil wetness variations in RCLM (RBAT) compared to the multimodel estimate from the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2), that is mainly attributed to the differences in ground evaporation and transpiration. Changes in evaporation efficiency between the models also lead to a reduction in the land-atmosphere coupling strength for precipitation in RCLM. Furthermore, such changes decrease the convective instability over central and eastern India in RCLM leading to weakened convection and reduced large-scale moisture convergence and precipitation over land. Observations of soil moisture, surface fluxes and radiation are needed for better understanding and improvement of coupled land-atmosphere feedbacks in models during the Indian summer monsoon.\n",

We evaluated the quality of TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 6 (3B42V6) and Version 7 (3B42V7) products on a daily and monthly basis for a 14-year time series by comparing with gridded ground-based rainfall data from ~3625 rain gauges distributed throughout Brazil. The results show that daily estimates are inaccurate for both Versions 6 and 7 (the refined index of agreement, dr, was less than 0.6 in most of the analyzed pixels). In general, both versions perform well on monthly basis (dr\u2009>\u20090.75) but no significant improvement between them could be identified with the exception of local areas. TMPA performed poorly in the Northwest region, where rainfall depths are higher in Brazil; however, the quality of the ground-based data is poor in this region because of low gauge density. Based on a seasonal analysis, we found that TMPA performed better during the dry seasons and that some improvements, although not significant, between successive versions took place over the Northeast, Southeast and South regions. This study shows the value of remote sensing precipitation for providing reliable, spatiotemporally continuous precipitation at monthly timescales.\n",

The record reaches from present day back to the penultimate glacial until 145,000\u2009yr BP with subannual resolution from 60,000\u2009yr BP to present. Mean dust concentrations are a factor of 46 higher during the Glacial (~850-4600\u2009ng/mL) compared to the Holocene (~16-112\u2009ng/mL) with slightly smaller dust particles during the Glacial compared to the Holocene and with an absolute minimum in the dust size at 16,000\u2009yr BP. The changes in dust concentration are mainly attributed to changes in source conditions in southern South America. An increase in the modal value of the dust size suggests that at 16,000\u2009yr BP a major change in atmospheric circulation apparently allowed more direct transport of dust particles to the EDML drill site. We find a clear in-phase relation of the seasonal variation in dust mass concentration and dust size during the Glacial (r(conc,size)\u2009=\u20090.8) but no clear phase relationship during the Holocene (0\u2009<\u2009r(conc,size)\u2009<\u20090.4). With a simple conceptual 1D-model describing the transport of the dust to the ice sheet using the size as an indicator for transport intensity, we find that the effect of the changes in the seasonality of the source emission strength and the transport intensity on the dust decrease over Transition 1 can significantly contribute to the large decrease of dust concentration from the Glacial to the Holocene.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe geographical shift of global anthropogenic aerosols from the developed countries to the Asian continent since the 1980s could potentially perturb the regional and global climate due to aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. We use an atmospheric general circulation model with different aerosol scenarios to investigate the radiative and microphysical effects of anthropogenic aerosols from different regions on the radiation budget, precipitation, and large-scale circulations. An experiment contrasting anthropogenic aerosol scenarios in 1970 and 2010 shows that the altered cloud reflectivity and solar extinction by aerosols results in regional surface temperature cooling in East and South Asia, and warming in US and Europe respectively. These aerosol induced temperature changes are consistent with the relative temperature trends from 1980 to 2010 over different regions in the reanalysis data. A reduced meridional streamfunction and zonal winds over the tropics as well as a poleward shift of the jet stream suggest weakened and expanded tropical circulations, which are induced by the redistributed aerosols through a relaxing of the meridional temperature gradient. Consequently, precipitation is suppressed in the deep tropics and enhanced in the sub-tropics. Our assessments of the aerosol effects over the different regions suggest that the increasing of Asian pollution accounts for the weakening of the tropics circulation, while the decreasing of pollution in Europe and US tends to shift the circulation systems southward. Moreover, the aerosol indirect forcing is predominant over the total aerosol forcing in magnitude, while aerosol radiative and microphysical effects jointly shape the meridional energy distributions and modulate the circulation systems.\n",

The 30-member large ensemble coupled runs are analyzed along with one run with specified sea surface temperatures for 1994 to 2005 (to avoid volcanic eruptions). The vertical structure of the CESM temperature profile tends to be top-heavy in the model, with too much deep convection and not enough lower stratospheric cooling as part of the response to tropospheric heating. There is too much absorbed solar radiation (ASR) over the southern oceans and not enough in the tropics, and ENSO is too large in amplitude in this version of the model. However, the co-variability of monthly mean anomalies produces remarkably good replication of most of the observed relationships. There is a lot more high frequency variability in radiative fluxes than in temperature, highlighting the role of clouds and transient weather systems in the radiation statistics. Over the Warm Pool in the tropical western Pacific and Indian oceans, where non-local effects from the Walker circulation driven by the ENSO events are important, several related biases emerge: in response to high SST anomalies there is more precipitation, water vapor and cloud, and less ASR and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) in the model than observed. Different model global mean trends are evident, however, and possibly hinting at too much positive cloud feedback in the model.\n",

        "description": "\n\nAmines have recently been found to be an important ingredient in the nucleation and initial growth of atmospheric aerosols; however, global estimates of the spatial and temporal extent of amine-enhanced nucleation are currently missing. We utilize two recently published laboratory datasets of amine-sulfuric acid nucleation to evaluate the accuracy of previously published nucleation parameterizations, as well as to produce a new amine-enhanced new particle formation (NPF) parameterization that better reproduces the laboratory observations at atmospherically relevant sulfuric acid concentrations. We implement and compare the amine-enhanced NPF parameterizations and a kinetic nucleation parameterization within the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ, and find that the spatial features of amine-enhanced and kinetic NPF are clearly different. Amine-enhanced NPF is limited to areas near the source regions of amine due to its short gas-phase residence time of 6.9 hours, whereas kinetic nucleation (which depends only on sulfuric acid concentration) produces particles more uniformly across the globe due to long-range transport of SO2. The notably stronger land-sea contrast in amine-enhanced nucleation simulations is in line with relatively rare atmospheric observations of NPF over open oceans. However, when the uptake of gas-phase amine molecules to aerosol particles is limited according to previously published estimates (0.2% of collisions leading to uptake), the amine-enhanced NPF parameterization predicts in some regions unrealistically high NPF rates (\u223c1000\u00a0cm\u22123s\u22121) compared to typical observations. Our results indicate that amine-enhanced nucleation may be an important particle formation mechanism near amine source regions, but also highlights the need for more tightly defined constraints on the spatial and temporal distribution of amine emissions, gas-to-particle partitioning mechanisms of amines, as well as condensation and coagulation sinks in global models.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOne of the challenges in evaluating and applying regional climate models (RCMs) is the non-linear behavior of atmospheric processes, which is still poorly understood. The non-linearities induce chaos which leads to an internal variability in the model. Therefore, an ensemble of RCM simulations has been run and a budget study for potential temperature has been applied to investigate the internally generated variability. Hence, the physical processes associated with diabatic and dynamical terms inducing the inter-member variability have been analyzed. The study is applied over the Arctic on an ensemble of 20 members, differing in their initial conditions, simulated with the RCM HIRHAM5 during summer 2012. This time period is of particular importance because of the melting sea ice and its influence on atmospheric circulation and the resulting effect on the inter-member variability. The amplitude of the inter-member variability of the simulations fluctuates strongly both temporally and spatially. During the beginning of August 2012 the inter-member variability is strongest and coincides with the great Arctic cyclone event. The most important contributions for the inter-member variability tendency are the horizontal and vertical \u2018baroclinic\u2019 terms. Both terms have largest absolute values along the coastlines of the Arctic Ocean which are associated with the Arctic frontal zone leading to the cyclone maximum over the Arctic Ocean during summer.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn this study, we investigated how different degrees of urbanization affect local and regional rainfall using high-resolution simulations based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. The extreme rainfall event of July 21, 2012, in Beijing was simulated for three representative urban land-use distributions (no urbanization, early urbanization level of 1980, and recent urbanization level of 2009). Results suggest that urban modification of rainfall is potentially sensitive to urban land-use condition. Rainfall was increased significantly over the downwind Beijing metropolis because of the effects of early urbanization; however, recent conditions of high urban development caused no significant increase. Further comparative analysis revealed that positive urban thermo-dynamical effects (i.e., urban warming, increased sensible heat transportation, and enhanced convergence and vertical motions) play major roles in urban modification of rainfall during the early urbanization stage. However, after cities expand to a certain extent (i.e., urban agglomeration), the regional moisture depression induced by the prevalence of impervious urban land has an effect on atmospheric instability energy, which might negate the city's positive impact on regional rainfall. Additional results from regional climate simulations for 10 Julys confirm this supposition. Given the explosive urban population growth and increasing demand for freshwater in cities, the potential negative effects of the urban environment on precipitation are worth investigation, particularly in rapidly developing countries and regions.\n",

Scanning transmission x-ray microscopy/near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (STXM/NEXAFS) and computer controlled scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM/EDX) were used to probe the composition of the organic and inorganic fraction of individual particles collected on June 27th and 28th during the 2010 Carbonaceous Aerosols and Radiative Effects (CARES) study in the Central Valley, California. The first field site, T0, was located in downtown Sacramento, while T1 was located near the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Mass estimates of the aerosol particle components were used to calculate mixing state metrics, such as the particle-specific diversity, bulk population diversity, and mixing state index, for each sample. The STXM data showed evidence of changes in the mixing state associated with a build-up of organic matter confirmed by collocated measurements and the largest impact on the mixing state was due to an increase in soot dominant particles during this build-up. The mixing state from STXM was similar between T0 and T1 indicating that the increased organic fraction at T1 had a small effect on the mixing state of the population. The CCSEM/EDX analysis showed the presence of two types of particle populations; the first was dominated by aged sea salt particles and had a higher mixing state index (indicating a more homogeneous population), the second was dominated by carbonaceous particles and had a lower mixing state index.\n",

Deep convection, particularly that associated with typhoons, is believed to be an important source of gravity waves. Stratospheric gravity waves induced by Typhoon Mindulle (2004) were detected by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Semicircular GWs with horizontal wavelengths of 100\u2013400 km were found over Taiwan through an inspection of AIRS radiances at 4.3 \u03bcm. Characteristics of the stratospheric gravity waves generated by Typhoon Mindulle were investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The initial and boundary data were determined by the high-resolution European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis data. The WRF simulation reproduces the main features of Typhoon Mindulle and the significant GWs. The simulated GWs with horizontal wavelengths of 100\u2013400 km match the AIRS observations: they propagate upward and eastward, and the westward components are mostly filtered in the stratosphere. By comparing the measured waves with a WRF simulation in the absent of orography (WRF-FLAT), we find that the orographic gravity waves (OGWs) generated by the flow of Typhoon Mindulle over the Central Mountain Range (CMR) in Taiwan account for approximately 50% of the total wave momentum flux in the troposphere. The dominant orientation of the OGW wave fronts is parallel to the CMR rideline. When entering into the stratosphere, OGW propagation is determined by the position of the typhoon center relative to the CMR.\n",

A process-based evaluation of atmospheric circulation features associated with wet Northeast summers is performed to examine whether credibility can be differentiated within the multimodel ensemble. Based on these evaluations, and an analysis of the interannual statistical properties of area-averaged precipitation, model subsets were formed. Multimodel precipitation projections from each subset were compared to the \u00d2ALL\u00d3 model projection. Higher resolution NARCCAP regional climate models (RCMs) were subjected to a similar evaluation, grouping into subsets, and examination of future projections. CMIP5 models adequately simulate most large-scale circulation features associated with wet Northeast summers, though all have errors in simulating observed sea level pressure and moisture divergence anomalies in the western tropical Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico. Relevant large-scale processes simulated by the RCMs resemble those of their driving GCMs, which are not always realistic. Future RCM studies could benefit from a process analysis of potential driving GCMs prior to dynamical downscaling. No CMIP5 or NARCCAP models were identified as clearly more credible, but six GCMs and four RCMs performed consistently better. Among the \u201cBetter\" models, there is no consistency in the direction of future summer precipitation change. CMIP5 projections suggest that the Northeast precipitation response depends on the dynamics of the North Atlantic anticyclone and associated circulation and moisture convergence patterns, which vary among \u201cBetter\" models. Even when model credibility cannot be clearly differentiated, examination of simulated processes provides important insights into their evolution under greenhouse warming.\n",

Special emphasis has been placed on both ensuring the temporal homogeneity and including the most recent years in the dataset. We have generated, for the first time, composite time series for Europe covering the period 1939-2012, which have been studied by means of running trend analysis. The mean annual SSR series shows an increase from the late 1930s to the early 1950s (i.e., early brightening), followed by a reduction until mid-1980s (i.e., global dimming) and a subsequent increase up to the early-2000s (i.e., global brightening). The series ends with a tendency of stabilization since the early 21st century, but the short time period is insufficient with regard to establishing whether a change in the trend is actually emerging over Europe. Seasonal and regional variations are also presented, which highlight that similar variations are obtained for most of the seasons and regions across Europe. In fact, due to the strong spatial correlation in the SSR series, few series are enough to capture almost the same interannual and decadal variability as using a dense network of stations. Decadal variations of the SSR are expected to have an impact on the modulation of the temperatures and other processes over Europe linked with changes in the hydrological cycle, agriculture production, or natural ecosystems. For a better dissemination of the time series developed in this study, the dataset is freely available for scientific purposes.\n",

In this work, we report 10 months of hourly PM2.5 oxalate measurements by a MARGA (Monitor for Aerosols & Gases in ambient Air) at a suburban coastal site in Hong Kong from April 2012 to February 2013. A total of more than 6000 sets of oxalate and inorganic ion data were obtained. The mean (\u00b1sd) oxalate concentration was 0.34 (\u00b10.18) \u00b5g m-3, accounting for 2.8% of the total ion mass and 1.5% of the PM2.5 mass. Seasonal variation showed higher concentrations in fall and winter (0.54 and 0.36 \u00b5g m-3, respectively) and lower concentrations in spring and summer (~0.26 \u00b5g m-3). Different from the inorganic ions, a shallow dip in the oxalate concentration consistently occurred in the morning after sunrise (around 9 am) throughout all seasons. Our analysis suggests that this was likely due to photolysis of oxalate-Fe (III) complex by UV radiation. In summer, a small daytime peak was discernable for oxalate and nitrate. This characteristic, together with a more evident diurnal variation of O3, indicates comparatively more active photochemical oxidation in summer than other seasons. High correlations were observed between oxalate and non-sea salt SO42- (NSS) (R2=0.63) and Ox (O3+NO2) (R2=0.48), indicating significant commonality in their secondary formation. Positive matrix factorization analysis of oxalate and other real-time gas and particle-phase component data estimates that secondary formation processes, including secondary gas or aqueous oxidation processes (49%), oxidation processes of biomass burning emissions (37%), accounted for the majority of PM2.5 oxalate. A backward trajectories cluster analysis found higher oxalate/NSS ratios were associated with low pollution samples under the influence of marine air masses while the ratios were lower in high pollution samples that were typically associated with continental air masses passing through areas of high anthropogenic emissions. Isolating the \u2018low pollution marine\u2019 aerosols across the entire dataset indicates that oxalate production increased in the summer compared to other seasons, suggesting either more active marine emissions of oxalate precursors or stronger photochemical processes in the summer.\n",

In the variational scheme, a cost function is defined to measure the distance between analyzed precipitation field and observed rainfall quantity. A recursive filter is incorporated into the cost function which helps spread the observations to nearby grid points. Then a quasi-Newton method is used to solve the optimal estimation problem by minimizing the cost function. The adjoint technique is used to derive the gradient of cost function with respect to analysis precipitation. A series of experiments are performed to inter-compare the variational analysis with the original CMORPH satellite products (CMP) and the bias-adjusted satellite products (Adj-CMP) against the observations. The best overall performance is from the variational analysis especially rainfall intensity by more than 10 mm hr-1 with a prevailing mean relative spatial bias nearly reduction zero and the correlation coefficient is almost around 0.5 in convection active areas. Ground Cross Validation experiments in which each affected station is withdrawal at once indicated that the variatoinal analysis can particularly be beneficial and subsequent investigation of heavy rainfall events. It also reveals that the precipitation analysis field has the ability to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation and capture the spatial precipitation pattern agreements in relatively data-sparse regions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe cloud water content (CWC) in rainy clouds is a crucial parameter to determine the onset and the growth rate of precipitation, and to quantify the associated latent heating rate. No direct retrieval of CWC in rainy cloud from satellite observations is reported due to the difficulties of separating cloud particles from precipitation sized particles. However, based on multiple cloud simulations from the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model, we have found that the CWC profile in warm rains can be well determined by three macro-physical cloud properties of cloud water path (CWP), cloud top height (CTH), and cloud bottom height (CBH). The CBH can be estimated using CWP, CTH and near surface rain rate. We proposed an algorithm with a lookup table for estimating the CWC profile using CWP, CTH and near surface rain rate as inputs. The performance of this algorithm was tested with WRF model simulations and a real drizzle case observed by the CloudSat satellite. Testing verified that the algorithm can retrieve the vertical distribution of CWC correctly with few errors at different spatiotemporal scales. In addition, the algorithm is not confined to particular microphysics schemes and is valid for multiple cloud systems in different areas over the world. This algorithm is expected to improve current knowledge of cloud water content in rainy clouds.\n",

Data from four successive flight tracks are employed here to assess the characteristics and variability of the larger- and smaller-scale GWs, including their spatial scales, amplitudes, phase speeds, and momentum fluxes. On each flight, a large-scale mountain wave (MW) having a horizontal wavelength ~200-300 km was observed. Smaller-scale GWs over the island appeared to correlate within the warmer phase of this large-scale MW. This analysis reveals that momentum fluxes accompanying small-scale MWs and propagating GWs significantly exceed those of the large-scale MW and the mean values typical for these altitudes, with maxima for the various small-scale events in the range ~20-105 m2s-2.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe observed summertime drying over Northern Central India (NCI) during the latter half of the 20th century is not reproduced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble average. At the same time, the spread between precipitation trends from individual model realizations is large, indicating that internal variability potentially plays an important role in explaining the observed trend. Here we show that the drying is indeed related to the observed 1950-1999 positive trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and that the relationship is even stronger for a simpler index (S1). Adjusting the CMIP5 simulated precipitation trends to account for the difference between the observed and simulated S1 trend increases the original multi-model average NCI drying trend from \u22120.09\u00b10.31 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 to \u22120.51\u00b10.40 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 . Thus, our estimate of the 1950-1999 NCI drying associated with Pacific decadal variability is of similar magnitude as our previous CMIP5 based estimate of the drying due to anthropogenic aerosol. The drying (moistening) associated with increasing (decreasing) S1 can partially be attributed to a southeastward (northwestward) shift of the boundary between ascent and descent affecting NCI. This shift of the ascent region strongly affects NCI, butnot Southeast Asia and south China. The average spread between individual model realizations is only slightly reduced when adjusting for S1 as smaller scale variability also plays an important role.\n",

Over the course of the eruption, daily volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions exceeded daily SO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources in Europe in 2010 by at least a factor of three. We present surface air quality observations from across Northern Europe together with satellite remote-sensing data and model simulations of volcanic SO2 for September 2014. We show that volcanic SO2 was transported in the lowermost troposphere over long distances and detected by air quality monitoring stations up to 2750\u2009km away from the source. Using retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), we calculate an average daily SO2 mass burden of 99\u2009\u00b1\u200949 kilotons (kt) of SO2 from OMI and 61\u2009\u00b1\u200918 kt of SO2 from IASI for September 2014. This volcanic burden is at least a factor of two greater than the average SO2 mass burden between 2007 and 2009 due to anthropogenic emissions from the whole of Europe. Combining the observational data with model simulations using the United Kingdom Met Office's NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment) model, we are able to constrain SO2 emission rates to up to 120 kilotons per day (kt/d) during early September 2014, followed by a decrease to 20\u201360 kt/d between 6 and 22 September 2014, followed by a renewed increase to 60\u2013120 kt/d until the end of September 2014. Based on these fluxes, we estimate that the eruption emitted a total of 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 Tg of SO2 into the atmosphere during September 2014, in good agreement with ground-based remote sensing and petrological estimates. Although satellite-derived and model-simulated vertical column densities of SO2 agree well, the model simulations are biased low by up to a factor of eight when compared to surface observations of volcanic SO2 on 6\u20137 September 2014 in Ireland. These biases are mainly due to relatively small horizontal and vertical positional errors in the simulations of the volcanic plume occurring over transport distances of thousands of kilometers. Although the volcanic air pollution episodes were transient and lava-dominated volcanic eruptions are sporadic events, the observations suggest that (i) during an eruption, volcanic SO2 measurements should be assimilated for near real-time air quality forecasting, and (ii) existing air quality monitoring networks should be retained or extended to monitor SO2 and other volcanic pollutants.\n",

We isolated eighteen unique transport events over 2 years using observations of Hg and CO at a high-altitude background site in southwestern China (Mt. Ailao Observatory Station) to assess the transport and impact of Hg emissions from biomass burning. The quantity of Hg emission and the source regions were determined using \u0394TGM/\u0394CO slopes coupled with backward trajectory analysis and CO emission inventories. The slopes of \u0394TGM/\u0394CO appeared to be a useful chemical indicator for source identification. Industrial emission sources exhibited slopes in the range of 5.1-61.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 (pptv/pptv), in contrast to a slope of 2.0-6.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 for typical biomass burning. Transboundary transport of Hg from biomass burning led to episodically elevated atmospheric Hg concentrations during springtime. Hg emissions from biomass burning in the Indo-China Peninsula region from 2001 to 2008 were estimated to be 11.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1Mg yr\u22121, equivalent to 40% of annual anthropogenic emissions in the region. In addition, Hg emissions from biomass burning contained a substantial fraction of PBM. Assuming that PBM readily deposits locally (within 50 km), the local Hg deposition caused by the PBM was estimated to be 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 Mg yr\u22121, up to 1 order of magnitude higher than the PBM deposition caused by anthropogenic emissions during springtime in the region. The strong springtime emissions potentially pose a threat to the ecosystems of the Indo-China Peninsula and southwest China.\n",

Four infrasound sensor arrays were deployed in central New Mexico in February 2014; three of these arrays captured infrasound from a large wind farm. The arrays were in a linear configuration oriented southeast with 13, 54, 90, and 126 km radial distance and azimuths of 166\u00b0, 119\u00b0, 113\u00b0, and 111\u00b0 from the 60 1.6-MW turbine Red Mesa Wind Farm (RMWF), Laguna Pueblo, New Mexico, USA.\nPeaks at a fundamental frequency slightly below 0.9 Hz and its harmonics characterize the spectrum of the detected infrasound. The generation of this signal is linked to the interaction of the blades, flow gradients, and the supporting tower. The production of wind-farm sound, its propagation, and detection at long distances can be related to the characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer. First, under stable conditions, mostly occurring at night, winds are highly stratified, which enhances the production of thickness sound (TS) and the modulation of other higher-frequency wind turbine sounds. Second, nocturnal atmospheric conditions can create low-altitude waveguides (with altitudes on the order of 100s of meters) allowing long distance propagation. Third, night and early morning hours are characterized by reduced background atmospheric noise that enhances signal detectability. This work describes the characteristics of the infrasound from a quasi-continuous source with the potential for long-range propagation that could be used to monitor the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer.\n",

The different capabilities of MOPITT and IASI retrievals are highlighted, with particular attention to instrument vertical sensitivity and coverage and how these impact the analyses. MOPITT and IASI CO retrievals mostly constrain the CO fields close to the main anthropogenic, biogenic and biomass burning CO sources. In the case of IASI CO assimilation, we also observe constraints on CO far from the sources. During the simulation time period (June and July 2008), CO assimilation of both instruments strongly improves the atmospheric CO state as compared to independent observations, with the higher spatial coverage of IASI providing better results on the global scale. However, the enhanced sensitivity of multispectral MOPITT observations to near surface CO over the main source regions provides synergistic effects at regional scales.\n",

Much of this cloud optical depth increase has been hypothesized to be due to transitions from ice-dominated to liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud. In this study, the importance of liquid-ice partitioning for the optical depth feedback is quantified for 19 CMIP5 models. All models show a monotonic partitioning of ice and liquid as a function of temperature, but the temperature at which ice and liquid are equally mixed (the glaciation temperature) varies by as much as 40K across models. Models that have a higher glaciation temperature are found to have a smaller climatological liquid water path (LWP) and condensed water path, and experience a larger increase in LWP as the climate warms. The ice-liquid partitioning curve of each model may be used to calculate the response of LWP to warming. It is found that the re-partitioning between ice and liquid in a warming climate contributes at least 20% to 80% of the increase in LWP as the climate warms, depending on model. Inter-model differences in the climatological partitioning between ice and liquid are estimated to contribute at least 20% to the inter-model spread in the high-latitude LWP response in the mixed-phase region poleward of 45\u00b0S. It is hypothesized that a more thorough evaluation and constraint of GCM mixed-phase cloud parameterizations, and validation of the total condensate and ice-liquid apportionment against observations will yield a substantial reduction in model uncertainty in the high-latitude cloud response to warming.\n",

Method 1 applies the mass adjusted energy divergence from ERA-Interim while method 2 estimates energy divergence based upon the net energy difference at the top of atmosphere and the surface from ERA-Interim. To optimise the surface flux and its variability over ocean, the divergences over land are constrained to match the monthly area mean surface net energy flux variability derived from a simple relationship between the surface net energy flux and the surface temperature change. The energy divergences over the oceans are then adjusted to remove an unphysical residual global mean atmospheric energy divergence. The estimated net surface energy fluxes are compared with other data sets from reanalysis and atmospheric model simulations. The spatial correlation coefficients of multi-annual means between the estimations made here and other data sets are all around 0.9. There are good agreements in area mean anomaly variability over the global ocean, but discrepancies in the trend over the eastern Pacific are apparent.\n",

However, there have been few studies regarding the trends, including their spatial patterns, in ice phenology for individual waterbodies on a local or small regional scale, although the coherence of ice phenology has been shown to decline rapidly in the first few hundred kilometers. In this study, we extracted trends, analyzed affecting factors, and investigated relevant spatial patterns for ice breakup date time series at ten locations with record length \u2265\u200590 years in south-central Ontario, Canada. Wavelet methods, including the multi-resolution analysis (MRA) method for non-linear trend extraction and the wavelet coherence (WTC) method for identifying the teleconnections between large-scale climate modes and ice breakup date, are proved to be effective in ice phenology analysis. Using MRA method, the overall trend of ice breakup date time series (1905-1991) varied from earlier ice breakup to later ice breakup, then to earlier breakup again from south to north in south-central Ontario. Ice breakup date is closely correlated with air temperature during certain winter/spring months, as well as the last day with snow on the ground and number of snow-on-ground days. The influences of solar activity and Pacific North American (PNA) on ice breakup were comparatively uniform across south-central Ontario, while those of El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) on ice phenology changed with distance of 50\u2005\u2013\u2005100 km in the north\u2013south direction.\n",

Although several studies have investigated Arctic inversion characteristics such as height, depth, and frequency, there are significant challenges for long-term climate monitoring mainly due to limited sampling over the ocean and/or poor resolution of available observations. This study investigates the Arctic temperature inversion during the cold season using the high-resolution refractivity profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO). For the coldest and driest months in the Arctic, a reliable retrieval technique for boundary layer properties, such as inversion height and surface-based inversion (SBI) frequency, is developed. We find that these variables have a strong negative relationship over the Arctic Ocean and are well-correlated in the time and space domain. The spatial patterns show a minimum inversion height (maximum SBI frequency) over the ice-covered Pacific sector of the ocean similar to that observed in past studies. Seasonal evolution of the inversion characteristics suggests a surface temperature control over the sea ice region, with the peak in SBI frequency occurring during the transition period from winter to spring. There is little diurnal variability in the mean inversion height during the cold season. Despite its limitations, the RO refractivity profile is found quite useful for monitoring the Arctic boundary layer, including interannual variability of inversion characteristics.\n",

Trajectories are calculated using offline calculations of seasonal mean tropical radiative heating rates along with reanalysis temperature and wind data with enhanced wave-driven variability in the TTL. The one-dimensional (vertical) time-dependent cloud microphysical model is initialized with water vapor measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder and the evolution of clouds along each trajectory is simulated using temperature profiles extracted from reanalysis data and convective cloud top heights estimated from 3-hourly geostationary satellite imagery. Averaged over the tropics, waves dehydrate the 100 hPa level by 0.5 ppmv, while convection and cloud microphysical processes moisten by 0.3 and 0.7 ppmv, respectively. The tropical mean cloud occurrence frequencies in the mid to upper TTL agree well with those based on satellite observations (spatial correlation of 0.8). Waves and convection enhance cloud occurrence at the cold point tropopause by 4% and 2%, respectively. Temporal variability of the heating rates as indicated by the ERA-Interim 6-hourly heating rate fields dehydrates the TTL by 0.4 ppmv and decreases the cloud occurrence by 4% because parcels are more likely to encounter the coldest temperatures and dehydrate near the cold point, limiting cloud formation above. The final dehydration locations of parcels, concentrated near the dateline in the tropical Pacific, are insensitive to various model parameters.\n",

The global anthropogenic aerosol climate feedback parameter (\u2212\u2009\u03b1) of -1.13 \u00b1 0.33 Wm-2K-1 is indistinguishable from the greenhouse gas \u2212\u2009\u03b1 of -1.28 \u00b1 0.23 Wm-2K-1. However, this greenhouse gas climate feedback parameter is about 50% larger than that obtained for CM3 from a widely used linear extrapolation method of regressing Earth's top of atmosphere imbalance against surface air temperature change in idealized CO2 radiative forcing experiments. This implies that the global mean surface temperature change due to forcing over the 1870-2005 period is 50% smaller than that predicted using the climate feedback parameter obtained from idealized experiments. This difference results from time-dependence in \u03b1, which makes the radiative forcing obtained by the fixed SST method incompatible with that obtained by the linear extrapolation method fitted over the first 150 years after CO2 is quadrupled. On a regional scale, \u03b1 varies greatly between the greenhouse gas and aerosol case. This suggests that the relationship between transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity obtained from idealized CO2 simulations, using techniques such as regional feedback analysis and heat uptake efficacy, may not hold for other forcing scenarios.\n",

On seasonal timescales, the rain moves across the equator following the sun, resulting in wet and dry seasons in the tropics. The position of the tropical rain belt also varies on longer time scales. Through the latter half of the 20th century, for example, shifts in tropical rainfall have been associated with severe droughts, including the African Sahel and Amazon droughts. Here, I show that climate models project a northward migration of the tropical rain belt through the 21st century, with future anthropogenic aerosol reductions driving the bulk of the shift. Models that include both aerosol indirect effects yield significantly larger northward shifts than models that lack aerosol indirect effects. Moreover, the rate of the shift corresponds to the rate of the decrease of anthropogenic aerosol emissions across different time periods and future emission scenarios. This response is consistent with relative warming of the Northern Hemisphere, a decrease in northward cross-equatorial moist static energy transport, and a northward shift of the Hadley circulation, including the tropical rain belt. The shift is relatively weak in the Atlantic sector, consistent with both a smaller decrease in aerosol emissions and a larger reduction in northward cross equatorial ocean heat flux. Although aerosol effects remain uncertain, I conclude that future reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions may be the dominant driver of a 21st century northward shift of the tropical rain belt.\n",

        "description": "\n\nUsing a low-frequency lightning location system comprising 11 sites, we located preliminary breakdown (PB) processes in 662 intracloud (IC) lightning flashes during the summer of 2013 in Osaka area of Japan. On the basis of three-dimensional location results, we studied initiation altitude and upward propagation speed of PB processes. PB in most IC flashes has an initiation altitude ranged from 5 to 10\u2009km with an average of 7.8\u2009km. Vertical speed ranges from 0.5 to 17.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009m/s with an average of 4.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009m/s. Vertical speed is closely related with initiation altitude, with IC flashes initiated at higher altitude having lower vertical speed during PB stage. Characteristics of PB pulse trains including pulse rate, pulse amplitude and pulse width are also analyzed. The relationship between pulse rate and vertical speed has the strongest correlation, suggesting that each PB pulse corresponds to one step of the initial leader during the PB stage. Pulse rate, pulse amplitude and pulse width all show decreasing trends with increasing initiation altitude and increasing trends with increasing vertical speed. Using a simple model, the step length of the initial leader during the PB stage is estimated. Most of initial leaders have step lengths ranged from 40 to 140\u2009m with an average of 113\u2009m. Estimated step length has a strong correlation with initiation altitude, indicating that leaders initiated at higher altitude have longer steps. Based on the results of this study, we speculate that above certain altitude (~12\u2009km), initial leaders in PB stages of IC flashes may only have horizontal propagations. PB processes at very high altitude may also have very weak radiation, so detecting and locating them would be relatively difficult.\n",

Insoluble and soluble particles larger than 0.45 \u00b5m were extracted from the ice core by ice sublimation and their chemical composition was analyzed using scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. We show that the dominant insoluble components are silicates, whereas NaCl, Na2SO4, CaSO4, and CaCO3 represent major soluble salts. For the first time, particles of CaMg(CO3)2 and Ca(NO3)2\u20224H2O are identified in a Greenland ice core. The chemical speciation of salts varies with past climatic conditions. Whereas the fraction of Na-salts (NaCl + Na2SO4) exceeds that of Ca-salts (CaSO4 + CaCO3) during the Holocene (0.6\u201311.7 kyr BP), the two fractions are similar during the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d period (12.9\u201314.6 kyr BP). During cold climate such as over the Younger Dryas (12.0\u201312.6 kyr BP) and the Last Glacial Maximum (15.0\u201326.9 kyr BP), the fraction of Ca-salts exceeds that of Na-salts, showing that the most abundant ion generally controls the salt budget in each period. High-resolution analyses reveal changing particle compositions: those in Holocene ice show seasonal changes, and those in LGM ice show a difference between cloudy bands and clear layers, which again can be largely explained by the availability of ionic components in the atmospheric aerosol body of air masses reaching Greenland.\n",

In the simulations on the f-plane, two TCs show mutual cyclonic rotations with symmetric structures. Two TCs with thermodynamic profiles of larger convective available potential energy (CAPE) and maximum potential intensity (MPI) show greater interaction than those with a smaller CAPE and MPI due to the stronger tangential velocity near the TC center. In the simulations on the \u03b2-plane, the two TCs do not merge, because the beta effect prevents the attraction of the two TCs by generating asymmetric motions of the TC with northwestward forcing. The relative strengths of the two TCs change with time and depend on the low-level inflow influenced by the Coriolis parameter. Similar to the results on the f-plane, the two TCs only merge with the thermodynamic soundings of large CAPE and MPI.\n",

Quantification of modern emission, transport and deposition of terrestrial dust and other airborne material from Southern Hemisphere sources is challenging due to low emission levels and poor detection from remote sensing platforms. Here, forward trajectory modeling is used to explore atmospheric transport, independent of deposition processes, from 1979 to 2013. Trajectories are initiated from known arid dust source areas in South America (Patagonia), Australia, and southern Africa, with detailed consideration of New Zealand as a potential source. Results suggest that Patagonian and New Zealand dust and other aerosol emissions share strong atmospheric transport during all seasons, allowing even potentially small New Zealand emissions to contribute significantly to Southern Ocean and Antarctic aerosol loading. We find that atmospheric transport controlling distribution of dust and other aerosols shows distinct spatial variability. New Zealand and Patagonia rapidly contribute a high proportion of trajectories to West Antarctica, while in interior East Antarctica source contributions are limited and highly mixed. The sensitivity of existing deep ice core sites to modern atmospheric transport is discussed. Finally, interannual variability of poleward trajectory extension over the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean highlights the association of both tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature and high-latitude wind variability (e.g. the Southern Annular Mode) with transport of dust and other aerosols to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.\n",

The Nabro volcano emitted 1\u20131.5 Mt of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere which resulted in a significant rise in the stratosphericsulfate aerosol burden in the months following the eruption. We have analyzed backscatter and extinction from ice clouds, as measured by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite between June 2006 and May 2014, to assess if volcanic aerosol produced by the Nabro eruption had affected ice clouds. We found no significant modifications of either of ice-cloud optical properties (i. e. total backscattering and extinction), occurrence frequencies or residence altitudes on a global scale. Using the analyzed optical properties as indicators of posteruptive ice-cloud radiative forcing modifications, we find that the eruption had no significant volcanic aerosol-ice cloud radiative effect. Our results suggest that the investigated optical properties of ice and cirrus clouds are at most weakly dependent on the sulfate droplet number density and size distribution.\n",

In Washington State, USA snowmelt from the seasonal snowpack provides an important source of water resources, but minimal work has been done characterizing BC concentrations in snow in this region. BC concentrations in snow were monitored over two winters (2012 and 2013) at Tronsen Meadow, located near Blewett Pass in the eastern Cascade Mountains in Central Washington, to characterize spatial and temporal variations in BC concentrations, and the processes affecting BC concentrations in the snowpack. BC concentrations were measured using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). Snowpit BC concentrations at spatial scales ranging from cm to 100 m scales were fairly homogenous during the accumulation season, with greater spatial variability during the melt season due to variable melt patterns. BC concentrations in snow increased in late winter-spring due to an increase in atmospheric BC concentrations and trapping of BC on the snow surface during melt. However, during a period of intense melt in 2013 BC concentrations decreased, likely caused by melt water scavenging. In summer 2012 the Table Mountain forest fire burned adjacent to the study site, and BC concentrations in the snowpack in 2013 were far higher than in previous years, with charred trees post-fire the likely source of the elevated BC.\n",

Maximum SPCZ area occurs at 1500 \u2013 1800 LST. Two minima in mean IR temperature are evident, one at 1300 \u2013 1600 LST, nearly coinciding with the maximum in area, and the second in the early morning hours at 0500 \u2013 0700 LST when area is at a minimum. The morning minimum in mean IR temperature is associated with a peak in deep convection while the afternoon minimum is associated with a peak in mid-level clouds. On average, the morning minimum in IR temperature dominates in the tropical regions of the SPCZ while the afternoon IR temperature minimum dominates in the subtropical regions of the SPCZ. The relative strength of the two IR temperature minima is affected by the seasonal cycle, intraseasonal variability associated with active Madden Julian Oscillation events, and interannual variability due to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. The morning IR temperature minimum becomes more dominant when the SPCZ is more frequently present or when the SPCZ is shifted toward the equator. In terms of cloud height, mid-level clouds dominate at all times in all regions of the SPCZ and peak in abundance between 1500 \u2013 1800 LST. Low-level clouds peak near midnight and then transition to high-level clouds, which peak between 0300 \u2013 0600 LST, just before sunrise.\n",

In that sense, a numerical model experiment was carried out to analyze the contribution of large-scale (changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions) and regional (increased urbanization) factors on the observed California South Coast Air Basin regional summer daily maximum temperature warming pattern from 1950 to 2013. The simulations were performed with past (1950\u201354) and present (2009\u201313) land-cover and climate conditions. The past land cover was derived from historical digital maps, the present land cover was updated with high-resolution airborne remote sensing data. Results show that both factors contribute to the total change in daily maximum temperatures. Changes due to large-scale climate conditions dominate in coastal (due to warming SSTs) and non-urban regions, while changes due to urbanization have an impact mainly in urban areas, especially inland where large-scale warming weakens. Increased urbanization has also reduced sea-breeze intensity due to changes in surface roughness. The model was able to reproduce the regional observed warming pattern, as it incorporates urban heat island effects, otherwise underestimated by large-scale climate change only.\n",

In this study, we use the atmospheric model WRF configured with high-spatial resolution to understand seasonal patterns of near-surface meteorological fields and precipitation processes in the Langtang catchment in the central Himalaya. Using a unique high-altitude observational network, we evaluate a simulation from 17 June 2012 to 16 June 2013 and conclude that, at 1-km horizontal grid spacing, the model captures the main features of observed meteorological variability in the catchment. The finer representation of the complex terrain and explicit simulation of convection at this grid spacing give strong improvements in near-surface air temperature and small improvements in precipitation, in particular in the magnitudes of daytime convective precipitation and at higher elevations. The seasonal differences are noteworthy, including a reversal in the vertical and along-valley distributions of precipitation between the monsoon and winter seasons, with peak values simulated at lower altitudes (~3000 m a.s.l) and in the upper regions (above 5000 m a.s.l.) in each season, respectively.

This study aims to evaluate the ability of a set of global impact models (GIMs) from the WaterMIP project to reproduce the regional hydrology of the central United States for the period 1963\u20132001. Hydrological indices describing annual daily maximum, medium and minimum flow and their timing are extracted from both modeled daily runoff data by nine GIMs and from observed daily streamflow measured at 252 river gauges. We compare trend patterns for these indices, and their ability to capture runoff volume differences for the 1988 drought and 1993 flood. In addition, we use a subset of 128 gauges and corresponding gridcells to perform a detailed evaluation of the models on a gauge-to-gridcell basis. Results indicate that these GIMs capture the overall trends in high, medium, and low flows well. However, the models differ from obervations with respect to the timing of high and medium flows. More specifically, GIMs that only include water balance tend to be closer to the observations than GIMs that also include the energy balance. In general, as it would be expected, the performance of the GIMs is the best when describing medium flows, as opposed to the two ends of the runoff spectrum. With regards to low flows, some of the GIMs having considerably large pools of zeros or low values in their time series, undermining their ability in capturing low flow characteristics and weakening the ensemble's output. Overall, this study provides a valuable examination of the capability of GIMs to reproduce observed regional hydrology over a range of quantities for the central United States.\n",

Here we analyze how well the autumn AR events with the highest probability for extreme precipitation over BC, henceforth called AR-extreme events, are simulated in five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) and how these AR-extreme events are projected to change by the end of the century. We examine the daily synoptic patterns of integrated water vapor transport (IVT) over the Pacific Ocean that favor the formation of AR-extreme events. Our analysis and comparison with AR-extreme events in four reanalysis products for the period 1979\u20132010 reveal that the GCMs more successfully resolve their seasonality and inter-annual variability than their frequencies and amount of precipitation brought to BC. For the CMIP5 scenario's RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the frequency of AR-extreme events will increase for the period 2070\u20132100 with the largest increase in December. All models project an increase in total precipitation over BC, due to the increase in frequency and intensity of the AR-extreme events, however, the dominant factor is the increase in frequency, especially of those events with precipitation exceeding 20 mm/day. The path of the ARs during the AR-extreme events is projected to move northward, bringing stronger IVT and more precipitation to the north coast of BC, while the south coast may become drier than at the present-day. The shift in the ARs is driven by the northward shift in the Aleutian Low Pressure System, especially in RCP8.5.\n",

In this study, flash rate parameterization schemes from the literature are evaluated against observed total flash rates for a sample of eleven Colorado thunderstorms, including nine storms from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment in May-June 2012. Observed flash rates were determined using an automated algorithm that clusters very high frequency (VHF) radiation sources emitted by electrical breakdown in clouds and detected by the northern Colorado lightning mapping array (LMA). Existing schemes were found to inadequately predict flash rates and were updated based on observed relationships between flash rate and simple storm parameters, yielding significant improvement. The most successful updated scheme predicts flash rate based on the radar-derived mixed-phase 35-dBZ echo volume. Parameterizations based on metrics for updraft-intensity were also updated but were found to be less reliable predictors of flash rate for this sample of storms. The 35-dBZ volume scheme was tested on a dataset containing radar reflectivity volume information for thousands of isolated convective cells in different regions of the US. This scheme predicted flash rates to within 5.8% of observed flash rates on average. These results encourage the application of this scheme to larger radar datasets and its possible implementation into cloud-resolving models.\n",

The size distribution was found to be typically bimodal with mode diameters and widths relatively stable throughout the year and the observation period. New particle formation was observed on 14.5% of all days without a seasonal preference. Particles typically grew only into the Aitken mode and did not reach cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes on the time scale of several days. Growth of pre-existing particles in the Aitken mode, on average, contributed very few CCN. We concluded that the dominant fraction of CCN at Jungfraujoch originated in the boundary layer. A number of approaches were used to distinguish free tropospheric (FT) conditions and episodes with planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence. In the absence of PBL injections, the concentration of particles larger than 90\u2009nm (N90, roughly corresponding to the CCN concentration) reached a value ~40\u2009cm\u22123 while PBL influence caused N90 concentrations of several hundred or even 1000\u2009cm\u22123. Comparing three criteria for free tropospheric conditions, we found FT prevalence for 39% of the time with over 60% during winter and below 20% during summer. It is noteworthy that a simple criterion based on standard trace gas measurements appeared to outperform alternative approaches.\n",

Congestus clouds act to moisten the tropical atmosphere, may be mixed-phase, and on occasion surpass the freezing level inversion from where they may develop into deeper convection. This study investigates the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the growth of congestus clouds produced in idealized cloud-resolving model simulations run under a state of radiative convective equilibrium (RCE). High resolution, long duration simulations were completed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Aerosol concentrations between 2 and 4\u2009km AGL were varied from clean to polluted conditions in order to represent the advection of Saharan dust over the Atlantic Ocean. The congestus populations within each aerosol simulation are statistically analyzed using ten days of model output after the simulation reaches RCE. Results indicate that congestus in more polluted conditions produce greater amounts of cloud water and ice mass, enhanced updraft strengths and an increase in the number of congestus cloud tops that extend above the freezing level. Enhanced vapor depositional growth on the populations of more numerous, smaller cloud droplets in the polluted conditions, and the subsequent increase in latent heat release in the warm phase regions of the cloud, are found to be important factors in convective invigoration of these cloud systems. Aerosol feedbacks associated with cold pools and condensate loading also influence the updraft strength, and act in opposition to the warm phase invigoration processes.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe wind velocity structure in the upper stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) is studied with the recently developed method of infrasound probing of the atmosphere. The method is based on the effect of infrasound scattering from highly anisotropic wind velocity and temperature inhomogeneities in the middle and upper atmosphere. The scattered infrasound field propagates in the acoustic shadow zones, where it is detected by microbarometers. The vertical profiles of the wind velocity fluctuations in the upper stratosphere (30\u201352 km) and MLT (90\u2013140 km) are retrieved from the wave forms and travel times of the infrasound signals generated by explosive sources such as volcanoes and surface explosions. The fine-scale wind layered structure in these layers was poorly observed until present time by other remote sensing methods, including radars and satellites. It is found that the MLT atmospheric layer (90\u2013102 km) can contain extremely high vertical gradients of the wind velocity, up to 10 m/s per 100 m. The effect of a fine-scale wind velocity structure on the wave forms of infrasound signals is studied. The vertical wavenumber spectra of the retrieved wind velocity fluctuations are obtained for the upper stratosphere. Despite the difference in the locations of the explosive sources all the obtained spectra show the existence of high vertical wavenumber spectral tail with a \u22123 power law decay. The obtained spectral characteristics of the wind fluctuations are necessary for improvement of gravity wave drag parametrizations for numerical weather forecast.\n",

We compare six different radiation management schemes that use surface, troposphere and stratosphere interventions in a single climate model in which we projected future climate from 2020 to 2099 based on RCP4.5. We analyze the surface air temperature responses to determine how effective the schemes are at returning temperature to its 1986-2005 climatology and analyze precipitation responses to compare side effects. We find crop albedo enhancement is largely ineffective at returning temperature to its 1986-2005 climatology. Desert albedo enhancement causes excessive cooling in the deserts and severe shifts in tropical precipitation. Ocean albedo enhancement, sea-spray geoengineering, cirrus cloud thinning and stratospheric SO2 injection have the potential to cool more uniformly, but cirrus cloud thinning may not be able to cool by much more than 1 K globally. We find that of the schemes potentially able to return surface air temperature to 1986-2005 climatology under future greenhouse gas warming, none has significantly less severe precipitation side effects than other schemes. Despite different forcing patterns, ocean albedo enhancement, sea-spray geoengineering, cirrus cloud thinning and stratospheric SO2 injection all result in large scale tropical precipitation responses caused by Hadley cell changes and land precipitation changes largely driven by thermodynamic changes. Widespread regional scale changes in precipitation over land are significantly different from the 1986-2005 climatology and would likely necessitate significant adaptation despite geoengineering.\n",

Recent studies have begun to consider channel length and flash size, which is now observable with VHF Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data. This study uses a capacitor model for flash energy based on the flash coverage area, which defines a size scale. This flash area is then filled with channel using a fractal method and compared to other methods that estimate length directly from the VHF source locations. In the presence of instrument measurement errors, area- and fractal-based estimates are shown to be more stable estimators of flash length and than connect-the-dots approaches, and therefore are better suited for comparison to NOx production. A geometric interpretation of using vertical profiles of VHF source density to weight the altitude distribution of total channel length is developed. An example of the time series of moments of the lightning flash size distribution is shown for an example case and some meteorological interpretation is given.\n",

This study examines the impact of precipitation assimilation on the representation of TCs in the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) before and after the 2004 introduction of precipitation assimilation over ocean in the vicinity of TCs. The probability distribution function of rainfall rates indicates that light (heavy) precipitation was overforecast (underforecast) in the early time period. Since the precipitation assimilation is applied through an adjustment to the latent heating distribution, the data assimilation system in the later time period initializes a low-level moisture and heating profile that is more conducive to the initiation of deep convection and the generation of precipitation. Consequently, the deep convection and enhanced latent heat release lead to a more robust warm core temperature perturbation and a better developed secondary circulation, which supplies the TC with larger quantities of moisture from the large-scale environment. Furthermore, the evolution of TC size, which was objectively estimated though the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), is significantly more skillful (p<0.05) in post-2003 storms. Based on this study, precipitation assimilation leads to a better analysis of temperature, winds, and moisture in the vicinity of TCs, resulting in improved representations of the water budget and storm lifecycle. Therefore, we conclude that efforts towards the development of precipitation assimilation techniques from radar and satellite datasets will be valuable toward the construction of improved TC forecasting tools with more authentic TC representation.\n",

The precipitation efficiency\u2014the ratio of the rates at which precipitation and condensation form (e\u2009=\u2009P/C)\u2014is useful for characterizing how much boundary layer moisture recycles through precipitation versus mixes into the free troposphere through cloud detrainment. Yet, it is a difficult metric to constrain with traditional observational techniques. This analysis characterizes the precipitation efficiency of convection near the Big Island of Hawaii, USA, using a novel tracer: isotope ratios in water vapor. The synoptic circulation patterns associated with high and low precipitation efficiency are identified, and the importance of large-scale dynamics and local convective processes in regulating vertical distributions of atmospheric constituents important for climate is evaluated. The results suggest high e days are correlated with plume-like transport originating from the relatively clean tropics, while low e days are associated with westerly transport, generated by a branching of the jet stream. Differences in transport pathway clearly modify background concentrations of water vapor and other trace gases measured at Mauna Loa Observatory; however, local convective processes appear to regulate aerosols there. Indeed, differences between observed and simulated diurnal cycles of particle number concentration indicate precipitation scavenges aerosols and possibly facilitates new particle formation when e is high. As measurements of isotope ratios in water vapor expand across the subtropics, the techniques presented here can further our understanding of how synoptic weather, precipitation processes, and climate feedbacks interrelate.\n",

We discuss the roles of meteorology, emissions, and transport from the stratosphere in driving the interannual variability in different regions and seasons. We demonstrate that a hindcast simulation for 1991\u20132010 can reproduce much of the observed variability and the trends in summertime ozone, with correlation coefficients for seasonally and regionally averaged median ozone ranging from 0.46 to 0.89. Reproducing the interannual variability in winter and spring in the western United States may require higher resolution models to adequately represent stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Hindcast simulations with fixed versus variable emissions show that changes in anthropogenic emissions drive the observed negative trends in monthly median ozone concentrations in the eastern United States during summer, as well as the observed reduction in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle. The simulation underestimates positive trends in the western United States during spring, but excluding the first four years of data removes many of the statistically significant trends in this region. The reduction in the slope of the ozone versus temperature relationship before and after major emission reductions is also well represented by the model. Our results indicate that a global model can reproduce many of the important features of the meteorologically induced ozone variability as well as the emission-driven trends, lending confidence to model projections of future changes in regional surface ozone.\n",

The most commonly-used cloud mask is a simple thematic classification, which includes qualitative information on the presence of clouds in the satellite's instantaneous field of view (IFOV). Cloud mask classes have to be \u2018translated\u2019 into a quantitative measure, in order to be used for cloud amount calculations. The assignment of cloud fractions to cloud mask classes is a subjective process, and increases uncertainty in cloud amount estimates. We evaluated this degree of uncertainty using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud mask product. Together with the operational MODIS cloud mask interpretation, we investigated two extreme alternatives: \u2018rigorous\u2019 (only \u2018confident cloudy\u2019 IFOVs were 100% cloudy), and \u2018tolerant\u2019 (only \u2018confident clear\u2019 IFOVs were 0% cloudy). Results showed that in Europe the range of uncertainty was 14.3% in Europe, and controlled by the frequency of small convective clouds. Comparison with surface-based observations suggests that the \u2018rigorous\u2019 interpretation of the cloud mask is more accurate than that used operationally for MODIS Level 3 product generation. The \u2018rigorous\u2019 approach resulted in the smallest bias (\u22120.7%), the smallest RMSE (4.6%), the small standard deviation (6%), and the strongest correlation (0.935). These results suggest that for climatological applications the \u2018rigorous\u2019 scenario should be considered as a more accurate \u2018best guess\u2019 over land.\n",

One decade observations are used to assess the performance of various MPEs (climate prediction center (CPC)-South Asia dataset, CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks (PERSIANN), tropical rainfall measuring mission's (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA-3B42) and global precipitation climatology project (GPCP)). All MPEs have high detection skills of rain with larger probability of detection (POD) and smaller \u2018misses\u2019 values. However, the detection sensitivity differs from one product (and also one region) to the other. While the CMORPH has the lowest sensitivity of detecting rain, CPC shows highest sensitivity and often over detects rain, as evidenced by large POD and false alarm ratio (FAR) and small \u2018misses\u2019 values. All MPEs show higher rain sensitivity over eastern India than western India. These differential sensitivities are found to alter the biases in rain amount differently. All MPEs show similar spatial patterns of seasonal rain bias and root mean square error (RMSE), but their spatial variability across India is complex and pronounced. The MPEs overestimate the rainfall over the dry regions (northwest and southeast India) and severely underestimate over mountainous regions (west coast and northeast India), whereas the bias is relatively small over the core monsoon zone. Higher occurrence of virga rain due to sub-cloud evaporation and possible missing of small-scale convective events by gauges over the dry regions are the main reasons for the observed overestimation of rain by MPEs. The decomposed components of total bias show that the major part of overestimation is due to false precipitation. The severe underestimation of rain along the west coast is attributed to the predominant occurrence of shallow rain and underestimation of moderate to heavy rain by MPEs. The decomposed components suggest that the missed precipitation and hit bias are the leading error sources for the total bias along the west coast. All evaluation metrics are found to be nearly equal in two contrasting monsoon seasons (southwest and northeast), indicating that the performance of MPEs doesn't change with the season, at least over southeast India. Among various MPEs, the performance of TMPA is found to be better than others, as it reproduced most of the spatial variability exhibited by the reference.\n",

Here, low clouds are defined as clouds with their tops below the freezing level and bases within the boundary layer. Low-cloud statistics in CAM5 simulations and ARM observations are compared in terms of their general occurrence, mean vertical profiles, fraction of precipitating vs. non-precipitating events, diurnal cycle, and monthly time series. Other types of clouds are included to put the comparison in a broader context. The comparison shows that the model overproduces total clouds and their precipitation fraction but underestimates low clouds in general. The model, however, produces excessive low clouds in a thin layer between 954\u2013930\u2009hPa, which coincides with excessive humidity near the top of the mixed layer. This suggests that the erroneously excessive low clouds stem from parameterization of both cloud and turbulence mixing. The model also fails to produce the observed diurnal cycle in low clouds, not exclusively due to the model coarse grid spacing that does not resolve Manus Island. This study demonstrates the utility of ARM long-term cloud observations in the tropical western Pacific in verifying low clouds simulated by global climate models, illustrates issues of using ARM observations in model validation, and provides an example of severe model biases in producing observed low clouds in the tropical western Pacific.\n",

A total number of 256 CAM5 simulations are conducted to quantify the model responses to the uncertain parameters associated with cloud microphysics parameterizations and aerosol (e.g., sulfate, black carbon (BC), and dust) emission factors and their interactions. Results show that the interaction terms among parameters are important for quantifying the sensitivity of fields of interest, especially precipitation, to the parameters. The relative importance of cloud-microphysics parameters and emission factors (strength) depends on evaluation metrics or the model fields we focused on, and the presence of uncertainty in cloud microphysics imposes an additional challenge in quantifying the impact of aerosols on cloud and climate.\nDue to their different optical and microphysical properties and spatial distributions, sulfate, BC, and dust aerosols have very different impacts on East Asian Monsoon through aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. The climatic effects of aerosol do not always have a monotonic response to the change of emission factors. The spatial patterns of both sign and magnitude of aerosol-induced changes in radiative fluxes, cloud, and precipitation could be different, depending on the aerosol types, when parameters are sampled in different ranges of values. We also identify the different cloud microphysical parameters that show the most significant impact on climatic effect induced by sulfate, BC and dust, respectively, in East Asia.\n",

Results show that when increased aerosol loading is found on the Himalayas slopes in the pre-monsoon period (April-May), intensification of early monsoon rainfall over India and increased low-level westerly flow follow, in agreement with the Elevated-Heat-Pump mechanism. The increase in rainfall during the early monsoon season has a cooling effect on the land surface. In the same period, enhanced surface cooling may also be amplified through solar dimming by more cloudiness and aerosol loading, via increased dust transported by low-level westerly flow. The surface cooling causes subsequent reduction in monsoon rainfall in July-August over India. The time-lagged nature of the reasonably realistic response of the model to aerosol forcing suggests that absorbing aerosols, besides their potential key roles in impacting monsoon water cycle and climate, may influence the seasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon.\n",

When it is possible, the results are provided separately for low-, middle- and high-level clouds. The microphysical parameterizations assessed are: WRF single-moment 6-class, Thompson, Milbrandt-Yau, Morrison, Stony Brook University and National Severe Storms Laboratory double-moment. The evaluated macroscopic cloud properties are determined based on the model cloud fractions. Two cloud fraction approaches, namely, a binary and a continuous cloud fraction, are investigated. Model cloud cover is determined by overlapping the vertically distributed cloud fractions following three different strategies. The evaluation is conducted based on observations gathered with a ceilometer and a sky camera located in Ja\u00e9n (southern Spain). The results prove that the reliability of the WRF model mostly depends on the considered cloud parameter, cloud level and spatio-temporal resolution. In our testbed, it is found that WRF model tends to (i) over-predict the occurrence of high-level clouds irrespectively of the spatial resolution (ii) under-estimate the cloud base height and (iii) over-estimate the cloud cover. Overall, the best cloud estimates are found for finer spatial resolutions (1.3 and 4 km with slight differences between them) and coarser temporal resolutions.

Robust and significant solar signals are detected in Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT) and strong solar activity evidently warms most area of the continent. The spatial pattern of sea level pressure (SLP) responses to solar activity is similar but not identical to that of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Compared to the NAO, geographic distribution of solar-induced SLP anomalies shifts eastward, with significantly enhanced influences over northern Eurasia. Relatively weaker solar signals were also found in mid-to-upper troposphere. The spatial pattern of 500 hPa geopotential anomalies resembles a negative Scandinavia Teleconnection pattern and the 200 hPa subtropical jet is weakened, while zonal wind at high latitudes is enhanced due to strong solar activity.\nThe anomalous zonal circulations can be attributed to the \u201ctop-down\u201d mechanism. During high solar activity winters, an enhanced stratospheric zonal wind anomaly propagates downward, causing zonal wind anomalies in the troposphere. However, the \u201cbottom-up\u201d mechanisms may provide more reasonable explanations of the distinct solar influences on Eurasian climate. Solar-induced strong warm advection in lower atmosphere tends to increase SAT but decrease SLP, resulting in enhanced solar influences over northern Eurasia. Meanwhile, change in the land-ocean thermal contrast (LOTC) could also amplify the circulation anomaly. Inhomogeneous surface heating caused by anomalous solar activity modifies LOTC, which probably enhances the solar-induced circulation patterns. Such a positive feedback may potentially strengthen the solar influences.\n",

Numerical experiments are conducted with forest canopy structures spanning from bare ground to dense canopies and terrain configurations ranging from small, shallow valleys to broad, deep valleys. In a set of experiments in which forest canopy density is varied, the minimum potential temperature in the cold-air pool is found to be as much as 15K warmer with a dense canopy than with no canopy. Analysis of the thermodynamic budget reveals weaker cooling rates in the dense canopy case than the sparse canopy case, with differences in cooling rates persisting through the duration of the simulation. An additional experiment in which cooling of canopy elements and the influence of the canopy on the ground radiation budget are neglected highlights the important role the canopy plays in limiting radiative loss from the ground surface along the sidewall and valley floor. In experiments in which valley geometry is varied, the cold-air pool is found to be strongest in a medium valley (10\u2009km wide, 187.5\u2009m deep), and weakest in a small valley (2\u2009km wide, 37.5\u2009m deep).

Changes in SSA size distributions occurred during all phases of bacterial and phytoplankton growth, as characterized by cell concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total particulate carbon (TPC), and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP, gel-forming polysaccharides representing a major component of biogenic exudate material). Over a 2 week growth period, SSA particle concentrations increased by a factor of less than 2 when only bacteria were present and by a factor of about 3 when bacteria and phytoplankton were present. Production of jet generated SSA particles of diameter less than 200 nm increased with time, while production of all particle diameters increased with time when frits were used. The implications of a marine biological activity dependent SSA flux are discussed.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe OSIRIS instrument on the Odin satellite, launched in 2001 and currently operational, measures limb scattered sunlight from which profiles of stratospheric aerosol extinction are retrieved. SAGE II was launched in 1984 and provided measurements of stratospheric aerosol extinction until mid 2005. This provides approximately four years of mission overlap which has allowed us to consistently extend the SAGE II version 7.00 record to the present using OSIRIS aerosol extinction retrievals. In this work we first compare coincident aerosol extinction observations during the overlap period by interpolating the SAGE II 525nm and 1020nm channels to the OSIRIS extinction wavelength of 750nm. In the tropics to mid latitudes mean differences are typically less than 10%, although larger biases are seen at higher latitudes and at altitudes outside the main aerosol layer. OSIRIS aerosol extinction retrievals at 750nm are used to create a monthly time series zonally averaged in 5 degree bins and qualitatively compared to SAGE II 525nm observations averaged in the same way. The OSIRIS time series is then translated to 525nm with an Angstrom exponent relation and bias corrected. For most locations, this provides agreement during the overlap time period to better than 15%. Uncertainty in the resulting OSIRIS time series is estimated through a series of simulation studies over the range of aerosol particle size distributions observed by in-situ balloon instruments, and is found to be approximately 20% for background and moderately volcanic aerosol loading conditions for the majority of OSIRIS measurement conditions.\n",

The observed concentration of total gaseous Hg (TGM) was 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009ng\u2009m\u22123. During the sampling period, gaseous oxidized Hg and particulate bound Hg were 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 and 180\u2009\u00b1\u2009110\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 in winter and 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 and 130\u2009\u00b1\u2009100\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 in spring, respectively. The relatively high mean concentration of TGM was mainly caused by regional anthropogenic emissions and occasional long-range transport from domestic source regions. Seasonal variation in the TGM concentration was observed with lower values in the wet monsoon season (from May to September) and higher values in the dry monsoon season (from October to April). Backward trajectories and potential source contribution function analysis suggested that anthropogenic Hg emission from coal combustion in the Yangtze River Delta region was the most likely cause for the elevated TGM concentrations. Relatively clean air originating from the East China Sea was the most possible cause for the observed low TGM concentrations. Positive correlation between TGM concentration and air quality index suggests that emissions that influenced regional air quality contributed to the elevated TGM concentrations.\n",

In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a cooler and stronger Antarctic stratosphere, while the stratospheric ozone recovery has the opposite effects. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the impacts of the stratospheric ozone depletion on polar stratospheric temperature are not opposite to that of the stratospheric ozone recovery; i.e., the stratospheric ozone depletion causes a weak cooling and the stratospheric ozone recovery causes a statistically significant cooling. The stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a weakening of the Arctic polar vortex, while the stratospheric ozone recovery leads to a strengthening of the Arctic polar vortex. The cooling of the Arctic polar vortex is found to be dynamically induced via modulating the planetary wave activity by stratospheric ozone increases. Particularly interesting is that stratospheric ozone changes have opposite effects on the stationary and transient wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere. The analysis of the wave refractive index and Eliassen-Palm flux in the NH indicates (1) that the wave refraction in the stratosphere cannot fully explain wave flux changes in the Arctic stratosphere and (2) that stratospheric ozone changes can cause changes in wave propagation in the northern midlatitude troposphere which in turn affect wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere. In the SH, the radiative cooling (warming) caused by stratospheric ozone depletion (recovery) produces a larger (smaller) meridional temperature gradient in the midlatitude upper troposphere, accompanied by larger (smaller) zonal wind vertical shear and larger (smaller) vertical gradients of buoyancy frequency. Hence, there are more (fewer) transient waves propagating into the stratosphere. The dynamical warming (cooling) caused by stratospheric ozone decreases (increases) partly offsets their radiative cooling (warming).\n",

Systematic comparisons between observations, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analyses including the recent Integrated Forecast System cycles 38r1 and 38r2, the NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalyses, and the free-running climate Max Planck Institute\u2013Earth System Model\u2013Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) are carried out in both temporal and spectral domains. We find that ECMWF and MERRA are broadly consistent with lidar and wind radiometer measurements up to ~40\u2009km. For both temperature and horizontal wind components, deviations increase with altitude as the assimilated observations become sparser. Between 40 and 60\u2009km altitude, the standard deviation of the mean difference exceeds 5\u2009K for the temperature and 20\u2009m/s for the zonal wind. The largest deviations are observed in winter when the variability from large-scale planetary waves dominates. Between lidar data and MPI-ESM-LR, there is an overall agreement in spectral amplitude down to 15\u201320\u2009days. At shorter time scales, the variability is lacking in the model by ~10\u2009dB. Infrasound observations indicate a general good agreement with ECWMF wind and temperature products. As such, this study demonstrates the potential of the infrastructure of the Atmospheric Dynamics Research Infrastructure in Europe project that integrates various measurements and provides a quantitative understanding of stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling for numerical weather prediction applications.\n",

Scavenging ratios of particulate inorganic ions (K+ and Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+) were used as a surrogate for those of FPBM and CPBM, respectively. FPBM and CPBM were estimated to contribute 8\u201336% and 5\u201327%, respectively, depending on the location, to total wet deposition. The rest of the 39\u201387% was attributed to the contribution of GOM. The average %GOM, %FPBM and %CPBM among all locations were 65%, 17%, and 18%, respectively. The relative distributions of %GOM, %FPBM, and %CPBM were influenced by Hg(II) gas-particle partitioning, urban site characteristics, and precipitation type. At the regional scale, %GOM dominated over %FPBM and %CPBM. However, the sum of FPBM and CPBM contributed to nearly half of the total Hg wet deposition in urban areas, which was greater than other site categories and is attributed to higher FPBM air concentrations. At four locations, %FPBM exceeded %GOM during winter in contrast to summer, suggesting the efficient snow scavenging of aerosols. The results from this study are useful in improving mercury transport models since most of these models do not estimate CPBM, but frequently use monitored mercury wet deposition data for model evaluation.\n",

However, the understanding of drought mechanism and predictability is limited. Based on the hindcasts from multiple climate models, the predictability and forecast skill for drought over China are investigated. The 3\u2009month standardized precipitation index is used as the drought index, and the predictability is quantified by using a perfect model assumption. Ensemble hindcasts from multiple climate models are assessed individually, and the grand multimodel ensemble is also evaluated. Drought forecast skill for model ensemble mean is higher than individual ensemble members, and North American Multimodel Ensemble grand ensemble performs the best. Predictability is higher than forecast skill, indicating the room for improving drought forecast. Drought predictability and forecast skill are positively correlated in general, but they vary depending on seasons, regions, and forecast leads. Higher drought predictability and forecast skill are found over regimes where ENSO has significant impact. For the ENSO-affected regimes, both drought predictability and forecast skill in ENSO years are higher than that in neutral years. This study suggests that predictability not only provides a measure for selecting climate models for ensemble drought forecast in ENSO-affected regimes but also serves as an indicator for forecast skill especially when in situ and/or remote sensing measurements for the hindcast verifications are considered unreliable.\n",

The VIC model resolved the seasonal cycle and temporal evolution of the observed soil temperatures and liquid soil moisture well. The simulated long-term changes during 1962\u20132009 indicated mostly positive trends for both soil temperature and soil moisture, and negative trends for soil ice content at annual and monthly time scales, although differences existed among the stations, soil layers, and seasons. Increases in soil temperature were due mainly to increases in daily air temperature maxima and internal soil heat conduction, while decreases in soil ice content were related to the warming of frozen soil. For liquid soil moisture, increases in the cold months can be attributed to increases in soil temperature and enhanced soil ice melt while changes in the warm months were the results of competition between positive precipitation and negative soil temperature effects. Precipitation and liquid soil moisture were strongly correlated with evapotranspiration and runoff but had various degrees of correlations with base flow during May\u2013September. Seasonally frozen stations displayed longer and more active hydrological processes than permafrost stations. Slight enhancement of the surface hydrological processes at the study stations was indicated, due to the combined effects of precipitation changes, which were dominant, and frozen soil degradation.\n",

During the warm season, observations and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change global climate models generally support a \u201cwet gets wetter, dry gets drier\u201d hypothesis in these regions, which acts to amplify the climatological transitions in the context of the annual cycle. In this study, we consider changes in U.S. early warm season precipitation in the observational record and regional climate model simulations driven by two \u201cwell-performing\u201d dynamically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) models (Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and Max Planck Institute (MPI) European Centre/Hamburg Model 5) that have a robust climatological representation of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). Both observations and model results show amplification in historical seasonal transitions of temperature and precipitation associated with NAMS development, with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-MPI better representing the observed signal. Assuming the influence of remote Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) forcing associated with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Variability (ENSO-PDV) on U.S. regional climate remains the same in the 21st century, similar extreme trends are also projected by WRF-MPI for the next 30\u2009years. A methodology is also developed to objectively analyze how climate change may be synergistically interacting with ENSO-PDV variability during the early warm season. Our analysis suggests that interannual variability of warm season temperature and precipitation associated with Pacific SST forcing is becoming more extreme, and the signal is stronger in the observed record.\n",

Coincident OPC and SAGE II measurements are compared for a volcanic (1991\u20131996) and nonvolcanic (1997\u20132005) period. OPC calculated extinctions agree with SAGE II measurements, within instrumental uncertainty, during the volcanic period, but have been a factor of 2 low during the nonvolcanic period. Three systematic errors associated with the OPC measurements, anisokineticity, inlet particle evaporation, and counting efficiency, were investigated. An overestimation of the OPC counting efficiency is found to be the major source of systematic error. With this correction OPC calculated extinction increases by 15\u201330% (30\u201350%) for the volcanic (nonvolcanic) measurements. These changes significantly improve the comparison with SAGE II and HALOE extinctions in the nonvolcanic cases but slightly degrade the agreement in the volcanic period. These corrections have impacts on OPC-derived surface area density, exacerbating the poor agreement between OPC and SAGE II (version 6.2) surface areas. This disparity is reconciled with SAGE II version 7.0 surface areas. For both the volcanic and nonvolcanic cases these changes in OPC counting efficiency and in the operational SAGE II surface area algorithm leave the derived surface areas from both platforms in significantly better agreement and within the \u00b1\u200940% precision of the OPC moment calculations.\n",

A new passive-tracer-based transport analysis framework is developed to characterize convective transport using vertical profiles of several passive trace gases. For this case, the analysis estimates that observed passive gas mixing ratios in the upper troposphere convective outflow consist of 47% low level (<3\u2009km) inflow air, 32% entrained midtroposphere air, and 21% upper troposphere air. The new analysis framework is used to estimate aerosol wet scavenging efficiencies. Observations yield high overall scavenging efficiencies of 81% for submicron aerosol mass. Organic, sulfate, and ammonium aerosols have similar wet scavenging efficiencies (80%\u201384%). The apparent scavenging efficiency for nitrate aerosol is much lower (57%), but the scavenging efficiency for nitrate aerosol plus nitric acid combined (84%) is close to the other species. Scavenging efficiencies for aerosol number are high for larger particles (84% for 0.15\u20132.5\u2009\u00b5m diameter) but are lower for smaller particles (64% for 0.03\u20130.15\u2009\u00b5m). The storm is simulated using the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Compared to the observation-based analysis, the standard model strongly underestimates aerosol scavenging efficiencies by 32% and 41% in absolute differences for submicron mass and number. Adding a new treatment of secondary activation significantly improves simulated aerosol scavenging, producing wet scavenging efficiencies that are only 7% and 8% lower than observed efficiencies. This finding emphasizes the importance of secondary activation for aerosol wet removal in deep convective storms.\n",

The WRF model was driven by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with the Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics component (GFDL-ESM2G) output over China at the resolution of 30\u2009km for the present day (1976\u20132005) and near future (2031\u20132050) under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. The results demonstrate that with improved resolution and better representation of finer-scale physical process, dynamical downscaling adds value to the regional precipitation simulation. WRF downscaling generally simulates more reliable spatial distributions of total precipitation and extreme precipitation in China with higher spatial pattern correlations and closer magnitude. It is able to successfully eliminate the artificial precipitation maximum area simulated by GFDL-ESM2G over the west of the Sichuan Basin, along the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in both summer and winter. Besides, the regional annual cycle and frequencies of precipitation intensity are also well depicted by WRF. In the future projections, under the RCP4.5 scenario, both models project that summer precipitation over most parts of China will increase, especially in western and northern China, and that precipitation over some southern regions is projected to decrease. The projected increase of future extreme precipitation makes great contributions to the total precipitation increase. In southern regions, the projected larger extreme precipitation amounts accompanied with fewer extreme precipitation frequencies suggest that future daily extreme precipitation intensity is likely to increase in these regions.\n",

The multiyear aerosol extinction assessment indicates that aerosols, mainly biomass burning particles emitted during the dry season in the Amazon Basin, are lifted in significant amounts over the Andes. The aerosols are mainly transported in the planetary boundary layer between the surface and 2\u00a0km altitude with an aerosol extinction maximum near the surface. During the transport toward the Andes, the aerosol extinction decreases at a rate of 0.02\u00a0km\u22121 per kilometer of altitude likely due to dilution and deposition processes. Aerosols reaching the top of the Andes, at altitudes typically between 4 and 5\u00a0km, are entrained into the free troposphere (FT) over the southeast Pacific Ocean. A comparison between CALIOP observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis data indicates that during their long-range transport over the tropical Pacific Ocean, these aerosols are slowly transported toward the marine boundary layer by the large-scale subsidence at a rate of 0.4\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u22121. The observed vertical/horizontal transport ratio is 0.7\u20130.8\u00a0m\u00a0km\u22121. Continental aerosols linked to transport over the Andes can be traced on average over 4000\u00a0km away from the continent indicating an aerosol residence time of 8\u20139\u00a0days in the FT over the Pacific Ocean. The FT aerosol optical depth (AOD) above the Pacific Ocean near South American coast accounts on average for 6% and 25% of the total AOD during the season of low and high biomass burning, respectively. This result shows that, during the biomass burning season, continental aerosols largely influence the AOD over the remote southeast Pacific Ocean. Overall, FT AOD decrease exponentially with the distance to continental sources at a rate of about 10% per degree of longitude over the Pacific Ocean.\n",

California has a well-pronounced rain season that peaks in December\u2013February. However, the 95% confidence interval around the climatological precipitation during these months imply that deviations on the order of 60% of the expected amounts are very likely during the most important period of the rain season. While these positive and negative anomalies alternate almost every year and tend to cancel each other, severe multiyear declines of precipitation in California appear on decadal scales. The 1986\u20131994 decline of precipitation was similar to the current one that started in 2011 and is apparent in the reanalysis data. In terms of accumulated deficits of precipitation, that episode was no less severe than the current one. While El Ni\u00f1o (the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, ENSO) is frequently cited as the natural forcing expected to bring a relief from drought, our assessment is that ENSO has been driving at best only 6% of precipitation variability in California in the past three decades. Using fractional risk analysis of precipitation during typical versus drying periods, we show that the likelihood of losing the most intensive precipitation events drastically increases during the multiyear drying events. Storms delivering up to 50% of the precipitation in California are driven by atmospheric rivers making landfall. However, these phenomena can be suppressed and even blocked by persistent ridges of atmospheric pressure in the northeast Pacific. The reanalysis and satellite data are proven to be reliable to the extent where they yield information on developing conditions and observed precipitation anomalies.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA new approach to parameterizing the modulation of aerosol scavenging by electric charges on particles and droplets gives improved accuracy and is applied over an extended range of droplet and particle radii relevant to cloud microphysical processes. The base level scavenging rates for small particles are dominated by diffusion and for large particles by intercept, weight, and flow effects. For charged particles encountering uncharged droplets, in all cases there is an increase in the scavenging rates, due to the image force. For droplets with charges of opposite sign to those of the particle charge, the rates are further increased, due to the Coulomb force, whereas for droplet with charges of the same sign, the rates are decreased. Increases above the base level (electroscavenging) predominate for the larger particles and occur in the interior of clouds even when no space charge (net charge) is present. Decreases below the base level (electroantiscavenging) occur for same-sign charges with smaller particles. The rates for uncharged droplets are parameterized, and the effect of charges on the droplets then parameterized as a departure from those rates. The results are convenient for incorporation in models of clouds which include detailed microphysics, to model the electrically induced reductions and increases in cloud condensation nucleus and ice forming nucleus concentrations and size distributions and contact ice nucleation rates that affect coagulation and precipitation and cloud albedo. Implications for effects on weather and climate, due both to externally and internally induced variability in atmospheric ionization, are outlined.\n",

        "description": "\n\nCorrelations of 1\u00b0 by 1\u00b0 seasonal rainfall with Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reveal spatially distinct teleconnections between El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall over the full monsoon season, as well as three subseasons. Over the full season (June\u2013September), Pacific SSTs correlate with rainfall in Western India more than that in Eastern India. This spatial signature shifts as the monsoon progresses through early (June), middle or peak (July\u2013August), and late (September) subseasons. Specifically, a 1\u00b0C cooling of the central equatorial Pacific (i.e., La Ni\u00f1a conditions) can result in the following: \u223c70\u2013100% increase in precipitation in north central Indian and the Indo-Gangetic Plains during the early season, \u223c30\u201380% increase peak season precipitation in south central India and northwestern Rajasthan, and \u223c60\u2013100% increase in late season precipitation in northern, northwestern, and central India. Furthermore, the spatial signatures between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o are asymmetric in that for a particular location, the enhancement and suppression of rainfall associated with La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions, respectively, are not equal. El Ni\u00f1o suppresses peak season rainfall in the south central and northwestern Rajasthan regions more than La Ni\u00f1a enhances it, but the opposite occurs during the late season in northern, northwestern, and central India. Additionally, the correspondence of minima (maxima) in anomalies of velocity potential aloft with maxima (minima) at 925\u00a0mb and with positive (negative) surface pressure anomalies suggests that anomalous subsidence (ascent) occurs in July\u2013September during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) times. In the early season, however, patterns of velocity potential composites suggest a region of descent (ascent) over the western equatorial Indian Ocean, along with a region of ascent (descent) over the Indian subcontinent that exists only during the early season but not during the peak or late season. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that local Hadley cell circulation affects pressure and thus rainfall during the early season but that a larger-scale mechanism, such as eastward or westward shifts in the Walker circulation, may be more responsible for teleconnections seen throughout the remainder of the season. These findings indicate that focusing monsoon forecasting efforts on these regions and on subseasonal periods while incorporating ENSO asymmetries will yield useful and skillful regional forecasts, compared to the declining utility and skill of all-India summer monsoon rainfall.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWhile it is established that low-frequency climate variability modes have a dominant role on Australia's climate, limited work to date has focused on relationships between climate variability and Australian heatwaves. Moreover, heatwaves are a distinctive type of extreme weather that can be classified by multiple characteristics, such as intensity, frequency, duration, and timing. This study identifies the relationships between known modes of climate variability that influence Australian climate, and discrete seasonal characteristics of the intensity, frequency, duration, and timing of heatwaves. The large-scale seasonal modes of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are investigated for extended Austral summers commencing between the years 1911 and 2012. While ENSO is found to have the strongest relationship with Australian heatwave characteristics, this study finds that ENSO's influence differs between heatwave frequency, duration, intensity, and timing. Regions dominated by ENSO experience more, longer lasting and hotter heatwaves combined with an earlier commencement of the heatwave season during El Ni\u00f1o phases. The exception to this is southeast Australia, where SAM is generally more dominant. In contrast, the IOD provides little indication of seasonal heatwave characteristics due to its relative inactivity during the Austral summer months. Lastly, we show that antecedent soil moisture has varying strengths of relationships with Australian heatwave characteristics, exhibiting relationships with heatwave intensity and timing over some regions where none are detected between large-scale modes. However, while significant relationships between dry antecedent soil moisture and extreme heatwaves do exist over Australia, these appear to be slightly weaker than similar relationships over Europe reported in other studies.\n",

The main purpose of the algorithm is to derive aerosol height information over wide areas using aerosol products from multiple satellite sensors simultaneously: aerosol optical depth (AOD) and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), UV aerosol index from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and total backscatter coefficient profile from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The case studies suggest that the ASHE algorithm performs well for both smoke and dust aerosols, showing root-mean-square error of the retrieved aerosol height as compared to CALIOP observations from 0.58 to 1.31\u2009km and mean bias from \u22120.70 to 1.13\u2009km. In addition, the algorithm shows the ability to retrieve single-scattering albedo to within 0.03 of Aerosol Robotic Network inversion data for moderate to thick aerosol loadings (AOD of ~1.0). For typical single-layered aerosol cases, the estimated uncertainty in the retrieved height ranges from 1.20 to 1.80\u2009km over land and from 1.15 to 1.58\u2009km over ocean when favorable conditions are met. Larger errors are observed for multilayered aerosol events, due to the limited sensitivities of the passive sensors to such cases.\n",

The modeled global dust cycle is enhanced at the LGM, with larger emissions in the Southern Hemisphere, consistent with some previous studies. Two different dust uplift schemes within HadGEM2 both show a similar LGM/PI increase in total emissions (60% and 80%) and global loading (100% and 75%), but there is a factor of 3 difference in the top of the atmosphere net LGM-PI direct radiative forcing (\u22121.2\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122 and \u22120.4\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122, respectively). This forcing is dominated by the short-wave effects in both schemes. Recent reconstructions of dust deposition fluxes suggest that the LGM increase is overestimated in the Southern Atlantic and underestimated over east Antarctica. The LGM dust deposition reconstructions do not strongly discern between these two dust schemes because deposition is dominated by larger (2\u20136\u00a0m diameter) particles for which the two schemes show similar loading in both time periods. The model with larger radiative forcing shows a larger relative emissions increase of smaller particles. This is because of the size-dependent friction velocity emission threshold and different size distribution of the soil source particles compared with the second scheme. Size dependence of the threshold velocity is consistent with the theory of saltation, implying that the model with larger radiative forcing is more realistic. However, the large difference in radiative forcing between the two schemes highlights the size distribution at emission as a major uncertainty in predicting the climatic effects of dust cycle changes.\n",

High-resolution land use data for Beijing in 2010 with modified urban parameterization were introduced into the model. Evaluation showed that the simulation result generally agreed well with observations. Two sensitivity tests with different urban high-resolution land use scenarios were employed to analyze the impact of urban expansion on this rainfall event. The simulation results confirmed that urbanization expansion played an important role in the distribution and intensity of precipitation for this extreme event. Urbanization led to total precipitation increasing in upstream and downstream directions. The start time of the precipitation process was advanced by 1\u2009h, and the duration became longer due to the influence of urbanization. Moreover, urbanization caused the spatial distribution of precipitation to become more concentrated. The total precipitation amount above 250\u2009mm and the frequency of precipitation intensity above 40\u2009h\u22121\u2009mm are both increased. The results of this study show that urbanization plays a significant role in frontal-type rainfall.\n",

Particulate OS levels are highest in summertime and generally increase as a function of sulfate (a precursor) and sodium (a marine tracer) with peak levels at coastal sites. The ratio of OS to total sulfur is also highest at coastal sites, with increasing values as a function of normalized difference vegetation index and the ratio of organic carbon to elemental carbon. Correlative analysis points to significant relationships between OS and biogenic emissions from marine and continental sources, factors that coincide with secondary production, and vanadium due to a suspected catalytic role. A major OS species, methanesulfonate (MSA), was examined with intensive field measurements, and the resulting data support the case for vanadium's catalytic influence. Mass size distributions reveal a dominant MSA peak between aerodynamic diameters of 0.32\u20130.56\u2009\u00b5m at a desert and coastal site with nearly all MSA mass (\u226584%) in submicrometer sizes; MSA:non-sea-salt sulfate ratios vary widely as a function of particle size and proximity to the ocean. Airborne data indicate that relative to the marine boundary layer, particulate MSA levels are enhanced in urban and agricultural areas and also the free troposphere when impacted by biomass burning. Some combination of fires and marine-derived emissions leads to higher MSA levels than either source alone. Finally, MSA differences in cloud water and out-of-cloud aerosol are discussed.\n",

In this study, three numerical experiments are carried out. The first is the control and includes no assimilation; in the second, named Conv, assimilation of conventional Global Telecommunication System data is performed. The third one, named ConvAIRS, is identical to the Conv except that it also includes assimilation of AIRS profiles. The initial fields of tropospheric temperature and water vapor mixing ratio showed significant improvement over the model domain. Assimilation of AIRS profiles has significant impact on predicting the seasonal mean monsoon characteristics such as tropospheric temperature, low-level moisture distribution, easterly wind shear, and precipitation. The vertical structure of the root-mean-square error is substantially affected by the assimilation of AIRS profiles, with smaller errors in temperature, humidity, and wind magnitude. The consequent improved representation of moisture convergence in the boundary layer (deep convection as well) causes an increase in precipitation forecast skill. The fact that the monsoonal circulation is better captured, thanks to an improved representation of thermal gradients, which in turn leads to more realistic moisture transport, is particularly noteworthy. Several previous data impact studies with AIRS and other sensors have focused on the short or medium range of the forecast. The demonstrated improvement in all the predicted fields associated with the Indian summer monsoon, consequent to the month long assimilation of AIRS profiles, is an innovative finding with large implications to the operational seasonal forecasting capabilities over the Indian subcontinent.\n",

Global mean LNOx production rates of 0 to 492\u2009mol NO flash\u22121 and the subsequent responses of NOx, ozone (O3), hydroxyl radical (OH), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and NOy (NOx\u2009+\u2009HNO3\u2009+\u2009PAN) are investigated. The radiative implications associated with LNOx-induced changes in tropospheric O3 are assessed. Increasing the LNOx production rate by a factor of 4 (from 123 to 492\u2009mol flash\u22121) leads to tropical upper tropospheric enhancements of greater than 100% in NOx, OH, HNO3, and PAN. This increase in LNOx production also leads to O3 enhancements of up to 60%, which subsequently yields a factor-of-three increase in the mean net radiative flux at the tropopause. An LNOx source of 246\u2009mol flash\u22121 agrees reasonably well with measurements, with an approximate factor-of-two uncertainty due to the short length of the study, inconsistencies in the observational data sets, and systematic biases in modeled LNOx production. Further research into the regional dependencies of lightning flash rates and LNOx production per flash, along with improvements in satellite retrievals, should help resolve the discrepancies that currently exist between the model and observations.\n",

The relationship between the inhomogeneity and the model grid size as well as atmospheric condition is presented. A larger grid scale and more unstable atmosphere are associated with larger inhomogeneity that is described by a smaller shape parameter. This relationship is implemented as a scale-aware parameterization of the liquid cloud inhomogeneity in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which the shape parameter impacts the cloud microphysical processes. When used in the default CESM1 with the finite-volume dynamic core where a constant liquid inhomogeneity parameter was assumed, it reduces the cloud inhomogeneity in high latitudes and increases it in low latitudes. This is due to both the smaller (larger) grid size in high (low) latitudes in the longitude-latitude grid setting of CESM and the more stable (unstable) atmosphere. The single-column model and general circulation model sensitivity experiments show that the new parameterization increases the cloud liquid water path in polar regions and decreases it in low latitudes. An advantage of the parameterization is that it can recognize the spatial resolutions of the CESM without special tuning of the cloud water inhomogeneity parameter.\n",

The tropopause-based vertical coordinate is used for the TIL detection, and for meticulously studying the IGW variation around the TIL, the broad spectral method is used for the IGW extraction. Generally, the TIL at the midlatitude station is stronger and thicker in winter and spring, which is consistent with previous studies. Our study confirmed the intense interaction between the TIL and IGW. It is found that the TIL not only could inhibit the upward propagation of IGWs from below but also imply the possible excitation links between the TIL and IGW. The results also indicate that the enhanced wind shear layer just 1\u2009km above the tropopause may result in instability and finally leads to the IGW breaking and intensive turbulence. Subsequently, the IGW-induced intensive turbulence leads to strong wave energy dissipation and a downward heat flux. This downward heat transportation could significantly cool the tropopause, while it has only negligible thermal effect on the atmosphere above the tropopause. Then, the IGW-induced cooling at the tropopause makes the tropopause colder and sharper and finally forms the TIL. These suggest besides previously proposed mechanisms that IGWs also contribute greatly to the formation of TIL, which is consistent with a recent related simulation study.\n",

Based on comparison with AE estimates calculated using the Budyko equation, all five reanalysis data sets reasonably reproduce the spatial patterns of AE over China, with a clearly southeast-northwest gradient. Overall, JRA-55 (NCEP-DOE) gives the lowest (highest) reanalysis evaporation (RE) values. From 1979 to 2013, dominant modes of RE among five reanalyses are extracted using multivariate empirical orthogonal function analysis. Accordingly, the interdecadal variation of RE is likely driven by the change of temperature, and the interannual variation is constrained by the water supply conditions. Under climate warming, RE increase in the Northwest China, Yangtze-Huaihe river basin, and South China, while they decrease in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and northern and Northeast China. Moreover, the relationship between RE and pan evaporation (PE) are comprehensively evaluated in space-time. Negative correlations are generally confirmed in nonhumid environments, while positive correlations exist in the humid regions. Our analysis supports the interpretation that the relationship between PE and AE was complementary with water control and proportional with energy control. In view of data availability, important differences in spatial variability and the amount of RE can be found in Northwest China, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the Yangtze River Basin. Generally speaking, NCEP-NCAR and MERRA have substantial problems on describing the long-term change of RE; however, there are some inaccuracies in the JRA-55 estimates when focusing on the year-to-year variation.\n",

MODIS leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and albedo are incorporated into the Pleim-Xiu land surface model (PX LSM) used in a combined meteorology and air quality modeling system. The current PX LSM intentionally exaggerates vegetation coverage and LAI in western dry lands so that its soil moisture nudging scheme is more effective in simulating surface temperature and mixing ratio. Reduced vegetation coverage from the PX LSM with MODIS input results in hotter and dryer daytime conditions with reduced ozone dry deposition velocities in much of western North America. Evaluations of the new system indicate greater error and bias in temperature, but reduced error and bias in moisture with the MODIS vegetation input. Hotter daytime temperatures and reduced dry deposition result in greater ozone concentrations in the western arid regions even with deeper boundary layer depths. MODIS albedo has much less impact on the meteorology simulations than MODIS LAI and FPAR. The MODIS vegetation and albedo input does not have much influence in the east where differences in vegetation and albedo parameters are less extreme. Evaluation results showing increased temperature errors with more accurate representation of vegetation suggests that improvements are needed in the model surface physics, particularly the soil processes in the PX LSM.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe temperature difference between the surface and the air (dTsa) directly indicates the intensity and heat fluxes of land-atmosphere interaction. Considering the effects of surface characteristics and air condition on the surface temperature, using 1\u2009km data from the MOD02 thermal infrared bands of the EOS/moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on satellite Aqua, other MODIS products and temperatures observed from weather stations at 14:00\u2009China standard time (CST), the study analyzes the relationships between dTsa and brightness temperature in the infrared atmospheric window band (Bt31 and Bt32), the water vapor band (Bt28), the atmospheric temperature band (Bt25), and the CO2 band (Bt34). A model estimating dTsa is built. The model coefficients are estimated for 96 stations representing 96 sets of surface and atmospheric conditions, and 71 sets of coefficients among them passing 90% confidence levels of estimating dTsa are selected as references. Combined with the probabilistic neural network (PNN) method and nine parameters reflecting surface characteristics in one season and month, the Tibetan Plateau surface is classified as 71 types with 71 sets of coefficients. PNN is certified an efficient classification method for multiple parameters and mass data. Based on PNN and estimated model, estimated dTsa shows 1.36\u00b0C root-mean-square error and a standard deviation of 0.74\u00b0C, and dTsa distribution exhibits all centers with peak value and valley value of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, MYD07, and simple regression model results, showing its superiority. The model is worthy of further exploration and application in an effort to advance the retrieval of surface energy fluxes from remote sensing.\n",

The models simulate periods with in-phase seasonal precipitation anomalies, but the strength of this relationship is variable on multidecadal time scales, behavior that is also exhibited by the reconstructions. The models, however, are unable to simulate periods with consistently out-of-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies as observed in the latter part of the instrumental interval. The periods with predominantly in-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies in the models are significant against randomness, and while this result is suggestive of a potential for dual-season drought on interannual and longer time scales, models do not consistently exhibit the persistent dual-season drought seen in the dendroclimatic reconstructions. These collective findings indicate that model-derived drought risk assessments may underestimate the potential for dual-season drought in 21st century projections of hydroclimate in the American Southwest and parts of Mexico.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Weather Research Forecast (WRF) mesoscale model coupled with a detailed bin microphysics scheme is used to investigate the impact of aerosol particles serving as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei on orographic clouds and precipitation. A mixed-phase orographic cloud developed under two scenarios of aerosol (a typical continental background and a relatively polluted urban condition) and ice nuclei over an idealized mountain is simulated. The results show that, when the initial aerosol condition is changed from the relatively clean case to the polluted scenario, more droplets are activated, leading to a delay in precipitation, but the precipitation amount over the terrain is increased by about 10%. A detailed analysis of the microphysical processes indicates that ice-phase particles play an important role in cloud development, and their contribution to precipitation becomes more important with increasing aerosol particle concentrations. The growth of ice-phase particles through riming and Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen regime is more effective under more polluted conditions, mainly due to the increased number of droplets with a diameter of 10\u201330\u2009\u00b5m. Sensitivity tests also show that a tenfold increase in the concentration of ice crystals formed from ice nucleation leads to about 7% increase in precipitation, and the sensitivity of the precipitation to changes in the concentration and size distribution of aerosol particles is becoming less pronounced when the concentration of ice crystals is also increased.\n",

This is the first systematic full-wave study of LEMP propagation effects based on a realistic return-stroke model and including the complete return-stroke frequency range. Influences of the return-stroke wavefront speed (ranging from c/2 to c, where c is the speed of light), current risetime (ranging from 0.5 to 5\u2009\u00b5s), and ground conductivity (ranging from 0.1\u2009mS/m to \u221e) on H\u03c6, Ez, and Eh have been investigated. Also, the FDTD-computed waveforms of Eh have been compared with the corresponding ones computed using the Cooray-Rubinstein formula. Peaks of H\u03c6, Ez, and Eh are nearly proportional to the return-stroke wavefront speed. The peak of Eh decreases with increasing current risetime, while those of H\u03c6 and Ez are only slightly influenced by it. The peaks of H\u03c6 and Ez are essentially independent of the ground conductivity at a distance of 5\u2009km. Beyond this distance, they appreciably decrease relative to the perfectly conducting ground case, and the decrease is stronger for lower ground conductivity values. The peak of Eh increases with decreasing ground conductivity. The computed Eh/Ez is consistent with measurements of Thomson et al. (1988). The observed decrease of Ez peak and increase of Ez risetime due to propagation over 200\u2009km of Florida soil are reasonably well reproduced by the FDTD simulation with ground conductivity of 1\u2009mS/m.\n",

        "description": "\n\nVarious hydrological models have been developed for estimating root zone soil moisture dynamics. These models, however, incorporated their own parameterization approaches indicating that the output from the different model inherent structures might include uncertainties because we do not know which model structure is correct for describing the real system. More recently, multimodel approaches using a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) scheme can improve the overall predictive skill while individual models retain their own uncertainties for simulated soil moisture based on a single set of weights in modeling under different land surface wetness conditions (e.g., wet, moderately wet, and dry conditions). In order to overcome their limitations, we developed a BMA-based multimodel simulation approach based on various soil wetness conditions for estimating effective surface soil moisture dynamics (0\u20135\u2009cm) and quantifying uncertainties efficiently based on the land surface wetness conditions. The newly developed approach adapts three different hydrological models (i.e., Noah Land Surface Model, Noah LSM; Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant, SWAP; and Community Land Model, CLM) for simulating soil moisture. These models were integrated with a modified-microGA (advanced version of original Genetic Algorithm (GA)) to search for optimized soil parameters for each model. Soil moisture was simulated from the estimated soil parameters using the hydrological models in a forward mode. It was found that SWAP performed better than others during wet condition, while Noah LSM and CLM showed a good agreement with measurements during dry condition. Thus, we inferred that performance of individual models with different model structures can be different with land surface wetness. Taking into account the effects of soil wetness on different model performances, we categorized soil moisture measurements and estimated different weights for each category using the BMA scheme. Effective surface soil moisture dynamics were obtained by aggregating multiple weighted soil moisture. Our findings demonstrated that the effective soil moisture estimates derived by this approach showed a better match with the measurements compared to the original models and single-weighted outputs. Multimodel simulation approach based on land surface wetness enhances the ability to predict reliable soil moisture dynamics and reflects the strengths of different hydrological models under various soil wetness conditions.\n",

In situ COT, LWP, and re were calculated using 5\u2009m vertically averaged droplet probe measurements of complete vertical cloud penetrations. MODIS COT, LWP, and re 1\u2009km\u2009pixels were averaged along these penetrations. COT comparisons in POST showed strong correlations and a near 1:1 relationship. In MASE, comparisons showed strong correlations; however, MODIS COT exceeded in situ COT, likely due to larger temporal differences between MODIS and in situ measurements. LWP comparisons between two cloud probes show good agreement for POST but not MASE, giving confidence to POST data. Both projects provided strong LWP correlations but MODIS exceeded in situ by 14\u201336%. MODIS in situ re correlations were strong, but MODIS 2.1\u2009\u00b5m re exceeded in situ re, which contributed to LWP bias; in POST, MODIS re was 20\u201330% greater than in situ re. Maximum in situ re near cloud top showed comparisons nearer 1:1. Other MODIS re bands (3.7\u2009\u00b5m and 1.6\u2009\u00b5m) showed similar comparisons. Temporal differences between MODIS and in situ measurements, airplane speed differences, and cloud probe artifacts were likely causes of weaker MASE correlations. POST COT comparison was best for temporal differences under 20\u2009min. POST data validate MODIS COT but it also implies a positive MODIS re bias that propagates to LWP while still capturing variability.\n",

The work is the first application of dual polarization data to a jet-producing storm and is the fifth case related to a tropical disturbance. The storm environment is consistent with the moist tropical paradigm that characterizes about three quarters of the surface and aircraft observed jet and GJ events. The most unstable (MU) convective available potential energy is not unusual for Florida summer convection and is below the climatological mean for these events. An unusual speed shear layer is located near the storm equilibrium level (EL) and the storm exhibits a tilted structure with CGs displaced upshear. The turbulence, as measured by the eddy dissipation rate, is extreme near the storm top during the event window, consistent with the GJ mixing hypothesis. The individual events are collocated with, and track along, the center axis of the divergent outflow at the EL and occur within the region of the coldest GOES IR temperatures\u2014placing the events within the overshoot.

However, they cannot be directly measured from field measurements or easily calculated with great accuracy. In the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM), a constrained variational algorithm (1-D constrained variational analysis (1DCVA)) has been used to derive large-scale forcing data over a sounding network domain with the aid of flux measurements at the surface and top of the atmosphere (TOA). The 1DCVA algorithm is now extended into three dimensions (3DCVA) along with other improvements to calculate gridded large-scale forcing data, diabatic heating sources (Q1), and moisture sinks (Q2). Results are presented for a midlatitude cyclone case study on 3 March 2000 at the ARM Southern Great Plains site. These results are used to evaluate the diabatic heating fields in the available products such as Rapid Update Cycle, ERA-Interim, National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis, and North American Regional Reanalysis. We show that although the analysis/reanalysis generally captures the atmospheric state of the cyclone, their biases in the derivative terms (Q1 and Q2) at regional scale of a few hundred kilometers are large and all analyses/reanalyses tend to underestimate the subgrid-scale upward transport of moist static energy in the lower troposphere. The 3DCVA-gridded large-scale forcing data are physically consistent with the spatial distribution of surface and TOA measurements of radiation, precipitation, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and clouds that are better suited to force SCMs, CRMs, and LESs. Possible applications of the 3DCVA are discussed.",

It is important to understand how conduction electrons interact with air in order to accurately predict EMP evolution and propagation. An electron swarm model can be used to monitor the time evolution of conduction electrons in an environment characterized by electric field and pressure. Here a swarm model is developed that is based on the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) described by Higgins et al. (1973), hereinafter HLO. The ODEs characterize the swarm electric field, electron temperature, electron number density, and drift velocity. Important swarm parameters, the momentum transfer collision frequency, energy transfer collision frequency, and ionization rate, are calculated and compared to the previously reported fitted functions given in HLO. These swarm parameters are found using BOLSIG+, a two term Boltzmann solver developed by Hagelaar and Pitchford (2005), which utilizes updated cross sections from the LXcat website created by Pancheshnyi et al. (2012). We validate the swarm model by comparing to experimental effective ionization coefficient data in Dutton (1975) and drift velocity data in Ruiz-Vargas et al. (2010). In addition, we report on electron equilibrium temperatures and times for a uniform electric field of 1\u2009StatV/cm for atmospheric heights from 0 to 40\u2009km. It is shown that the equilibrium temperature and time are sensitive to the modifications in the collision frequencies and ionization rate based on the updated electron interaction cross sections.",

This study presents an assessment of the monthly precipitation forecast of the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) for three agroecological zones (Sudan-Sahel, Sudan, and Guinean zone) of the Volta Basin. The CFSv2 performance is evaluated for the Sahel drought 1983 and for all August months of the reforecast period (1982\u20132009) with lead times up to 8\u2009months using a quantile-quantile transformation for bias correction. In addition, an operational experiment is performed for the rainy season 2013 to analyze the performance of a dynamical downscaling approach for this region. Twenty-two CFSv2 ensemble members initialized in February 2013 are transferred to a resolution of 10\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009km using the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model. Since the uncorrected CFSv2 precipitation forecasts are characterized by a high uncertainty (up to 175% of the observed variability), the quantile-quantile transformation can clearly reduce this overestimation with the potential to provide skillful and valuable early warnings of precipitation deficits and excess up to 6\u2009months in ahead, particularly for the Sudan-Sahel zone. The operational experiment illustrates that CFSv2-WRF can reduce the CFSv2 uncertainty (up to 69%) for monthly precipitation and the onset of the rainy season but has still strong deficits regarding the northward progression of the rain belt. Further studies are necessary for a more robust assessment of the techniques applied in this study to confirm these promising outcomes.",

Our results show that the summer SAT variability in Patagonia is highly driven by the intraseasonal activity (~80%), especially by that associated with the MJO. The active MJO phases modulate the spatial mean intraseasonal temperature signal in Eastern Patagonia with ~1.5\u00b0C of amplitude. In most of the region, the warmest (coldest) conditions are found during active phase 8 (4). These opposite states of the temperature perturbations are related to almost inverse midlevel circulation anomalies over southern South America and the southwest Atlantic, which are part of a large-scale Rossby-like wave train of alternating circulation anomalies extended along the South Pacific. The corresponding outgoing longwave radiation anomalies suggest that these structures may be triggered by anomalous convection in the tropics. Furthermore, we show that intraseasonal heat waves in southeastern Patagonia tend to occur during active MJO phase 8. These events are also induced by a wave train pattern over the South Pacific, associated with other intraseasonal variability sources. Hence, as shown in a case study, circulation anomalies over the South Pacific triggered, in general, by tropical convection variability and, in particular, by the MJO activity may constructively interact with circulation patterns resulting from the extratropical dynamics, eventually leading to intraseasonal heat waves in southeastern Patagonia.",

We examine the climatological distribution of over-ocean, near-surface wind speeds within a Pan-Arctic domain for 18\u2009years (1990\u20132007) in four gridded data sets: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-I), the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, version 2 of the Common Ocean-Ice Reference Experiment data set, and a regional climate simulation generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model run at 50\u2009km (WRF50) horizontal resolution with ERA Interim as lateral boundary conditions. We estimate probability density functions, the annual cycle, and map the 50th and 99th percentile winds. We then perform the same statistical analysis of winds for 2\u2009years when 10\u2009km WRF data are available (June 2005 to May 2007); despite the much shorter time period, the Pan-Arctic statistics are very similar to those from the 18\u2009year analysis. We repeat the wind speed statistical analysis within a subdomain surrounding Greenland and find that WRF10 has consistently larger maximum wind speeds, but this difference only appears at wind speed percentiles higher than 99%. Differences in the 99th percentile wind speeds are spatially heterogeneous. An investigation of surface fluxes within WRF50 and WRF10 reveals unrealistically large sensible heat fluxes along the sea ice edge, and the geographic distribution and magnitude of these fluxes is shown to be sensitive to sea ice representation in WRF.",

Here we use a high-resolution spatial and temporal seamless gridded land surface forcing data set to provide an assessment of recent spatiotemporal patterns in temperature extremes over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We asked the following: (1) How are temperature extremes changing across the different regions of CONUS? (2) How do changes in extremes vary on seasonal, annual, and decadal scales? (3) How do changes in extremes relate to changes in mean conditions? And (4) do extremes relate to major modes of ocean-atmosphere variability? We derive a subset of the CLIMDEX extreme indices from the North American Land Data Assimilation phase 2 forcing data set. While there were warming trends in all indices, daytime temperature extremes warmed more than nighttime. Spring warming was the strongest and most extensive across CONUS, and summer experienced the strongest and most extensive decrease in cold extremes. Increase in winter warm extremes appeared weakening relative to the rapid 1950\u20131990 increase found in previous studies. The Northeast and Midwest experienced the most warming, while the Northwest and North Great Plains saw the least. We found changes in average temperatures were more associated with changes in cold extremes than warm extremes. Since 2006 there have been 5\u2009years when more than 5% of the U.S. experienced at least 90 warm days, something not observed in the previous 25\u2009years. The unusually warm first decade of 21st century could have been associated with the warm conditions of near El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation-neutral phase of the decade, and possibly amplified by anthropogenic forcing. The widespread, lengthy, and severe extreme hot events documented here during the past three decades underscore the need to implement thoughtful adaptation plans in the very near future, to the growing evidence of increasing warm extremes across United States.",

The results suggest that the boreal summer SAH is more significantly influenced by preceding ENSO events in the easterly phase of the QBO than in the westerly phase. The change in the ENSO-SAH relationship in the different QBO phases may be attributable to the change in the ENSO-induced sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Specifically, ENSO's influence on the following summer's TIO SST is more significant when the QBO is in its easterly phase than westerly phase. Further analysis showed that the change in the connection between ENSO and the TIO SST in the different QBO phases may be attributable to change in the anomalous tropical Indian Ocean cell (IOC) associated with ENSO. In particular, the anomalous IOC induced by anomalous Walker circulation over the tropical Pacific is stronger and located further west in QBO easterly than westerly phase. This leads to stronger descending motion and larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase. These larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase could exert a more significant influence on the tropospheric temperature through moist adjustment, which subsequently results in stronger SAH variability.",

        "description": "\nRecent progress of including lake subroutines in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models has led to more accurate forecasts. In lake models, one essential parameter is water clarity, parameterized via the light extinction coefficient, Kd, for which a global constant value is usually used. We used direct eddy covariance fluxes and basic meteorological measurements coupled with lake water temperature and clarity measurements from a boreal lake to estimate the performance of two lake models, LAKE and FLake. These models represent two 1-D modeling frameworks broadly used in NWP. The results show that the lake models are very sensitive to changes in Kd when it is lower than 0.5\u2009m\u22121. The progress of thermal stratification depended strongly on Kd. In dark-water simulations the mixed layer was shallower, longwave and turbulent heat losses higher, and therefore the average water column temperatures lower than in clear-water simulations. Thus, changes in water clarity can also affect the onset of ice cover. The more complex LAKE modeled the seasonal thermocline deepening, whereas it remained virtually constant during summer in the FLake model. Both models overestimated the surface water temperatures by about 1\u00b0C and latent heat flux by >30%, but the variations in heat storage and sensible heat flux were adequately simulated. Our results suggest that, at least for humic lakes, a lake-specific, but not time-depending, constant value for Kd can be used and that a global mapping of Kd would be most beneficial in regions with relatively clear lakes, e.g., in lakes at high altitudes.",

The Hexi Corridor, which is a typical arid and semiarid region in Northwest China, was selected as the study area. Streamflows were simulated by an integrated water system model in a historical period (1985\u20132005) and three future periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s). Twenty-nine global climate models were picked from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 based on projection performance, and the high (RCP85) and intermediate (RCP45) ranges of Representative Concentration Pathways were selected for future scenario analysis. All the streamflows were characterized in detail by flow regime metrics, including the magnitude, variability, and frequency of the overall flow events. The regional impacts of climate change were assessed and clustered into several similar spatial patterns. Results showed that the projected climate change would sensibly increase the magnitudes of average and low flows (75th percentile), as well as the frequencies of low and high flows (25th percentile), but decrease the flow variability. By contrast, it would not sensibly change the magnitude of high-flow events. The flow regime variations of all scenarios and periods were clustered into three robust classes (highly, moderately, and slightly impacted classes) in the entire region. The flow regimes would be highly and moderately impacted in the middle stream and downstream with large-sized and semidesert catchments but slightly impacted in the upper and middle streams with small-sized and montane vegetation catchments. The impacted classes will sensibly vary at most stations in different future periods because of the spatial differences of climate change. This study would provide scientific support to implement the integrated adaptive water resource management for climate change at regional scales in the arid Hexi Corridor.",

ISUAL has an imager and a spectrophotometer that observe TLEs all over the globe. Among these phenomena, elves are particularly difficult to detect. ISUAL often records events that correspond to significant far ultraviolet (FUV) emissions in the spectrophotometer but have no discernible TLEs in the imager. These FUV events are called \u201cdim\u201d elves. Therefore, it is important to develop mathematical tools to analyze the data to obtain a better evaluation of the number of elves and their occurrence. Multivariate approaches are applied to characterize the unlabeled events. The first approach is the principal component analysis which distinguishes two different groups, one including elves and dim elves. The second approach is the PARallel FACtor analysis which provides a waveform model for each group. These methodologies confirm that FUV signal is the evidence of TLE presence. A crude classification method was then suggested taking into account these results. The proportion of elves, relatively to the considered ISUAL data set, is found to be about 40%. It is similar to previous results and confirms that relatively weak lightning peak current is sufficient to produce elves. This new strategy demonstrates the potential for discriminating between lightning and TLEs without prior knowledge within the selectivity of the FUV spectral band.",

Here we make use of 10\u2009years of snow pit and short core \u03b418O data and hourly snow-height measurements obtained by an automated weather station deployed at the ice cap's summit to analyze linkages between snowfall, \u03b418O, and the South American summer monsoon (SASM). Snow accumulation peaks in December and is negative May\u2013September. Snow \u03b418O values decrease gradually through austral summer from about \u221217 to \u221224\u2030. Surface snow \u03b418O is altered after deposition during austral winter from about \u221224 to \u221215\u2030. More than 70% of the total snow accumulation is tied to convection along the leading edge of cold air incursions of midlatitude air advected equatorward from southern South America. Snowfall amplitude at Quelccaya Ice Cap varies systematically with regional precipitation, atmospheric dynamics, midtroposphere humidity, and water vapor \u03b4D. Strongest snowfall gains correspond with positive precipitation anomalies over the western Amazon Basin, increased humidity, and lowered water vapor \u03b4D values, consistent with the \u201camount effect.\u201d We discuss ventilation of the monsoon, modulated by midlatitude cold air advection, as potentially diagnostic of the relationship between SASM dynamics and Quelccaya snowfall. Results will serve as a basis for development of a comprehensive isotopic forward model to reconstruct past monsoon dynamics using the ice core \u03b418O record.",

The results show that the seasonal cycle of river discharge is generally modeled well in the low and middle latitudes but not in the high latitudes, where the peak discharge (due to snow and ice melting) is underestimated. For the annual mean discharge, the DGVMs chained with the routing model show an underestimation. Furthermore, the 30\u2009year trend of discharge is also underestimated. For the interannual variability of discharge, a skill score based on overlapping of probability density functions (PDFs) suggests that most models correctly reproduce the observed variability (correlation coefficient higher than 0.5; i.e., models account for 50% of observed interannual variability) except for the Lena, Yenisei, Yukon, and the Congo river basins. In addition, we compared the simulated runoff from different simulations where models were forced with either fixed or varying land use. This suggests that both seasonal and annual mean runoff has been little affected by land use change but that the trend itself of runoff is sensitive to land use change. None of the models when considered individually show significantly better performances than any other and in all basins. This suggests that based on current modeling capability, a regional-weighted average of multimodel ensemble projections might be appropriate to reduce the bias in future projection of global river discharge.",

The observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin is too short (A.D. 1851 to present) to allow for accurate assessment of low-frequency variability in storm activity. In order to overcome the limitations of the short observational record, we downscale four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic Basin that span the interval of A.D. 850\u20132005. Using these long-term synthetic tropical cyclone data sets, we investigate the relationship between power dissipation and ocean temperature metrics, as well as the relationship between basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone count statistics over the past millennium. Contrary to previous studies, we find only a very weak relationship between power dissipation and main development region sea surface temperature in the Atlantic Basin. Consistent with previous studies, we find that basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone counts are significantly correlated with one another, lending further support for the use of paleohurricane landfall records to infer long-term basin-wide tropical cyclone trends.",

        "description": "\n\nSocioeconomic drought broadly refers to conditions whereby the water supply cannot satisfy the demand. Most previous studies describe droughts based on large-scale meteorological/hydrologic conditions, ignoring the demand and local resilience to cope with climate variability. Reservoirs provide resilience against climatic extremes and play a key role in water supply and demand management. Here we outline a unique multivariate approach as a measure of socioeconomic drought, termed Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI). The model combines information on the inflow and reservoir storage relative to the demand. MSRRI combines (I) a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach that focuses on processes/phenomena that cannot be simply controlled or altered by decision makers, such as climate change and variability, and (II) a \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology that represents the local resilience and societal capacity to respond or adapt to droughts. MSRRI is based on a nonparametric multivariate distribution function that links inflow-demand reliability indicator to water storage resilience indicator. These indicators are used to assess socioeconomic drought during the Australian Millennium drought (1998\u20132010) and the 2011\u20132014 California drought. The results show that MSRRI is superior to univariate indices because it captures both early onset and persistence of water stress over time. The suggested framework can be applied to both individual reservoirs and a group of reservoirs in a region, and it is consistent with the currently available standardized drought indicators. MSRRI provides complementary information on socioeconomic drought development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand that cannot be achieved from the commonly used drought indicators.",

In this work the evolution of the advective BDC for the period 1979\u20132012 is evaluated and compared in three modern reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA, and JRA-55). Three different estimates of the BDC are computed for each reanalysis, one based on the definition of the residual circulation and two indirect estimates derived from momentum and thermodynamic balances. The comparison among the nine estimates shows substantial uncertainty in the mean magnitude (\u223c40%) but significant common variability. The tropical upwelling series show variability linked to the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation and to El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and also reflect extreme events such as major sudden stratospheric warmings and volcanic eruptions. The trend analysis suggests a strengthening of tropical upwelling of around 2\u20135%/decade throughout the layer 100\u201310\u2009hPa. The global spatial structure of the BDC trends provides evidence of an overall acceleration of the circulation in both hemispheres, with qualitative agreement among the estimates. The global BDC trends are mainly linked to changes in the boreal winter season and can be tracked to long-term increases in the resolved wave drag in both hemispheres.",

Due to this complexity, process-based models are often preferred to estimate the net magnitude and directionality of interactions in the Earth system. However, these models are based on simplifications of our understanding of nature and thus are unavoidably imperfect. Conversely, observation-based data of climatic and environmental variables are becoming increasingly accessible over global scales due to the progress of spaceborne sensing technologies and data-assimilation techniques. Albeit uncertain, these data enable the possibility to start unraveling complex multivariable, multiscale relationships if the appropriate statistical methods are applied. Here we investigate the potential of the wavelet cross-correlation method as a tool for identifying time/frequency-dependent interactions, feedback, and regime shifts in geophysical systems. The ability of wavelet cross-correlation to resolve the fast and slow components of coupled systems is tested on synthetic data of known directionality and then applied to observations to study one of the most critical interactions between land and atmosphere: the coupling between soil moisture and near-ground air temperature. Results show that our method is able to capture the dynamics of the soil moisture-temperature coupling over a wide range of temporal scales (from days to several months) and climatic regimes (from wet to dry) and consistently identify the magnitude and directionality of the coupling. Consequently, wavelet cross-correlations are presented as a promising tool for the study of multiscale interactions, with the potential of being extended to the analysis of causal relationships in the Earth system.",

Results show that the model does not simulate a prolonged period of negative IPO before A.D. 1300 suggested by the proxy reconstruction, although it does simulate centennial periods of negative and positive IPO. The simulated IPO exhibits several low-frequency oscillations, including 10\u201323, 30\u201333, 35\u201370, and 85\u2013110\u2009years. However, it remains an open question whether simulated IPO oscillations longer than bidecadal mode can be or not be considered as essentially internal modes of variability. The simulations indicate that precipitation over eastern China is associated with the IPO. When the strongest IPO signal of 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation occurs, the summer precipitation goes of opposite sign over North China (NC) and the middle and lower Yangtze River Vally (MLYRV), i.e., dipole mode such as the \u201cflood-in-south and drought-in-north\u201d pattern that occurs during the positive IPO episodes and vice versa. While coherent mode is dominant when the relatively weak IPO signal occurs, and warm phases of the IPO coincide with coherent drought and vice versa. The association between 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation of the IPO and precipitation in NC is more marked than that in the MLYRV. Our results suggest that the internal variability of climate system like the IPO may play an important role in precipitation over eastern China, at least on the 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation.",

In this paper, we focus on lightning flashes which did not induce TLEs.

We demonstrate that the lightning/satellite distance and the altitude of the lightning need to be taken into account.

USLM disturbances have been shown to precede the development of every major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), thus potentially increasing the predictability of SSWs. WACCM4 is shown to internally and spontaneously generate polar USLM disturbances that are consistent with an established USLM climatology based on the UK Meteorological Office stratospheric assimilation. Arctic USLM disturbances in WACCM4 occur on average 2.65 times per winter season; are most frequently generated in the months of December, January, and February; and are preferentially located in the longitude band between 30\u00b0E and 120\u00b0E, poleward of 40\u00b0 latitude, all in good agreement with observations. Analysis of composite USLM events corroborates the underlying mechanism responsible for their formation as planetary wave breaking between ~45\u2009km and 65\u2009km that decelerates the mean flow, induces vertical air motion, and causes regions of adiabatic heating in a limited longitude band. These conditions are suitable for the growth of a baroclinic instability at the stratopause level. Using the Trenberth localized three-dimensional Eliassen-Palm flux along with the Charney-Stern criteria, a WACCM4 case study of an independent USLM event implicates baroclinic instability as a critical process in the development of the USLM thermal structure.",

Decreasing solar flux leads to a cooling of the tropical upper stratosphere above 7\u2009hPa, while increasing solar flux leads to a warming of the tropical upper stratosphere above 7\u2009hPa, after a lag of approximately 6\u201310\u2009days. Late winter (February\u2013March) Arctic stratospheric temperatures also change in response to changing incoming solar flux in a manner consistent with that seen on the 11\u2009year timescale: 10\u201330\u2009days after the start of decreasing solar flux, the polar cap warms during the easterly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation. In contrast, cooling is present after decreasing solar flux during the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (though it is less robust than the warming during the easterly phase). The estimated composite mean changes in Northern Hemisphere upper stratospheric (\u223c 5\u2009hPa) polar temperatures exceed 8\u2009K and are potentially a source of intraseasonal predictability for the surface. These changes in polar temperature are consistent with the changes in wave driving entering the stratosphere.",

Here we show that the both zonal means of (1) MODIS-retrieved \u03c4 and Re and (2) \u03c4 retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) using MODIS-retrieved Re as input exhibit a large, local negative bias in the rainbow scattering direction relative to adjacent scattering angles for oceanic water clouds. Using radiative transfer simulations, we demonstrate that these local biases are explained by overestimates in MODIS-retrieved Re. While 3-D factors on the angular variability of \u03c4 are evident, we conclude that a Re bias is itself an important contributor to this variability. With 3-D factors present, we show that upper and lower bound estimates on the biases in the three MODIS Re products, namely Re1.6, Re2.1, and Re3.7 retrieved from 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7\u2009\u00b5m channels, respectively, are possible from a combination of MISR and MODIS data. The midpoints of the upper and lower bounds in zonal mean biases are estimated to be 3\u201311\u2009\u00b5m for Re2.1 and Re1.6 and 2\u20137\u2009\u00b5m for Re3.7, depending on latitude, with smaller biases at latitudes where more stratiform clouds contribute to the total low cloud cover. Removing the bias from the zonal means reveals that Re1.6, Re2.1, and Re3.7 are more similar with each other compared to their original values. The change in zonal mean of Re as a function of latitude is also very different between original and bias-corrected products. These differences change the interpretation of the vertical and horizontal distribution of Re from the original MODIS product.",

Further, the atmospheric implications of dust coatings on ice-cloud properties under different assumptions of primary ice nucleation mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the ice nucleation ability of Arizona Test Dust, illite, K-feldspar, and quartz as a function of temperature (\u221225\u00b0C to \u221230\u00b0C) and relative humidity with respect to water (75% to 110%). The particles (bare or nitric acid coated) were size selected at 250 nm, and the fraction of particles nucleating ice at various temperature and saturation conditions was determined. All of the dust species nucleated ice at subsaturated conditions, although the coated particles (except quartz) showed a reduction in their ice nucleation ability relative to bare particles. However, at supersaturated conditions, bare and coated particles had nearly equivalent ice nucleation characteristics. The results of a single-column model showed that simulated ice crystal number concentrations are mostly dependent upon the coated particle fraction, primary ice nucleation mechanisms, and competition among ice nucleation mechanisms to nucleate ice. In general, coatings were observed to modify ice-cloud properties, and the complexity of ice-cloud and mixed-phase-cloud evolution when different primary ice nucleation mechanisms compete for fixed water vapor budgets was supported.",

        "description": "\nA Classical-Nucleation-Theory-based parameterization for heterogenous ice nucleation, including explicit dependencies of the nucleation rates on the number concentration, size, and composition of the ambient aerosol population, is implemented in a cloud-scale, large-eddy simulation model and evaluated against Arctic mixed-phase cloud events observed during Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC). An important feature of the parameterization is that the ice nucleation efficiency of each considered aerosol type is described using a contact angle distribution which evolves with time so that the model accounts for the inhibition of ice nucleation as the most efficient ice-forming particles are nucleated and scavenged. The model gives a reasonable representation of first-order (ice water paths) and second-order (ice crystal size distributions) ice microphysical properties. The production of new ice crystals in the upper part of the cloud, essential to guarantee sustained mixed-phase conditions, is found to be controlled mostly by the competition between radiative cooling (resulting in more aerosol particles becoming efficient ice nuclei as the temperature decreases), cloud-top entrainment (entraining fresh particles into the cloud), and nucleation scavenging of the ice+forming aerosol particles. The relative contribution of each process is mostly determined by the cloud-top temperature and the entrainment rates. Accounting for the evolution of the contact angle probability density function with time seems to be essential to capture the persistence of in-cloud ice production without having to, for example, increase the free tropospheric aerosol concentration. Although limited to only three cases and despite important limitations of the parameterization (e.g., the present version only considers dust and black carbon as potential ice nuclei), the results suggest that modeling the time evolution of the ice nuclei population ability to form ice is required to accurately model Arctic mixed-phase cloud processes.",

A tight relationship is found over SE Asia and the adjacent seas during summer between the cloud-free aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the cloud thickness required for the initiation of warm rain, as represented by the satellite-retrieved cloud droplet re of 14\u2009\u00b5m, for a subset of conditions that minimize measurement artifacts. This cloud depth (\u0394T14) is parameterized as the difference between the cloud base temperature and the temperature at the height where re exceeds 14\u2009\u00b5m (T14). For a unit increase of AOD, the height of rain initiation is increased by about 5.5\u2009km. The concern of data artifacts due to the increase in AOD near clouds was mitigated by selecting only scenes with cloud fraction (CF)\u2009<\u20090.1. For CF\u2009>\u20090.1 and \u0394T14\u2009>\u2009~20\u00b0C, the increase of \u0394T14 gradually levels off with further increase of AOD, possibly because the AOD is enhanced by aerosol upward transport and detrainment through the clouds below the T14 isotherm. The bias in the retrieved re due to the different geometries of solar illumination was also quantified. It was shown that the retrievals are valid only for backscatter views or when avoiding scenes with significant amount of cloud self-shadowing. These artifacts might have contributed to past reported relationships between cloud properties and AOD.",

AMC has an annual occurrence frequency of 42.3%, which includes 18.7% of single-layered AMCs and 23.6% for multiple layers. Two cloud base heights (CBHs) are defined from ceilometer and micropulse lidar (MPL) measurements. For single-layered AMC, the ceilometer-derived CBH represents the base of the liquid-dominant layer near the cloud top, while MPL-derived CBH represents base of the lower ice-dominant layer. The annual mean CBHs from ceilometer and MPL measurements are 1.0\u2009km and 0.6\u2009km, respectively, with the largest difference (~1.0\u2009km) occurring from December to March and the smallest difference in September. The humidity inversion occurrence decreases with increasing humidity inversion intensity (stronger in summer than in winter). During the winter months, AMC occurrences increase from 15% to 35% when the inversion intensity increases from 0.1 to 0.9\u2009g/kg. On the contrary, despite a higher frequency of strong humidity inversion in summer, AMC occurrences are nearly invariant for different inversion intensities. On average, humidity and temperature inversion frequencies of occurrence above an AMC are 5 and 8 times, respectively, as high as those below an AMC. The strong inversion occurrences for both humidity and temperature above an AMC provide the moisture sources from above for the formation and maintenance of AMCs. This result helps to reconcile the persistency of AMCs even when the Arctic surface is covered by snow and ice.",

To exploit the remote sensing techniques that are used to monitor a volcanic cloud and return information on its properties, the effective complex refractive index of the volcanic ash is required. This paper presents the complex refractive index determined in the laboratory at 450.0\u2009nm, 546.7\u2009nm, and 650.0\u2009nm for volcanic ash samples from eruptions of Aso (Japan), Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn (Iceland), Chait\u00e9n (Chile), Etna (Italy), Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland), Tongariro (New Zealand), Askja (Iceland), Nisyros (Greece), Okmok (Alaska), Augustine (Alaska), and Spurr (Alaska). The Becke line method was used to measure the real part of the refractive index with an accuracy of 0.01. The values measured differed between eruptions and were in the range 1.51\u20131.63 at 450.0\u2009nm, 1.50\u20131.61 at 546.7\u2009nm, and 1.50\u20131.59 at 650.0\u2009nm. A novel method is introduced to derive the imaginary part of the refractive index from the attenuation of light by ash. The method has a precision in the range 10\u22123\u201310\u22124. The values for the ash imaginary refractive index ranged 0.22\u20131.70 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 450.0\u2009nm, 0.16\u20131.93 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 546.7\u2009nm, and 0.15\u20132.08 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 650.0\u2009nm. The accuracy of Becke and attenuation methods was assessed by measuring the complex refractive index of Hoya neutral density glass and found to have an accuracy of <0.01 and <2 \u00d7 10\u22125 for the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, respectively.",

At all wavelengths studied, slightly greater real components of the RI were observed for the SOA generated in the absence of SO2 compared with those generated in its presence. Considering the chemical properties, the differences in the oxidation state and/or ratio of particle density to molecular weight of compounds in the SOA are considered to be the main factors determining the real components. The imaginary components at \u2264532\u2009nm were found to increase with increasing initial SO2 concentration. The highly conjugated oligomers are suggested to be plausible chromophore candidates.

The model reproduces the observed seasonality of surface BC fairly well over most parts of India but fails to capture the seasonality in the Himalayas and deviates from the observed BC magnitude at several sites. The errors in modeled BC are attributed to uncertainties in BC emissions and their diurnal cycle, planetary boundary layer height underestimation, and aerosol processes. Model results show distinct but opposite seasonality of BC in the lower (LT) and free troposphere (FT) with BC showing winter maximum and summer minimum in the LT and vice versa in the FT. Our analysis shows that BC seasonality is not driven by seasonality of the anthropogenic emissions but by changes in the regional meteorology through weakening of the horizontal transport and strengthening of the vertical transport of BC during summertime compared to winter. BC in both the LT and FT comes mostly from anthropogenic emissions followed by biomass burning emissions except during winter when long-distant sources become more important in the FT. BC in the FT is significantly affected by anthropogenic emissions from all parts of India. The source-receptor relationship changes seasonally, but the regional transport remains a significant contributor to BC loadings in the LT of India, highlighting the necessity of considering nonlocal sources along with local emissions when designing strategies for mitigating BC impacts on air quality.",

Its transition at 90% (PR90) and its links with other relevant variables are evaluated using the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation Cloud Product climatology, reanalysis data, and other satellite observations. In 13 of 16 models, the PR90 transition height occurs too low (6\u2009km to 8.4\u2009km) and at temperatures too warm (\u221213.9\u00b0C to \u221232.5\u00b0C) compared to observations (8.6\u2009km, \u221233.7\u00b0C); features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with respect to ice above 6.5\u2009km. However, this bias would be slightly reduced by using the lidar simulator. In convective regimes (more humid air and precipitation), the observed cloud phase transition occurs at a warmer temperature than for subsidence regimes (less humid air and precipitation). Only few models manage to roughly replicate the observed correlations with humidity (5/16), vertical velocity (5/16), and precipitation (4/16); 3/16 perform well for all these parameters (MPI-ESM, NCAR-CAM5, and NCHU). Using an observation-based Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram, we illustrate that the Bergeron-Findeisen process is a necessary condition for models to represent the observed features.

Droplet nuclei include soot particles emitted from aircraft engines and atmospheric particles entrained into the plume. These precursor particles activate into copious homogeneously freezing water droplets as the plume relative humidity rises beyond liquid water saturation. A unimodal size spectrum of ice particles develops wherein ice particles grow to micrometer mean sizes. Contrail particle formation is analyzed over a wide range of soot emissions relating to conventional jet fuels as well as to alternative aviation fuels producing much less soot and volatile particle emissions. For current aviation fuels and propulsion technology, the number of contrail ice particles scales roughly in proportion to the number of emitted soot particles that act as water condensation nuclei despite their poor hygroscopicity. Close to the contrail formation threshold, only few plume particles can be water activated and freeze.

The calculated CBL height sequence displays the regular diurnal cycle of the CBL top. The prevalent mixing process within the CBL is also revealed. During the CBL growth period, the backscatter ratio R falls visibly with increasing altitude and has large variance within the CBL, suggesting that more abundant aerosol particles from lower altitudes are being transported upward and being mixed with the local background or advected aerosol layers. During the CBL quasistationary period, R tends to be vertically uniform, and its variance reaches a daytime minimum within the CBL, indicating that the vertical homogenization of aerosol particles produced by the convectively driven mixing reaches its maximum. During the afternoon and early evening transition period, the vertical uniformity of R weakens and the variance enlarges again, implying that the reduced convectively driven mixing fails to maintain a high vertical homogeneity. When the 1\u2009min R profiles were plotted together in terms of each 1\u2009h interval, the fluctuating R curves at heights around the CBL top looked like a \u201cnode\u201d, representing the structure of the entrainment zone between the CBL and the free troposphere. The moving node depicts the evolution of the entrainment zone. The diurnal variation of the CBL height shows an obvious seasonal dependence which coincides with the annual variation of the local surface temperature. The surface fine particle concentration generally has a more complex diurnal cycle than that expected from the CBL-dilution/CBL-accumulation effect. But, it shows a strong annual variation which is out of phase with respect to that of the monthly mean maximum CBL height. This tends to suggest that the seasonal behavior of the surface fine particle concentration mainly depends on the seasonal variation in available volume (determined by the CBL height) for aerosol dispersion.",

        "description": "\n\nThis study evaluates the performance of different MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol algorithms during fine particle pollution events over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region using Aerosol Robotic Network aerosol optical depth (AOD). These algorithms include the Deep Blue (DB) Collection 5.1 (C5) and Collection 6 (C6) algorithms at 10\u2009km resolution, the Dark Target (DT) C5 and C6 algorithms at 10\u2009km, the DT C6 algorithm at 3\u2009km, and the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) at 500\u2009m, 3\u2009km, and 10\u2009km resolutions. The DB C6 retrievals have 34\u201339% less uncertainties, 2\u20133 times smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE), and 3\u20134 times smaller mean absolute error (MAE) than DB C5 retrievals. The DT C6 has 4\u20138% lower bias, 4\u201312% less overestimation, and smaller RMSE and MAE errors than DT C5. Due to underestimation of surface reflectance and the use of inappropriate aerosol schemes, 87\u201389% of the collocations of the DT C6 at 3\u2009km fall above the expected error (EE), with overestimation of 64\u201379% which is 15\u201327% higher than that for the DT C6 at 10\u2009km. The results suggest that the DT C6 at 3\u2009km resolution is less reliable than that at 10\u2009km. The SARA AOD has small RMSE and MAE errors with 90\u201396% of the collocations falling within the EE. Overall, the SARA showed 15\u201316% less uncertainty than the DB C6 (10\u2009km), 69\u201372% less than the DT C6 (10\u2009km), and 79\u201383% less than the DT C6 (3\u2009km) retrievals.",

        "description": "\n\nWe evaluate polar ozone depletion chemistry using the specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model for the year 2011. We find that total ozone depletion in both hemispheres is dependent on cold temperatures (below 192 K) and associated heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric cloud particles. Reactions limited to warmer temperatures above 192 K, or on binary liquid aerosols, yield little modeled polar ozone depletion in either hemisphere. An imposed factor of three enhancement in stratospheric sulfate increases ozone loss by up to 20 Dobson unit (DU) in the Antarctic and 15 DU in the Arctic in this model. Such enhanced sulfate loads are similar to those observed following recent relatively small volcanic eruptions since 2005 and imply impacts on the search for polar ozone recovery. Ozone losses are strongly sensitive to temperature, with a test case cooler by 2 K producing as much as 30 DU additional ozone loss in the Antarctic and 40 DU in the Arctic. A new finding of this paper is the use of the temporal behavior and variability of ClONO2 and HCl as indicators of the efficacy of heterogeneous chemistry. Transport of ClONO2 from the southern subpolar regions near 55\u201365\u00b0S to higher latitudes near 65\u201375\u00b0S provides a flux of NOx from more sunlit latitudes to the edge of the vortex and is important for ozone loss in this model. Comparisons between modeled and observed total column and profile ozone perturbations, ClONO2 abundances, and the rate of change of HCl bolster confidence in these conclusions.",

        "description": "\n\nThe meteoric metal layers act as unique tracers of chemistry and dynamics in the upper atmosphere. Existing lidar studies from a few locations show that K exhibits a semiannual seasonality (winter and summer maxima), quite unlike the annual seasonality (winter maximum and summer minimum) seen with Na and Fe. This work uses spaceborne observations made with the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System instrument on the Odin satellite to retrieve the near-global K layer for the first time. The satellite data (2004 to mid-2013) are used to validate the implementation of a recently proposed potassium chemistry scheme in a whole atmosphere chemistry climate model, which provides a chemical basis for this semiannual seasonal behavior. The satellite and model data show that this semiannual seasonality is near global in extent, with the strongest variation at middle and high latitudes. The column abundance, centroid layer height, and root-mean-square width of the K layer are consistent with the limited available lidar record. The K data set is then used to investigate the impact of polar mesospheric clouds on the metal layers at high latitudes during summer. Finally, the occurrence frequency of sporadic K layers and their possible link to sporadic E layers are examined.",

        "description": "\nWater vapor in the lower stratosphere exhibits localized maximum values during Northern Hemisphere summer in the Asian and North American (NA) monsoon regions. The processes maintaining these maxima are not well understood. We analyze the variability of water vapor in the monsoon regions based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations during 2005\u20132013 and quantify links to deep convection, large-scale temperatures, and monsoonal circulations. Strong subseasonal variations in stratospheric water vapor are closely linked with deep convection in the monsoon regions, with the surprising result that stronger convection leads to a relatively dry stratosphere and weaker convection to a wetter stratosphere. This result is observed for both the Asian and NA monsoon regions. This behavior is explained by temperature changes in the stratosphere tied to deep convection: stronger convection leads to relatively cold temperatures in the subtropical lower stratosphere, which is the key region controlling large-scale dehydration within the anticyclonic monsoonal circulations. Likewise, weaker convection leads to warmer subtropical stratospheric temperatures, relatively less dehydration, and enhanced water vapor. The observed water vapor changes are in approximate agreement with those expected from the subtropical temperature variations, taking into account dilution of the dehydrated air into the larger monsoon region. These results demonstrate that stratospheric water vapor in the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation and temperatures, and overshooting deep convection plays a relatively minor role.",

        "description": "\nWe present a retrieval of several vibrational-vibrational (V\u2009V) and vibrational-thermal (V-T) collisional rate coefficients affecting the populations of the CO2 levels emitting at 10, 4.3 and 2.7\u2009\u03bcm from high-resolution limb atmospheric spectra taken by Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). This instrument has a high spectral resolution (0.0625\u2009cm\u22121) and a wide spectral coverage (from 685 to 2410\u2009cm\u22121) that allow measuring and discriminating among the many bands originating the atmospheric 4.3\u2009\u03bcm radiance. Also its high sensitivity allows measuring the atmospheric limb emission in a wide altitude range, from 20 to 170\u2009km in its middle and upper atmosphere modes, and hence obtain information on the temperature dependence of the collisional rates. In particular, we retrieve the rate coefficients and their temperature dependence in the 130\u2013250\u2009K range of the following processes: CO2(vd,v3)+N2\u21ccCO2(vd,v3\u22121)+N2(1) with vd=2v1+v2=2,3, and 4; CO2(v1,v2,l,1,r)+M\u21ccCO2(v1\u2032,v2\u2032,l\u2032,1,r\u2032)+M with \u0394vd=vd\u2032\u2212vd=0 and \u0394l = 0; and with \u0394vd=0 and \u0394l \u2260 0. In addition we have also retrieved the thermal relaxation of CO2(v3) into the v1 and v2 modes, e.g., CO2(vd,v3)+M\u21ccCO2(vd\u2032,v3\u22121)+M with \u0394vd=2\u20134 and \u0394v3=\u22121 and the efficiency of the excitation of N2(1) by O(1D). All of them were retrieved with a much better accuracy than were known before. The new rates have very important effects on the atmospheric limb radiance in the 10, 4.3 and 2.7\u2009\u03bcm spectral regions (5\u20138% at 4.3\u2009\u03bcm) and allow a more accurate inversion of the CO2 volume mixing ratio in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere from measurements taken in those spectral regions.",
