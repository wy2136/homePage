Dunker<br /><br />A new, path-integral method is presented for apportioning the concentrations\nof pollutants predicted by a photochemical model to emissions from different\nsources. A novel feature of the method is that it can apportion the\ndifference in a species concentration between two simulations. For example,\nthe anthropogenic ozone increment, which is the difference between a\nsimulation with all emissions present and another simulation with only the\nbackground (e.g., biogenic) emissions included, can be allocated to the\nanthropogenic emission sources. The method is based on an existing, exact\nmathematical equation. This equation is applied to relate the concentration\ndifference between simulations to line or path integrals of first-order\nsensitivity coefficients. The sensitivities describe the effects of changing\nthe emissions and are accurately calculated by the decoupled direct method.\nThe path represents a continuous variation of emissions between the two\nsimulations, and each path can be viewed as a separate emission-control\nstrategy. The method does not require auxiliary assumptions, e.g., whether\nozone formation is limited by the availability of volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs) or nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), and can be used for all the species\npredicted by the model. A simplified configuration of the Comprehensive Air\nQuality Model with Extensions (CAMx) is used to evaluate the accuracy of\ndifferent numerical integration procedures and the dependence of the source\ncontributions on the path. A Gauss\u2013Legendre formula using three or\nfour points along the path gives good accuracy for apportioning the\nanthropogenic increments of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and nitric\nacid. Source contributions to these increments were obtained for paths\nrepresenting proportional control of all anthropogenic emissions together,\ncontrol of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions before VOC emissions, and control of VOC\nemissions before NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. There are similarities in the source\ncontributions from the three paths but also differences due to the different\nchemical regimes resulting from the emission-control strategies.",

Hartmann, T. Gleeson, R. Rosolem, F. Pianosi, Y. Wada, and T. Wagener<br /><br />Karst develops through the dissolution of carbonate rock and is a major\nsource of groundwater contributing up to half of the total drinking water\nsupply in some European countries. Previous approaches to model future water\navailability in Europe are either too-small scale or do not incorporate\nkarst processes, i.e. preferential flow paths. This study presents the first\nsimulations of groundwater recharge in all karst regions in Europe with a\nparsimonious karst hydrology model. A novel parameter confinement strategy\ncombines a priori information with recharge-related observations (actual\nevapotranspiration and soil moisture) at locations across Europe while\nexplicitly identifying uncertainty in the model parameters. Europe's karst\nregions are divided into four typical karst landscapes (humid, mountain,\nMediterranean and desert) by cluster analysis and recharge is simulated from\n2002 to 2012 for each karst landscape. Mean annual recharge ranges from\nnegligible in deserts to > 1 m a<sup>\u22121</sup> in humid regions. The majority\nof recharge rates range  from 20 to 50% of precipitation and are\nsensitive to subannual climate variability. Simulation results are\nconsistent with independent observations of mean annual recharge and\nsignificantly better than other global hydrology models that do not consider\nkarst processes (PCR-GLOBWB, WaterGAP). Global hydrology models\nsystematically under-estimate karst recharge implying that they over-estimate\nactual evapotranspiration and surface runoff. Karst water budgets and thus\ninformation to support management decisions regarding drinking water supply\nand flood risk are significantly improved by our model.",

The performance of ISBA<sub>CC</sub> is\nslightly site dependent although similar to the widely evaluated LSM ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems \u2013 version 1187), which is based on different assumptions. Changes made to the\nautotrophic respiration functions, including a vertical profile of leaf\nrespiration, lead to yearly simulated carbon use efficiency (CUE) and carbon\nstocks which is consistent with an ecophysiological meta-analysis conducted on three\nAmazonian sites. Despite these major improvements, ISBA<sub>CC</sub> struggles to\ncapture the apparent seasonality of the carbon fluxes derived from the\nflux tower estimations.

The underlying meteorological\n      model is the new nonhydrostatic model system ICON (ICOsahedral\n      Nonhydrostatic) which allows a local grid refinement with two-way\n      interactions between the grids. We develop the extension ART (Aerosol\n      and Reactive Trace gases) with the goal of simulating interactions\n      between trace substances and the state of the atmosphere. Within this\n      paper, we present the basic equations and give an overview of the\n      physical parameterizations as well as numerical methods we use.\n<br><br>\n      First applications of the new model system for trace gases,\n      monodisperse particles and polydisperse particles are shown. The\n      simulated distribution of two very short-lived substances (VSLS), bromoform\n      (CHBr<sub>3</sub>) and dibromomethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>) reflecting the fast upward\n      transport shows a good agreement with observations and previous model\n      studies.

The use of\n            convolutions allow for flexibility in application to different atmospheric\n            grids. An approximation using one-dimensional convolutions is applied,\n            improving the time taken by the nudging scheme by 10\u201330 times\n            compared with a version using a two-dimensional convolution, without\n            measurably degrading its performance.

In contrast,\nmuch less attention has been given to the dependence of these gravity wave\nparameters on models' vertical resolutions. The present study demonstrates\nthe dependence of gravity wave momentum flux (GWMF) in the stratosphere and\nmesosphere on the model's vertical resolution, which is evaluated using an\nAGCM with a horizontal resolution of about 0.56\u00b0. We performed a\nseries of sensitivity test simulations changing only the model's vertical\nresolution above a height of 8 km, and found a global reduction of GWMF with\nincreasing vertical resolution. Inertial gravity waves with short vertical\nwavelengths simulated at higher vertical resolutions might play an important\nrole in determining GWMF in the summertime stratosphere.

Freshwater\nforcing due to iceberg melting is most pronounced very locally, in the\ncoastal zone around much of Antarctica, where it often exceeds in magnitude\nand opposes the negative freshwater fluxes associated with sea ice freezing.\nHowever, at most locations in the polar Southern Ocean, the annual-mean\nfreshwater flux due to icebergs, if present, is typically an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the contribution of sea ice melting and\nprecipitation. A notable exception is the southwest Atlantic sector of the\nSouthern Ocean, where iceberg melting reaches around 50% of net\nprecipitation over a large area. Including icebergs in place of coastal\nrunoff, sea ice concentration and thickness are notably decreased at most\nlocations around Antarctica, by up to ~ 20% in the eastern\nWeddell Sea, with more limited increases, of up to ~ 10% in\nthe Bellingshausen Sea. Antarctic sea ice mass decreases by 2.9%,\noverall. As a consequence of changes in net freshwater forcing and sea ice,\nsalinity and temperature distributions are also substantially altered.\nSurface salinity increases by ~ 0.1 psu around much of\nAntarctica, due to suppressed coastal runoff, with extensive freshening at\ndepth, extending to the greatest depths in the polar Southern Ocean where\ndiscernible effects on both salinity and temperature reach 2500 m in the\nWeddell Sea by the last pentad of the simulation. Substantial physical and\ndynamical responses to icebergs, throughout the global ocean, are explained\nby rapid propagation of density anomalies from high-to-low latitudes.\nComplementary to the baseline model used here, three prototype modifications\nto NEMO\u2013ICB are also introduced and discussed.",

Berchet, I. Pison, F. Chevallier, P. Bousquet, J.-L. Bonne, and J.-D. Paris<br /><br />Classical Bayesian atmospheric inversions  process atmospheric\nobservations and prior emissions, the two being connected by an\nobservation operator picturing mainly the atmospheric transport.\nThese inversions rely on prescribed errors in the observations, the\nprior emissions and the observation operator. When data pieces are\nsparse, inversion results are very sensitive to the prescribed error\ndistributions, which are not accurately known. The classical\nBayesian framework experiences difficulties in quantifying the\nimpact of mis-specified error distributions on the optimized fluxes.\nIn order to cope with this issue, we rely on recent research results\nto enhance the classical Bayesian inversion framework through a\nmarginalization on a large set of plausible errors that can be\nprescribed in the system. The marginalization consists in computing\ninversions for all possible error distributions weighted by the\nprobability of occurrence of the error distributions. The posterior\ndistribution of the fluxes calculated by the marginalization is not\nexplicitly describable. As a consequence, we carry out a Monte Carlo\nsampling based on an approximation of the probability of occurrence\nof the error distributions. This approximation is deduced from the\nwell-tested method of the maximum likelihood estimation. Thus, the\nmarginalized inversion relies on an automatic objectified diagnosis\nof the error statistics, without any prior knowledge about the\nmatrices. It robustly accounts for the uncertainties on the error\ndistributions, contrary to what is classically done with frozen\nexpert-knowledge error statistics. Some expert knowledge is still\nused in the method for the choice of an emission aggregation pattern\nand of a sampling protocol in order to reduce the computation cost.\nThe relevance and the robustness of the method is tested on a case\nstudy: the inversion of methane surface fluxes at the mesoscale\nwith virtual observations on a realistic network in Eurasia.\nObserving system simulation experiments are carried out with\ndifferent transport patterns, flux distributions and total prior\namounts of emitted methane. The method proves to consistently\nreproduce the known \"truth\" in most cases, with satisfactory\ntolerance intervals. Additionally, the method explicitly provides\ninfluence scores and posterior correlation matrices. An in-depth\ninterpretation of the inversion results is then possible. The more\nobjective quantification of the influence of the observations on the\nfluxes proposed here allows us to evaluate the impact of the\nobservation network on the characterization of the surface fluxes.\nThe explicit correlations between emission aggregates reveal the\nmis-separated regions, hence the typical temporal and spatial scales\nthe inversion can analyse. These scales are consistent with the\nchosen aggregation patterns.",

These processes are particularly relevant in permafrost zones.\nWe also simulate a higher-resolution soil column and deeper soil, and include\nan additional thermal column at the base of the soil to represent bedrock.\nIn addition, the snow scheme was improved to allow it to run with arbitrarily thin layers.\n<br><br>\nPoint-site simulations at Samoylov Island, Siberia, show that the model is\nnow able to simulate soil temperatures and thaw depth much closer to the\nobservations. The root mean square error for the near-surface soil\ntemperatures reduces by approximately 30%, and the active layer thickness\nis reduced from being over 1 m too deep to within 0.1 m of the observed\nactive layer thickness. All of the model improvements contribute to improving\nthe simulations, with organic matter having the single greatest impact. A new\nmethod is used to estimate active layer depth more accurately using the\nfraction of unfrozen water.\n<br><br>\nSoil hydrology and snow are investigated further by holding the soil\nmoisture fixed and adjusting the parameters to make the\nsoil moisture and\nsnow density match better with observations.

Parrenin, L. Bazin, E. Capron, A. Landais, B. Lemieux-Dudon, and V. Masson-Delmotte<br /><br />Polar ice cores provide exceptional archives of past environmental\nconditions. The dating of ice cores and the estimation of the age-scale\nuncertainty are essential to interpret the climate and environmental records\nthat they contain. It is, however, a complex problem which involves different\nmethods. Here, we present IceChrono1, a new probabilistic model integrating\nvarious sources of chronological information to produce a common and\noptimized chronology for several ice cores, as well as its uncertainty.\nIceChrono1 is based on the inversion of three quantities: the surface\naccumulation rate, the lock-in depth (LID) of air bubbles and the thinning\nfunction. The chronological information integrated into the model are\nmodels of the sedimentation process (accumulation of snow, densification of\nsnow into ice and air trapping, ice flow), ice-  and air-dated horizons, ice\nand air depth intervals with known durations, \u0394depth observations\n(depth shift between synchronous events recorded in the ice and in the air)\nand finally air and ice stratigraphic links in between ice cores. The\noptimization is formulated as a least squares problem, implying that all\ndensities of probabilities are assumed to be Gaussian. It is numerically\nsolved using the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm and a numerical evaluation of\nthe model's Jacobian. IceChrono follows an approach similar to that of the\nDatice model which was recently used to produce the AICC2012 (Antarctic ice core chronology) for\nfour Antarctic ice cores and one Greenland ice core. IceChrono1 provides\nimprovements and simplifications with respect to Datice from the\nmathematical, numerical and programming point of views. The capabilities of\nIceChrono1 are demonstrated on a case study similar to the AICC2012 dating\nexperiment. We find results similar to those of Datice, within a few\ncenturies, which is a confirmation of both IceChrono1 and Datice codes. We\nalso test new functionalities with respect to the original version of\nDatice: observations as ice intervals with known durations, correlated\nobservations, observations as air intervals with known durations and\nobservations as mixed ice\u2013air stratigraphic links.

This paper\ndescribes the modification of the widely used land surface model ORCHIDEE for\nstand-scale simulations of SRC plantations.\n<br><br>\nThe model uses weather data, soil texture and species-specific parameters to\npredict the aboveground (harvestable) biomass production, as well as carbon\nand energy fluxes of an SRC plantation.

Biomass yield data were collected from\n23 other sites across Europe and compared to 22 simulations across a\ncomparable geographic range. The simulations show that the model predicts\nvery well aboveground (harvestable) biomass production (within\nmeasured ranges), ecosystem photosynthesis (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.78,\nNRMSE = 0.064, PCC = 0.89) and ecosystem respiration\n(<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.95, NRMSE = 0.078 PCC = 0.91).

In addition, maps of basal heat\nflux and lithology were developed within ECBilt, the atmosphere component of\n<I>i</I>LOVECLIM, so that VAMPER may use spatially varying parameters of geothermal\nheat flux and porosity values. The enhanced VAMPER model is validated by\ncomparing the simulated modern-day extent of permafrost thickness with\nobservations. To perform the simulations, the VAMPER model is forced by\n<I>i</I>LOVECLIM land surface temperatures. Results show that the simulation which\ndid not include the snow cover option overestimated the present permafrost\nextent. However, when the snow component is included, the simulated\npermafrost extent is reduced too much. In analyzing simulated permafrost depths, it was found that most of the modeled thickness values and\nsubsurface temperatures fall within a reasonable range of the corresponding\nobserved values. Discrepancies between simulated and observed permafrost depth distribution are due to\nlack of captured effects from features such as topography and organic soil\nlayers. In addition, some discrepancy is also due to disequilibrium with the\ncurrent climate, meaning that some observed permafrost is a result of colder\nstates and therefore cannot be reproduced accurately with constant\n<I>i</I>LOVECLIM preindustrial forcings.",
