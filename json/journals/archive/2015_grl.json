        "description": "\n\nIt has been suggested previously that the AMOC anomaly associated with changes in the North Atlantic Deep Water formation propagates southward with an advection speed north of 34\u00b0N. In this study, using GFDL CM2.1, we show that this slow southward propagation of the AMOC anomaly is crucial for the evolution and the enhanced decadal predictability of the AMOC fingerprint - the leading mode of upper ocean heat content (UOHC) in the extra-tropical North Atlantic. A positive AMOC anomaly in northern high latitudes leads to a convergence/divergence of the Atlantic meridional heat transport (MHT) anomaly in the subpolar/Gulf Stream region, thus warming in the subpolar gyre (SPG) and cooling in the Gulf Stream region after several years. Recent decadal prediction studies successfully predicted the observed warm shift in the SPG in the mid 1990s. Our results here provide the physical mechanism for the enhanced decadal prediction skills in the SPG UOHC.\n",

Analysis of new (and published) data of the \u03b418O of monsoon rains and vapor at 9 stations shows that in regions of distinct seasonality in precipitation (e.g., peninsular India), the noise in such reconstructions can be minimized by a careful selection of sites. Peninsular India receives rain from both the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the north-east monsoon (NEM). Significant amount effect is observed only where the NEM rainfall is larger than or comparable to ISM rainfall. This is due to the higher quantity of NEM rain with more depleted 18O relative to ISM rain. NEM rain is more depleted in 18O because of cyclonic activity over Bay of Bengal, and the 18O depletion of Bay of Bengal surface waters due to post-ISM river runoff.\n",

They provide methods to rapidly assess earthquakes to predict damaging ground shaking. Preventing false alarms from these systems is key. Here, we developed a simple, robust algorithm, Authorizing GRound shaking for Earthquake Early warning Systems, (AGREEs) to reduce falsely issued alarms. This is a network-threshold-based algorithm, which differs from existing approaches based on apparent velocity of P- and S-waves. AGREEs is designed to function as an external module to support existing earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) and filters out the false events, by evaluating actual shaking near the epicenter. Our retrospective analyses of the 2009 L'Aquila and 2012 Emilia earthquakes show that AGREEs could help an EEWS by confirming the epicentral intensity. Furthermore, AGREEs is able to effectively identify three false events due to a storm, a teleseismic earthquake, and broken sensors in Irpinia Seismic Network, Italy.",

We quantify and describe interactions among driftwood, sedimentation, and vegetation for Great Slave Lake, which is used as proxy for shoreline dynamics and landforms before deforestation and wood removal along major waterways. We introduce driftcretion to describe large, persistent concentrations of driftwood that interact with vegetation and sedimentation to influence shoreline evolution. We report the volume and distribution of driftwood along shorelines, the morphological impacts of driftwood delivery throughout the Holocene, and rates of driftwood accretion. Driftcretions facilitate the formation of complex, diverse morphologies that increase biological productivity and organic carbon capture, and buffer against erosion. Driftcretions should be common on shorelines receiving a large wood supply and with processes which store wood permanently.

A rapid emergence of strongly negative wind stress curl over the Weddell Sea intensifies the cyclonic Weddell gyre and thus causes the relatively warm and salty Weddell Deep Water (WDW) to upwell, generating an open-ocean polynya by melting sea ice or hindering its formation. Once the polynya occurs in the austral winter, the high-salinity of upwelled WDW is combined with not only a cooling by massive heat flux between the relatively warm ocean and the extremely cold winter air but also the ensuing brine rejection due to new ice formation, destabilizing the underlying water column and inducing open-ocean deep convection. Further analysis shows that the buildup of a large heat reservoir at depth by the mid-1970s was a necessary condition to establish the Weddell Polynya of the 1970s.",

To capture this process, we have implemented tsunami-generated gravity waves into the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to construct a three-dimensional physics-based model WP (Wave Perturbation)-GITM. WP-GITM takes tsunami wave properties, including the wave height, wave period, wavelength, and propagation direction, as inputs, and time-dependently characterizes the responses of the upper atmosphere between 100 km and 600 km altitudes. We apply WP-GITM to simulate the ionosphere above the West Coast of the United States around the time when the tsunami associated with the March 2011 Tohuku-Oki earthquke arrived. The simulated TEC perturbations agree with Global Positioning System (GPS) observations reasonably well. For the first time, a fully self-consistent and physics-based model has reproduced the GPS-observed traveling ionospheric signatures of an actual tsunami event.",

The electron trajectories are calculated and weighted using the ESA model for electron flux vs. energy and L. The simulation captures the flux dropout at both GOES-13 and GOES-15 locations after a strong CME-shock arrival which produced a Dst=\u2212132 nT storm, and recovery to the pre-storm value later, consistent with GOES satellite measurements. This study provides the first 3D test-particle simulation combining the trapped and injected populations.

The retreat of sea ice and other changes in recent decades is already warming surface air temperatures in winter. These meteorological changes raise the question of how the seasonal cycle of the ocean may change. Here we present results from coupled climate model simulations showing that the loss of sea ice will dramatically increase the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature in the Arctic Ocean. Depending on the rate of growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases the seasonal range in Arctic sea surface temperature may exceed 10\u00b0C by year 2300, greatly increasing the stratification of the summer mixed layer.",

Observed California winter precipitation is highly correlated to a metric of extratropical cyclone activity over the Eastern Pacific. The lack of precipitation over the recent winters is coincident with consecutive winters of much below average cyclone activity. Analysis of variability in cyclone activity and California precipitation simulated by models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 indicates that most models can simulate the relationship between cyclone activity and precipitation well. Examination of projected change suggests 1) no evidence of a long-term downward trend in California-region cyclone activity within the examined scenarios; and 2) that the inter-model spread in California precipitation projection can be largely explained by the spread in the projection of extratropical cyclone activity. This highlights the need to further understand physical mechanisms for the variation in projection of cyclone activity in this region.",

Here, we show that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with other hydroclimatic variables (soil moisture and sea surface temperature) can be effectively used to predict vegetation anomalies in India. The spatiotemporal analysis of NDVI showed significant greening over the region during the period of 1982\u20132013. The root zone soil moisture showed a positive correlation with NDVI whereas the ENSO index (Nino 3.4) is negatively correlated in most of the regions. We extended this relationship to develop a model to predict NDVI in 1 to 3 months lead time.

Recent work has shown that the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is responsible for phase-locking of peak ENSO development to the boreal winter, suggesting that this annual cycle may play a role in the spring predictability barrier. To test this hypothesis, the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is added to a damped, noise driven conceptual recharge oscillator model. When the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is included, a spring predictability barrier develops whereas without it ENSO predictability is independent of the forecast start date.

Indeed, north of 60\u00b0N, an early and short spring bloom occurs in late April while south of 60\u00b0N, the bloom gradually develops one month later and significant biomass persists all summer long. Nevertheless, at climatological scale, the first-order mechanism that controls the bloom is identical for both bioregions. The light-mixing regime can explain the bloom onset in both bioregions.

Previous seismic studies have used body waves to show that the top ~ 100km of the inner core is isotropic. However, radial anisotropy cannot be uniquely determined by body wave observations. Alternatively, normal mode centre frequencies are sensitive to spherically symmetric Earth structure, therefore may provide a constraint on the existence of radial anisotropy in the inner core. Here we show that normal mode centre frequency measurements are compatible with 2-5% radial anisotropy in the top ~100km of the inner core with a fast direction radially outwards and a slow direction along the ICB. Given the uncertainties in the mineral physics and processes that produce anisotropy, the observed radial anisotropy may be reconciled with predictions based on either solidification processes or from texturing due to anisotropic growth.",

Agreement among reference models is typically within 1 W/M2, while parameterized calculations are roughly half as accurate in the longwave and even less accurate, and more variable, in the shortwave. Absorption of shortwave radiation is underestimated by most parameterizations in the present day and has relatively large errors in forcing. Error in present-day conditions is essentially unrelated to error in forcing calculations. Recent revisions to parameterizations have reduced error in most cases.

Significant increases in aridity do occur in many subtropical, but also adjacent humid regions.

Overall, our experimental, numerical and theoretical results provide evidence for a coupling between the sand-bed topography and the anomalous transport scaling in rivers.

Air-mass transformation over melting sea ice formed a strong, surface-based temperature inversion in which dense fog formed. This induced a positive net longwave radiation at the surface, while reducing net solar radiation only marginally; the inversion also resulted in downward turbulent heat flux. The sum of these processes enhanced the surface energy flux by an average of ~15 W m\u22122 for a week. Satellite images before and after the episode show sea-ice concentrations decreasing from > 90% to ~50% over a large area affected by the air-mass transformation.

However, the physical interpretation of its parameters, e.g., the cementation exponent m, remain questionable. In this study, a theoretical electrical conductivity equation is derived based on the fractal characteristics of porous media. The proposed model is expressed in terms of the tortuosity fractal dimension (DT), the pore fractal dimension (Df), the electrical conductivity of the pore liquid, and the porosity. The empirical parameter m is then determined from physically based parameters, such as DT and Df. Furthermore, a distinct interrelationship between DT and Df is obtained. We find a reasonably good match between the predicted formation factor by our model and experimental data.",

It is found that the current sheet up-down motions are exactly corresponding to alternating hemispherical asymmetries of the bouncing ion population. We show that those hemisphere-asymmetric non-adiabatic ion populations are present in the magnetic field configuration with an effective finite guiding component due to the local current sheet inclination. These results demonstrate that the current sheet flapping motion is a self-organized circulation process between the alternating hemispherical asymmetries of the non-adiabatic ion population inside the plasma sheet and the current sheet equilibrium itself.",

Temperature minima coupled to salinity maxima in late austral summer, into the fall, indicate input from High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW). Secondary temperature minima lacking the high salinity trait, characteristic of Low Salinity Shelf Water (LSSW), appear in the spring. Warmer bottom water similar to modified circumpolar deep water (mCDW) is observed in winter and in early summer. The LSSW and mCDW may be drawn from the Drygalski Basin, as the HSSW pool retreats poleward from the shelf break in response to increased winter polar easterlies allowing these less dense overlying waters to spill into the deep ocean within the benthic layer. Bottom salinity decreased from 2007 to 2011 by 0.007 year\u22121 significantly higher than regional decadal trends, which we propose is a result of HSSW retreat induced by strengthening polar easterlies.",

Here we use an ensemble of projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to develop probabilistic climate information, with and without an accounting of inter-model correlations, for seven regions across the United States. We then use the pdfs to estimate mid-century climate-related risks to a water utility in one of the regions. We show that the variance of climate changes is underestimated across all regions if model correlations are ignored, and in some cases, the mean change shifts as well.

The addition of a middle layer with the uniform potential vorticity weakens vertical coupling between the upper and lower layer that enhances vortex stability and makes the vortex lifespan more realistic. It is demonstrated here that such a three-layer vortex model in so-called compensated state (without rotation in the deep layer) possesses smaller lower interface slope than the two-layer model that reduces the potential vorticity gradient in the lower layer and provides with less unstable configurations. Numerical simulations of an unstable cyclone with parameters typical for cold-core ring Bob reveal strong deformations and pulsations of the vortex core in the two-layer setup, while the ring becomes only slightly deformed and looks stable when the middle layer with uniform potential vorticity is added to be consistent with observations. Enhanced vortex stability in such three-layer setup has important implications for further studies of real-ocean eddies.",

Results show that antecedent soil moisture is as important as concurrent ENSO condition in controlling rainfall anomalies over the U.S., but they generally dominate in different seasons with SST providing more predictability during winter while soil moisture, through its linkages to evapotranspiration and snow water, has larger influence in spring and early summer.

Water-soluble organic carbon in the gas- and particle phases (WSOCg and WSOCp) was measured simultaneously to quantify aqSOA formation in Baltimore, MD. During the nighttime, aqSOA formation was evident as WSOCg increasingly partitioned to the particle phase with increasing relative humidity (RH).

Across the entire RH range encountered, there was no statistically-significant difference in WSOCp concentrations through the dry and ambient channels, indicating that the aqSOA remained in the condensed phase upon the evaporation of aerosol water.

The models exhibit a two-way interaction. While the plume conduit increasingly tilts away from the trench as a result of slab rollback-induced toroidal mantle flow, the slab subduction rate decreases as a function of the amount of plume buoyancy opposing that of the slab, which gets subducted beneath the slab. We propose that our models apply to the Hainan-Manila system and explain the recently imaged tilt of the Hainan plume by the Manila slab-induced mantle return flow.

We extracted surface-to-surface impulse response functions from the ambient seismic field recorded by offshore ocean bottom seismometers located atop the Nankai subduction zone and onshore stations, and showed that these offshore\u2013onshore impulse response functions can be used to accurately simulate the long-period ground motions generated by an offshore moderate subduction earthquake. Moreover, we also found that the distributions of the earthquake and impulse response function pseudo-velocity response spectra have similar maximum amplifications in the same area close to the earthquake epicenter. This suggests that the ambient seismic field recorded by the increasing number of ocean bottom seismometers around the world can be used to assess seismic hazard related to offshore subduction earthquakes without prior knowledge of the velocity structure.",

One particular type of organization is the spatial self-aggregation of convection, taking the form of cloud clusters, or tropical cyclones in the presence of rotation. We show that several physical processes can give rise to self-aggregation, and highlight the key features responsible for it using idealized simulations. Longwave radiative feedbacks yield a \u201cradiative aggregation\" . In that case, sufficient spatial variability of radiative cooling rates yields a low-level circulation, which induces the up-gradient energy transport and radiative-convective instability. Not only do vertically-integrated radiative budgets matter, but the vertical profile of cooling is also crucial. Convective aggregation is facilitated when downdrafts below clouds are weak (\u201cmoisture-memory aggregation\" ), and this is sufficient to trigger aggregation in the absence of longwave radiative feedbacks. These results shed some light on the sensitivity of self-aggregation to various parameters, including resolution or domain size.",

Each simulation is initialized from a unique and dynamically consistent model state sampled from a ~10,000 year fully-coupled equilibrium simulation, which captures the internal unforced variability of the coupled Earth system. We find that internal variability has a sizeable contribution to the modeled ranges of temperature and precipitation. The effects increase for more localized regions.

However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that can significantly influence the rate ofbasal melting of Antarctic marine ice shelves and the associated SLR have not previously been considered. Here we use a fully-coupled global climate model to investigate whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations after a period of global warming could preserve Antarctic ice sheets by cooling subsurface ocean temperatures. We contrast this climate engineering method with an alternative strategy in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract surface and upper level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing GHGs, resulting in continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves, especially in the vicinity of the already unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. By contrast, removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica.",

Recently, it has been proposed that the density and sound velocities, in particular shear wave velocity, in the Earth's inner core are reconciled with Fe7C3, but such properties could be explained by \u03b2-Fe7N3 equally well.

Our results confirm that the barrier may slow down or stop coseismic ruptures, but may also induce supershear ruptures. We demonstrate that the supershear rupture may emerge in a region that is delineated by two approximate linear boundaries. If the barrier size is below the lower boundary, ruptures can overcome the barrier and propagate at subshear speeds. If the barrier size is larger than the upper boundary, ruptures are always stopped by the barrier. Furthermore, we find that the barrier-induced supershear ruptures may eventually slow down into subshear speed, depending on the size and the location of the barrier. The duration of supershear ruptures increases as the barrier sizes grow from the lower to the upper boundary, which are proportional to the reduction in rupture speeds caused by the barrier. These results indicate that a barrier on the fault may not stop coseismic ruptures. Rather, the barrier may induce ruptures propagating at supershear speeds that play important roles in near-field ground shaking and damage.",

To determine the impact of this accelerating meltwater flux on Baffin Bay, we examine 8 numerical experiments using an ocean-sea-ice model: NEMO. Enhanced runoff causes shoreward-increasing sea surface height and strengthens the stratification in Baffin Bay. The changes in sea surface height reduces the southward transport through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and strengthens the gyre circulation within Baffin Bay. The latter leads to further freshening of surface waters as it produces a larger northward surface freshwater transport across Davis Strait. Increasing the meltwater runoff leads to a warming and shallowing of the West Greenland Irminger Water on the northwest Greenland shelf. These warmer waters can now more easily enter fjords on the Greenland coast and thus provide additional heat to accelerate the melting of marine terminating glaciers.",

Previous inversion techniques have been limited by the use of a 1-D Green's function in a free- or half-space, which depends only on the source-receiver distance and neglects volcanic topography. Our method exploits full 3-D Green's functions computed by a numerical method that takes into account realistic topographic scattering. We apply this method to vulcanian eruptions at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Our inversion results produce excellent waveform fits to field observations and demonstrate that full 3-D Green's functions are necessary for accurate volume flux inversion. Conventional inversions without consideration of topographic propagation effects may lead to large errors in the source parameter estimate. The presented inversion technique will substantially improve the accuracy of eruption source parameter estimation (c.f., mass eruption rate) during volcanic eruptions and provide critical constraints for volcanic eruption dynamics and ash dispersal forecasting for aviation safety. Application of this approach to chemical and nuclear explosions will also provide valuable source information (e.g., the amount of energy released) previously unavailable.",

This partly arises from the complex Agulhas leakage, which occurs via rings, cyclones and non-eddy flux. Hindcast simulations suggest leakage has recently increased, but have not decomposed this signal into its constituent mechanisms. Here, these are isolated in a realistic ocean model. Increases in simulated leakage are attributed to stronger eddy and non-eddy driven transports, and a strong warming and salinification, especially within Agulhas rings. Variability in both regimes is associated with strengthening Indian Ocean westerly winds, reflecting an increasingly positive Southern Annular Mode. While eddy and non-eddy flux signals are tied through turbulent eddy dissipation, the ratio between the two varies decadally. Consequently, while altimetry suggests a recent increase in retroflection turbulence and implied leakage, non-eddy flux may also play a significant role in modulating the leakage-AMOC connection.",

The resulting simulation implies a decline of Hg in the Arctic surface ocean that we estimate to be -0.67% yr-1 over the study period.

We develop a new method using the passive tracer spice, to estimate Agulhas leakage transport in an ocean eddy-resolving climate model that properly captures Agulhas Retroflection and leakage. We identify Agulhas leakage waters as positive spice anomalies (\u2265\u2009+0.1) and are able to trace leakage to depths greater than 1000\u2009m. Spice-based Eulerian Agulhas leakage captures spikes in Lagrangian leakage transport which coincide with the passage of Agulhas rings, yielding a statistically significant correlation (0.47). On interannual times scales, differences between Eulerian and Lagrangian transports are reduced and correlation increases to 0.77. We obtain a mean spice-based Eulerian Agulhas leakage of 17\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009sverdrup (Sv) and Lagrangian Agulhas leakage of 18\u2009\u00b1\u20092 Sv, which are within the range of observational estimates.",

The Swarm orbit in the early phase of the mission gives us the unique opportunity of sequencing the temporal evolution of the observed field-aligned current system in the nightside, near magnetic local midnight. These field-aligned currents are seen to move poleward through the radar field of view and to affect the observed ionosphere. The upward field-aligned current (FAC) is responsible, at least in part, for the heating of the ionospheric electrons. It is less clear whether the downward FAC cools the ionosphere. We use the TRANSCAR model of the ionosphere to quantify the thermoelectric effect that comes into play. Finally, we compare the plasma parameters measured by the Langmuir probe on board Swarm and the ESR and conclude on an agreement within the errors.",

Here we explore warming-elevation relationships using records from 2660 meteorological stations and determine that the vertical gradient of warming rate varies with location. The warming is faster at higher altitudes in Asia and western North America, but the opposite is observed over Central Europe and eastern North America which have received more short-wave radiation (brightening) associated with a decrease of aerosols and clouds since the 1980s. We found that altitudinal differences in air pollution (brightening), with observations showing more short-wave radiation received at low altitudes than at mountains, modulate the warming-elevation relationships.

The observed spatial pattern of surface displacements can only be reproduced by finite element models of postseismic deformation in elastic over viscoelastic crust that include lateral differences in both the thickness of the elastic layer and the viscosity of the viscoelastic layer. Solutions reproducing the sign of horizontal displacements everywhere in the epicentral region also require afterslip on the portion of the fault dislocation in the viscoelastic layer but not in the elastic lid. Although there are substantial tradeoffs among contributions to postseismic displacements of the surface, the observations preclude both crustal homogeneity and shallow afterslip. In the best family of solutions, the thickness of the elastic upper crust differs by a factor of 5 and the viscosity of the middle and lower crust by an order of magnitude between domains north and south of a suture zone containing the Main Boundary Thrust and Main Mantle Thrust.",

Herein, we present evidence that these correlations are not causal but instead result from the advection of heat, salt, and nutrients in the region. Specifically, we demonstrate that stratification and chlorophyll are simultaneously influenced by shifts in the horizontal advective inputs of cold/saline/nutrient-rich waters from upwelling regions to the east and warm/fresh/nutrient-poor waters to the west. We find that horizontal advection contributes substantially to the annual surface layer nutrient budget and, together with vertical advection, significantly impacts interannual variability in chlorophyll.

We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that examines a broad range of Xe isotopic components present during Earth formation and evolution. Our best fit simulations are consistent with the preservation of much higher Pu/U in MORB source Xe than previously recognized but are equally supportive of both limited and early catastrophic loss.

Recent studies show that the influence of the snow cover is not negligible and can highly affect the CryoSat-2 range retrievals if it is assumed that the main scattering horizon is given by the snow-ice interface. Our analysis of Arctic ice mass balance buoy records and coincident CryoSat-2 data between 2012 and 2014 adds observational evidence to these findings. Linear trends of snow and ice freeboard measurements from buoys and nearby CryoSat-2 freeboard retrievals are calculated during accumulation events.

In this paper, precipitation (P), evaporation (E), and runoff (R) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global models were evaluated against observational products. The forecasts differ substantially from observed data for key hydrological variables. In addition, imbalanced surface water budgets, mostly caused by data assimilation, were found on both global (P-E) and basin scales (P-E-R), with the latter being more important.

Thermocline depth anomalies have been found to lead SST anomalies in time with a longitude-dependent delay, but our study also suggests that the relationship shows considerable seasonal dependency and is strongest (weakest) during the boreal spring (summer). Over the eastern equatorial Pacific where there is least delay (compared to that in the western and central Pacific), the connection between thermocline and SST is the weakest during the boreal spring. This feature may be one of causes for ENSO spring persistence barrier. Furthermore, the thermocline-SST connections exhibit significant decadal variations, which are remarkably consistent with the decadal changes in the persistence barrier of SST anomalies over the eastern Pacific. It is also found that the decadal shift in the timing of the thermocline-SST connection barrier is caused by the changes in the seasonal cycle of tropical trade winds and thermocline depths.",

        "description": "\n\nWe investigate the mechanisms controlling the evolution of Southern Ocean carbon storage under a future climate warming scenario. A subset of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models predicts that the inventory of biologically sequestered carbon south of 40\u00b0S increases about 18\u201334\u2009Pg\u2009C by 2100 relative to the preindustrial condition. Sensitivity experiments with an ocean circulation and biogeochemistry model illustrates the impacts of the wind and buoyancy forcings under a warming climate. Intensified and poleward shifted westerly wind strengthens the upper overturning circulation, not only leading to an increased uptake of anthropogenic CO2 but also releasing biologically regenerated carbon to the atmosphere. Freshening of Antarctic Surface Water causes a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to an increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage. The rectified effect of these processes operating together is the sustained growth of the carbon storage in the Southern Ocean, even under the warming climate with a weaker global ocean carbon uptake.",

The magnetic perturbation ahead of them, often referred to as a dipolarization front (DF), is asymmetric with a small Bz dip followed by a sharp Bz enhancement. The Bz dip is thought to be generated from dawnward currents carried by DF-reflected ions; after reflection, these earthward moving ions gyrate clockwise and contribute to dawnward diamagnetic currents ahead of the front. Using observations of hundreds of DFs, we investigate this hypothesis. We find that the depth of the Bz dip as a function of the front azimuth depends on DF propagation speed and ambient plasma density. These statistical signatures support the hypothesis that the Bz dip is caused by ion reflection and suggest that secondary currents carried by these reflected ions can reshape the front significantly.",

The topographic alignment of salt deposits has been speculated to indicate an endogenic sourcing of the material. Two-way transport of salts from a liquid-water ocean beneath the ice shell to the surface, and vice versa, has been speculated. We present dynamical models that demonstrate the incorporation of newly frozen ice into convective plumes within the ice shell, caused by convection within the ice shell that drives dynamic topography along the ice-ocean boundary. The new ice that forms at the freezing front can be transported by the rising ice plumes toward the surface until it is blocked by a high-viscosity lid at the surface. Weakening of the lid by tidal or tectonic forces could then lead to the surface detection of ocean trace chemistry captured in the newly formed ice.",

In northeast Tibet, depth-consistent NW-SE directions imply coupled deformation throughout the whole lithosphere, possibly also involving the underlying asthenosphere. Significant anisotropy at depths of 225\u2009km in southeast Tibet reflects sublithospheric deformation induced by northward and eastward lithospheric subduction beneath the Himalaya and Burma, respectively.

Changes in ring width, however, have recently been shown to bias the ratio between low- and high-frequency signals. To overcome limitations in capturing the full spectrum of past temperature variability, we present a network of 15 maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies distributed across the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Independent subsets of continental-scale records consistently reveal high MXD before 1580 and after 1910, with below average values between these periods. Reconstructed extratropical summer temperatures reflect not only these long-term trends but also distinct cooling pulses after large volcanic eruptions. In contrast to TRW-dominated reconstructions, this MXD-based record indicates a delayed onset of the Little Ice Age by almost two centuries. The reduced memory inherent in MXD is likely responsible for the rapid recovery from volcanic-induced cooling in the fourteenth century and the continuation of warmer temperatures until ~1600.",

However, much uncertainty remains about how land surface fluxes influence the initiation of deep convection locally. While some studies consider only atmospheric and soil profiles, in a one-dimensional sense, others have argued that horizontal variability in fluxes plays an important role in convective triggering, via mesoscale circulations. This paper presents the first comprehensive observational analysis over Europe linking convective initiation to soil moisture, based on satellite observations of cloud top and land surface temperature, and soil moisture. The results show that convective initiations are favored on the downwind side of dry surfaces, close to wetter areas. The signal is clearest following dry periods and under light winds, consistent with forcing by a mesoscale circulation. Overall, the detected signal in Europe is weaker than in previous Sahelian analysis, but key spatial characteristics are essentially the same.",

Specifically, we show how microzones favorable to anaerobic respiration processes (e.g., denitrification, metal reduction, and methanogenesis) can develop in the embedded less mobile porosity of bulk-oxic hyporheic zones. Anoxic microzones develop when transport time from the streambed to the pore center exceeds a characteristic uptake time of oxygen. A two-dimensional pore-network model was used to quantify how anoxic microzones develop across a range of hyporheic flow and oxygen uptake conditions. Two types of microzones develop: flow invariant and flow dependent. The former is stable across variable hydrologic conditions, whereas the formation and extent of the latter are sensitive to flow rate and orientation. Therefore, pore-scale residence time heterogeneity, which can now be evaluated in situ, offers a simple explanation for anaerobic signals occurring in oxic pore waters.",

A new measure that considers the timing of processes is suggested for evaluating the optimal conditions for maximum rain yield. These conditions are linked to an optimal aerosol concentration (Nrain_op), which drives similar time intervals to maximum collected mass and to maximum vertical development. Nrain_op is a function of cloud size and thermodynamic conditions. Giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) impact was shown before to precede the initiation of collision-coalescence and to increase the amount of rain from polluted clouds. Here we show that the GCCN effect is important only under aerosol conditions above Nrain_op.",

In our simulations, normal faults initiate within the outer rise region and reach maximum throw toward the trench. This result holds over a wide range of tectonic forcing and is consistent with observations of the Challenger Deep region, where multibeam bathymetry data indicate faults initiate near the outer rise at 70\u2013110\u2009km from the trench and reach maximum throw at 10\u201335\u2009km from the trench.

When the dipole moment is perpendicular to the surface, large positive potentials (close to ion flow energies in eV) are measured on the surface in the dipole lobe regions, charged by the unmagnetized ions while the electrons are magnetically excluded. The potential decreases exponentially with distance from the surface on the ion (flow) Debye length scale. The surface potentials become much smaller when the dipole moment is parallel to the surface, likely due to collisionality.

For the elevation range investigated (1295\u20132256\u2009m), and assuming an average atmospheric lapse rate of \u22126.5\u00b0C/km, we find a mostly linear relationship between effective elevation and correlation of temperature or precipitation with snow water equivalent and snowpack duration.

The TTD shape parameter \u0394/\u0393 is thus larger in the SH tropics than at middle and high SH latitudes. Our analysis introduces a simple path-dependent lifetime that parameterizes chemical losses. The path-dependent lifetimes are estimated for CFC replacements, and systematic differences between path-dependent and global lifetimes are interpreted.

Over the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the cumulative CO2-radiative forcing exceeds the amount of energy released upon combustion by a factor >100,000. For a new power plant, the radiative forcing from the accumulation of released CO2 exceeds the direct thermal emissions in less than half a year.

This is at odds with observed high N2 fixation rates in the oligotrophic North Atlantic where the ratio of nutrients supplied to the surface is elevated in N relative to the average R (16:1). In this study, we investigate several mechanisms to solve this puzzle: iron limitation, phosphorus enhancement by preferential remineralization or stoichiometric diversity of phytoplankton, and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) utilization. Combining resource competition theory and a global coupled ecosystem-circulation model, we find that the additional N and energy investments required for exoenzymatic breakdown of DOP give N2 fixers a competitive advantage in oligotrophic P-starved regions. Accounting for this mechanism expands the ecological niche of N2 fixers also to regions where the nutrient supply is high in N relative to R, yielding, in our model, a pattern consistent with the observed high N2 fixation rates in the oligotrophic North Atlantic.",

They are abundant through space and occur in packets of hundreds in the outer Van Allen radiation belts where they produce magnetic-field-aligned electron pitch angle distributions at energies up to a hundred keV. TDS can provide the seed electrons that are later accelerated to relativistic energies by whistlers and they also produce field-aligned electrons that may be responsible for some types of auroras. These field-aligned electron distributions result from at least three processes. The first process is parallel acceleration by Landau trapping in the TDS parallel electric field. The second process is Fermi acceleration due to reflection of electrons by the TDS. The third process is an effective and rapid pitch angle scattering resulting from electron interactions with the perpendicular and parallel electric and magnetic fields of many TDS. TDS are created by current-driven and beam-related instabilities and by whistler-related processes such as parametric decay of whistlers and nonlinear evolution from oblique whistlers. New results on the temporal relationship of TDS and particle injections, types of field-aligned electron pitch angle distributions produced by TDS, the mechanisms for generation of field-aligned distributions by TDS, the maximum energies of field-aligned electrons created by TDS in the absence of whistler mode waves, TDS generation by oblique whistlers and three-wave-parametric decay, and the correlation between TDS and auroral particle precipitation, are presented.",

The Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the NASA Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite has been measuring thermospheric cooling by NO for over 13\u2009years. In this letter we show that the SABER time series of globally integrated infrared power (watts) radiated by NO can be replicated accurately by a multiple linear regression fit using the F10.7, Ap, and Dst indices. This allows reconstruction of the NO power time series back nearly 70\u2009years with extant databases of these indices. The relative roles of solar ultraviolet and geomagnetic processes in determining the NO cooling are derived and shown to vary significantly over the solar cycle. The NO power is a fundamental integral constraint on the thermospheric climate, and the time series presented here can be used to test upper atmosphere models over seven different solar cycles.",

The Cluster signatures are interpreted and ordered through joint mapping of the ground/magnetospheric footprints and estimation of the auroral zone boundaries (taken as indication of the boundaries of Region 1 and Region 2 currents). We find clear evidence of both small-scale and large-scale FACs and clear matching of the behavior and structure of the large-scale currents at both Cluster and Swarm. The methodology is made possible through the joint operations of Cluster and Swarm, which contain, in the first several months of Swarm operations, a number of close three-spacecraft configurations.",

A total of 26 events were found during which an Earth-like growth phase was followed by clear near-tail expansion phase signatures. During the growth phase, just as at Earth, the thinning of the plasma sheet and the increase of the magnetic field intensity in the lobe are observed, but the fractional increase in field intensity could be \u223c3 to 5 times that at Earth. The average timescale of the growth phase is \u223c1\u2009min. The dipolarization that marks the initiation of the substorm expansion phase is only a few seconds in duration. During the expansion phase, lasting \u223c1\u2009min, the plasma sheet is observed to thicken and engulf the spacecraft. The duration of the substorm observed in this paper is consistent with previous observations of Mercury's Dungey cycle. The reconfiguration of the magnetotail during Mercury's substorm is very similar to that at Earth despite its very compressed timescale.",

Using data from five Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) probes, we reconstruct these profiles with the help of an empirical model and apply thin filament theory to show that the oscillatory flow braking can occur in an asymmetric potential. Thus, the thin filament oscillations appear to be anharmonic, with a power spectrum exhibiting peaks at both the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic. Such anharmonic oscillatory braking can explain the presence of the first harmonic in Pi2 pulsations (frequency doubling), which are simultaneously observed by magnetometers on the ground near the conjugate THEMIS footprints.",

Some of them are associated with whistler waves. Such TDS often emerge on the forward edges of the whistler wave packets and form chains. The parametric decay of a whistler wave into a whistler wave propagating in the opposite direction and an electron acoustic wave is studied experimentally as well as analytically, using Van Allen Probes data. The resulting electron acoustic wave is considered to be the source of electron scale TDS. The measured parameters of the three waves (two whistlers and the electron acoustic wave) are in good agreement with an assumption of their parametric interaction: \u03c90=\u03c91+\u03c92 and k0=k1+k2. The bicoherence analysis shows the nonlinear nature of the observed electron-acoustic waves as well as the whistler wave and electron acoustic wave phase relation. The estimated decay instability growth rate shows that the process of three-wave interaction can develop in a characteristic time smaller than 1\u2009s, thus, the process is rapid enough to explain the observations. This induced parametric interaction can be one of the mechanisms for quasiperiodic TDS generation in the outer Van Allen radiation belt.",

Here we employ observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, taking advantage of improved vertical coverage in MCS's aerosol retrievals, to discover a new class of extreme detached dust layers (EDDLs). Observed during minimal dust storm activity and furthermore distinguished by their potentially large and measurable horizontal extent (>1000\u2009km), these EDDLs cluster near Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes, from which they likely originate.

After 170\u2009h irradiation, samples analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) showed ClO4\u2212 and ClO3\u2212 present in all samples. When SiO2 was added, yield increased from 2 to 42\u2009nmol and 0.4 to 2.6\u2009nmol, respectively. We attribute this to SiO2 and metal oxides acting as photocatalysts, generating O2\u2212 radicals from O2 which react with chloride. Results show ClO4\u2212 and ClO3\u2212 can be produced photochemically on Cl minerals without atmospheric chlorine or aqueous conditions, and explain high concentration of ClO4\u2212 and ClO4\u2212/Cl\u2212 ratios detected by Phoenix.

Using MESSENGER orbital high-incidence angle imaging and topographic data, large-scale lobate thrust fault scarps have been mapped globally. The spatial distribution and areal density of the contractional landforms are not uniform; concentrations occur in longitudinal bands and between the north and south hemispheres. Their orientations are generally north-south at low latitude to midlatitude and east-west at high latitudes. The spatial distribution and distribution of orientations of these large-scale contractional features suggest that planet-wide contraction due to interior cooling cannot be the sole source of global stresses. The nonrandom orientations are best explained by a combination of stresses from global contraction and tidal despinning combined with an equator-to-pole variation in lithospheric thickness, while the nonuniform areal density of the contractional features may indicate the influence of mantle downwelling or heterogeneities in lithospheric strength.",

With over a decade of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, we were able to measure and model the unanticipated large coseismic and postseismic gravity changes of these events. Using the approach of normal mode decomposition and spatial localization, we computed the gravity changes corresponding to five moment tensor components. Our analysis revealed that the gravity changes are produced predominantly by coseismic compression and dilatation within the oceanic crust and upper mantle and by postseismic vertical motion. Our results suggest that the postseismic positive gravity and the postseismic uplift measured with GPS within the coseismic compressional quadrant are best fit by ongoing uplift associated with viscoelastic mantle relaxation. Our study demonstrates that the GRACE data are suitable for analyzing strike-slip earthquakes as small as Mw 8.2 with the noise characteristics of this region.",

However, the factors controlling the development of SP curvature are not well understood. We use numerical models to quantify the role of SP rheology on the minimum radius of curvature, Rmin. We find that Rmin depends strongly on the SP thickness when the rheology is viscous. This dependence is substantially reduced when the SP behaves plastically, in line with the lack of correlation between Rmin and SP thickness on Earth. In contrast, plasticity leads to a strong positive correlation between Rmin and the overriding plate (OP) thickness. Using an analysis of Rmin versus OP thickness, we show that such a positive correlation exists on Earth. This suggests that OP structure, in conjunction with SP plasticity, is crucial in generating slab curvature systematics on Earth.",

Moreover, the dimensions are higher than the theoretically estimated upper fractal limit under confined comminution. Dimensions close to 3.0 have been reported in impact loading experiments.

Here we examine a large global data set of PKP precursors in individual seismograms and array data, to better understand scattering locations. The precursor amplitudes from individual seismograms are analyzed with respect to the inner core phase PKIKP and mantle phase PP. We find and correct for a hemispherical asymmetry in the precursor/PKIKP amplitudes, resulting from inner core structure. Using ray tracing, we locate scatterers in our array data and use these to infer scattering locations in the individual data. The scattering strength displays regional variation; however, we find no relationship with long-scale core-mantle boundary velocity structure. Scattering is observed in all regions of data coverage, as are paths with no precursors. This indicates that scattering occurs from various small-scale heterogeneities, including but not limited to ultralow velocity zones or partial melt, and slabs.",

In eastern Phanerozoic Australia the estimated depths of the LAT tie well with those from receiver functions. However, in the Archean and Proterozoic lithosphere in western and central Australia, the LAT derived from the surface wave model is generally much deeper than the discontinuities recognized from receiver functions and shows a smooth transition. There is significant radial anisotropy (SH\u2009>\u2009SV) in the upper lithosphere as well as in the LAT and the underlying asthenosphere. Strong anisotropy in the asthenosphere reflects the effects of present shear flow in the mantle beneath the continent. The lateral variation of lithospheric anisotropy correlates well with the suture zones between cratonic blocks, representing frozen anisotropy associated with the ancient tectonics of Australia.",

They are usually thought to be associated with resonating fluid-filled conduits although alternative models involving material failure have recently been proposed. Through recent field experiments, we uncovered a step-like displacement component associated with some LP events, outside the spectral range of the typically narrow-band analysis for this kind of event. Bespoke laboratory experiments with step tables show that steps of the order of a few micrometers can be extracted from seismograms, where long-period noise is estimated and removed with moving median filters. Using these constraints, we observe step-like ground deformation in LP recordings near the summits of Turrialba and Etna Volcanoes.

The setup is constituted and scaled down to natural gravity field using a thin viscous sheet model, with mantle and lithosphere simulated by Newtonian viscous glucose syrup and silicon putty, respectively. The surface process is simulated assuming a simple erosion law producing the downhill flow of a thin viscous material away from high topography.

There, specific environmental conditions (steep slopes, snow- or ice-capped summit, dense vegetation cover, and strong tropospheric artifacts) and limited amount of radar data available make it challenging to accurately measure ground surface displacement with InSAR. To overcome these difficulties, we first performed a careful analysis of the water vapor variations using Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-infrared water vapor products and then we inverted wrapped interferograms for both topographic correlated phase delays and a simple model source strength. In the light of our results, we conclude that there is no detectable ground displacement related to a deep magmatic source for the 2003\u20132011 period and that most of the fringes observed in the interferograms were produced by tropospheric delays.",

Seismic tomography may be employed to map the accumulation of subsurface bubble-bearing fluids to help mitigating such hazards. Nevertheless, how gas bubbles modify seismic waves is still unclear. We show that saturated rocks strongly attenuate seismic waves when gas bubbles occupy part of the pore space. Laboratory measurements of elastic wave attenuation at frequencies <100\u2009Hz are modeled with a dynamic gas dissolution theory demonstrating that the observed frequency-dependent attenuation is caused by wave-induced-gas-exsolution-dissolution (WIGED). This result is incorporated into a numerical model simulating the propagation of seismic waves in a subsurface domain containing CO2-gas bubbles. This simulation shows that WIGED can significantly modify the wavefield and illustrates how accounting for this physical mechanism can potentially improve the monitoring and surveying of gas bubble-bearing fluids in the subsurface.",

While initial and final states have been well described before, here we image the dynamic transient process in a sandstone rock using fast synchrotron-based X-ray computed microtomography. Wetting film swelling and subsequent snap off, at unusually high saturation, decreases nonwetting phase connectivity, which leads to nonwetting phase fragmentation into mobile ganglia, i.e., ganglion dynamics regime. We find that in addition to pressure-driven connected pathway flow, mass transfer in the oil phase also occurs by a sequence of correlated breakup and coalescence processes. For example, meniscus oscillations caused by snap-off events trigger coalescence of adjacent clusters. The ganglion dynamics occurs at the length scale of oil clusters and thus represents an intermediate flow regime between pore and Darcy scale that is so far dismissed in most upscaling attempts.",

We induce different solar radiation patterns in a Swiss Alpine catchment through virtual rotations of the digital elevation model. Streamflow simulations are performed at different spatial scales through a spatially explicit hydrological model coupled to a physically based snow model. Results highlight that the effects of solar radiation patterns on the hydrologic response are scale dependent, i.e., significant at small scales with predominant aspects and weak at larger scales where aspects become uncorrelated and orientation differences average out. Such scale dependence proves relevant for the spatial transferability of a temperature-index model, whose calibrated degree-day factors are stable to different solar radiation patterns for catchment sizes larger than the aspect correlation scale.",

In this study, we used simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archives to investigate changes in the annual range of soil water storage under global warming at northern middle and high latitudes. Results show that future warming could lead to significant declines in snowfall, and a corresponding lack of snowmelt water recharge to the soil, which makes soil water less available during spring and summer. Conversely, more precipitation as rainfall results in higher recharge to soil water during its accumulating season. Thus, the wettest month of soil water gets wetter, and the driest month gets drier, resulting in an increase of the annual range and suggesting that stronger heterogeneity in global water distribution (changing extremes) could occur under global warming; this has implications for water management and water security under a changing climate.",

We investigate the change in CryoSat-2 waveforms and elevation estimates over the melt event and interpret the findings by comparing in situ surface and snow pit observations from the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling Project camp. The investigation shows a major transition of scattering properties around the area, and an apparent elevation increase of 56 \u00b1 26\u2009cm is observed in reprocessed CryoSat-2 data.

The elevation-surface mass balance feedback contributes to future GrIS mass loss with 8\u201311% (by 2100), depending on the forcing scenario, and 24\u201331% (by 2300).

In this study we focused on a specific event type occurring close to the grounding line of the Ekstr\u00f6m ice shelf. Observed waveform characteristics are consistent with an initial fracturing followed by the resonance of a water-filled cavity resulting in a so-called hybrid event. The number of events detected strongly correlates with dominant tide periods. We assume the cracking to be driven by existing glacier stresses trough bending. Voids are then filled by seawater, exciting the observed resonance.

This observed polarity conversion at a fixed location is caused by the vertical stratification variation mainly induced by the rising tide, which is believed to be the first reported observation of this kind.

Here using a high-resolution tide model, we estimate that global energy fluxes below 200\u2009m depth were almost quadrupled during the LGM. Applying the energy fluxes to a consistent tidal mixing parameterization of a global climate model results in a large intensification of mixing. Global mean vertical diffusivity increases by more than a factor of 3, and consequently, the simulated meridional overturning circulation accelerates by ~21\u201346%. In the model, these effects are at least as important as those from changes in surface boundary conditions. Our findings contrast with the prevailing view that the abyssal LGM circulation was more sluggish. We conclude that changes in tidal mixing are an important mechanism that may have strongly increased the glacial deep ocean circulation and should no longer be neglected in paleoclimate simulations.",

The hourly buoy data are decimated every 9.9\u2009day to emulate altimeter measurements. The altimeter and decimated buoy data are highly coherent at the aliased semidiurnal period (~60\u2009day), and they agree well for the stationary semidiurnal internal tide. For the nonstationary internal tide, which consists of a significant annual cycle, the demodulated amplitude from the altimeter appears to be contaminated by nontidal signals. The demodulated amplitude from the decimated buoy data, on the other hand, is capable of resolving the temporal variability. This suggests the potential of mapping nonstationary internal tides from satellites.",

Our results demonstrated that anoxic stress is one of important \u201cenvironmental factors\u201d in the marine DMS dynamics, suggesting the possible global importance due to ubiquity of anoxic conditions in the coastal oceans.

The positive relative vorticity and potential vorticity on the cyclonic side of the Gulf Stream are strongly intensified in the Straits due to topographic drag along the continental slope. The bottom drag amplifies the cyclonic shear by generating large positive vertical vorticity values within the sloped turbulent bottom boundary layer. Downstream from the Straits the current becomes unstable to horizontal shear instability, rolls up, and forms a street of submesoscale vortices. The vortices expand as they propagate northward along the shelf, where they can generate large vertical displacements and enhance cross-shelf exchanges.",

A series of experiments on the lateral instability of monochromatic, deep water, unidirectional, initially long-crested steep waves was performed in a large wave basin. The cross modulation of wave crests is clearly visible; its magnitude depends on the wave steepness in the wave propagation direction. Its spatial scale is comparable with the wavelength.

Here we show that the double-ITCZ bias and ECS in 44 GCMs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 3/5 are negatively correlated. The models with weak (strong) double-ITCZ biases have high (low)-ECS values of ~4.1(2.2)\u00b0C.

        "description": "\n\nIntermodel variations in future precipitation projection in the North Atlantic are studied using 23 state-of-art models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Model uncertainty in annual mean rainfall change is locally enhanced along the Gulf Stream. The moisture budget analysis reveals that much of the model uncertainty in rainfall change can be traced back to the discrepancies in surface evaporation change and transient eddy effect among models. Results of the intermodel Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis show that intermodel variations in local sea surface temperature (SST) pattern exert a strong control over the spread of rainfall projection among models through the modulation of evaporation change. The first three SVD modes explain more than 60% of the intermodel variance of rainfall projection and show distinct SST patterns with mode water-induced banded structures, reduced subpolar warming due to ocean dynamical cooling, and the Gulf Stream shift, respectively.",

        "description": "\nIn view of the scientific and social implications, the global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) and its possible causes and future trend have been a challenge for so long. For the twentieth century, reconstructions generally indicate a rate of GMSLR in the range of 1.5 to 2.0\u2009mm\u2009yr\u22121. However, the existence of nonlinear trends is still debated, and current estimates of the secular acceleration are subject to ample uncertainties. Here we use various GMSLR estimates published on scholarly journals since the 1940s for a heuristic assessment of global sea level acceleration. The approach, alternative to sea level reconstructions, is based on simple statistical methods and exploits the principles of meta-analysis. Our results point to a global sea level acceleration of 0.54 \u00b1 0.27\u2009mm/yr/century (1\u03c3) between 1898 and 1975. This supports independent estimates and suggests that a sea level acceleration since the early 1900s is more likely than currently believed.",

Such data, closely linked to strong humidity gradients accompanying severe weather phenomena, are considered a new important data source for meteorological studies, e.g., nowcasting of severe rainfall events. Here we describe the development of a multi-GNSS processing system for the precise retrieval of high-resolution tropospheric gradients. The retrieved products were validated by using independent water vapor radiometer (WVR) observations and numerical weather model (NWM) data. The multi-GNSS high-resolution gradients agree well with those, derived from NWM and WVR, especially for the fast-changing peaks which were mostly associated with synoptic fronts. Compared to GPS-only gradients, the correlations with the validation data are significantly improved up to 20\u201335%. The new data product has significant potential to improve numerical weather prediction and to advance meteorological studies.",

The whole data set indicates a wide range of OA oxidation and a trajectory in the Van Krevelen diagram, characterized by a slope of \u22120.6, with variation across campaigns. We show that laboratory OA including both source and aged types explains some of the key differences in OA observed across different environments. However, the laboratory data typically fall below the mean line defined by ambient observations, and little laboratory data extend to the highest O:C ratios commonly observed in remote conditions. OA having both high O:C and high H:C are required to bridge the gaps. Aqueous-phase oxidation may produce such OA, but experiments under realistic ambient conditions are needed to constrain the relative importance of this pathway.",

        "description": "\nFuture changes in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors will likely impact seasonal vegetative ozone exposure, W126, in the western U.S. To investigate this, source-receptor relationships are calculated with the GEOS-Chem adjoint model and are separated by location, species, and sector. These are used to project changes in W126 through midcentury following representative concentration pathway (RCP) emissions. The overall behavior of W126 is governed by declining domestic emissions. However, foreign emissions of NOx, non-methane volatile organic compounds, and CO and CH4 abundance can either slow or enhance this trend, depending on scenario. The relative importance of foreign emissions increases as U.S. emissions decline, and, in some cases, the contribution of foreign sources exceeds that of domestic as early as 2020. In 2050, W126 in the western U.S. contributed by Chinese emissions alone, dominated by the industrial sector, is up to 15% higher than in 2000, although such estimates are strongly dependent on scenario.",

Most of these studies have utilized the Wheeler-Hendon index. This index is only available since 1974, the period over which remotely sensed outgoing longwave radiation data has been available. Our study utilizes a long reconstructed MJO index, based on surface pressures, which extends back to 1905. We document consistent modulation of tropical cyclone activity by the MJO in all basins over this time period. These modulations are shown to be remarkably stable over the entire analysis period.

These fields can map to higher altitudes along the geomagnetic field lines and have been proposed as the mechanism for generation of whistler ducts. Previous 2-D modeling of these fields have been limited to azimuthally symmetric cases which requires a vertical magnetic field. We have developed a 3-D model of the electrostatic thundercloud fields which allows the consideration of effects of the geomagnetic field dip angle on the mapping of the fields to high altitudes. The results show stronger electric fields at altitudes of 70\u2013110\u2009km with an equatorward and eastward shift of tens of kilometers at lower geomagnetic latitudes. These stronger fields are mapped into the magnetosphere and may therefore be important for whistler duct generation. The fields also indicate a more significant contribution of the quiescent heating on VLF early/fast events.",

Composites of the nitrous oxide (N2O) anomalies calculated for westerly and easterly phases show that QBO-generated variability originating in the subtropical middle stratosphere fills the midlatitude surf zone by late winter. After the spring vortex breakup, the anomaly is transported to the Antarctic where it remains until the next vortex forms in fall. Trapped in the newly formed vortex, the anomaly descends in isolation through fall and winter, arriving in the Antarctic lower stratosphere in September\u2014about 1\u2009year after it formed. This transport pathway explains previously reported variability of N2O and inorganic chlorine (Cly) inside the Antarctic vortex and demonstrates that the middle stratosphere QBO affects ozone depletion by modulating Antarctic Cly.",

An environmental index based on convective available potential energy and storm relative helicity shows power at the same frequencies. Reconstruction of the normalized tornado counts and the environmental index at these frequencies provides a time-filtered description of their seasonal variation. Onset and peak dates of the tornado season defined from the reconstruction are significantly correlated with those of the environmental index over the period 1979\u20132013 and are found to have trends of \u22123.7 and \u22123.8\u2009days/decade, respectively.

Flash energy spectra were calculated from lightning mapping data collected during the eruption. The spectra were compared to the turbulence characteristics expected from each stage of plume development. Small flash length scales present at early times were associated with the gas thrust and initial convective stages. Increases in flash length scales and flash energy as the explosive events progressed were associated with an increase in volume of the plume. Spectra with a large range in flash length scales (0.2\u201310\u2009km) and a spectral peak at small flash length scales (< 1\u2009km) were associated with a superposition of spectra from gas thrust, convective, and umbrella/ash cloud regions. An approximate 5/3 power law slope was observed on the order of 10\u2009min after gas thrust forcing had ended and the transition to a drifting ash cloud was underway, which may reflect the dissipating state of the drifting ash cloud.",

Asian air reaches the extratropical tropopause within a few days of leaving the boundary layer and is quasi-horizontally transported into the tropical lower stratosphere, where it persists until January. The rapid injection of Asian air into the lower stratosphere\u2014and its persistence in the deep tropics through late (boreal) winter\u2014is important as industrial emissions over East Asia continue to increase.
