        "description": "\n\nProjected decreases and changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation will have profound impacts on southeastern Australia, including its ability to generate renewable hydroelectricity. Recent decreases in precipitation over the region may be significant in the context of instrumental records, but the question of whether these decreases are within long-term natural variability remains. To help address this issue, we present December-January streamflow and dam inflow reconstructions for southeastern Australia. These reconstructions for the Tasmanian west coast are based solely on local tree-ring chronologies and span up to 1600 years. Non-parametric estimates, however, indicate good model skill for the last 458 years (streamflow) and 478 years (dam inflow). The reconstructions indicate that 20th century conditions were well within the range of historical variability, and were in fact relatively wet. The period from ca. 1600 \u2013 1750 CE was one of enhanced variability and a high proportion of low and high flow events occurred in the 17th century. There are significant relationships between streamflow and inflow reconstructions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere processes such as ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode. Critically, our two reconstructions rely heavily on new tree-ring chronologies based on properties such as tracheid radial diameter, cell wall thickness and density, underscoring the importance of these different types of chronologies in reconstructions.

        "description": "\n\nSensitivity analyses are an important component of any modeling exercise. We have developed an analytical methodology based on the adjoint method to compute sensitivities of a state variable (hydraulic head) to model parameters (hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient) for transient groundwater flow in a confined and randomly heterogeneous aquifer under ambient and pumping conditions. For a special case of two-dimensional rectangular domains, these sensitivities are represented in terms of the problem configuration (the domain size, boundary configuration, medium properties, pumping schedules and rates, and observation locations and times), and there is no need to actually solve the adjoint equations. As an example, we present analyses of the obtained solution for typical groundwater flow conditions. Analytical solutions allow us to calculate sensitivities efficiently, which can be useful for model-based analyses such as parameter estimation, data-worth evaluation, and optimal experimental design related to sampling frequency and locations of observation wells. The analytical approach is not limited to groundwater applications but can be extended to any other mathematical problem with similar governing equations and under similar conceptual conditions.

        "description": "\n\nIn inverse problems, investigating uncertainty in the posterior distribution of model parameters is as important as matching data. In recent years, most efforts have focused on techniques to sample the posterior distribution with reasonable computational costs. Within a Bayesian context, this posterior depends on the prior distribution. However, most of the studies ignore modeling the prior with realistic geological uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a workflow inspired by a Popper-Bayes philosophy, that data should first be used to falsify models, then only be considered for matching. We propose a workflow consisting of three steps: (1) in defining the prior, we interpret multiple alternative geological scenarios from literature (architecture of facies) and site specific data (proportions of facies). Prior spatial uncertainty is modeled using multiple-point geostatistics, where each scenario is defined using a training image. (2) We validate these prior geological scenarios by simulating electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data on realizations of each scenario and comparing them to field ERT in a lower dimensional space. In this second step, the idea is to probabilistically falsify scenarios with ERT, meaning that scenarios which are incompatible receive an updated probability of zero while compatible scenarios receive a non-zero updated belief. (3) We constrain the hydrogeological model with hydraulic head and ERT using a stochastic search method. The workflow is applied to a synthetic and a field case studies in an alluvial aquifer. This study highlights the importance of considering and estimate prior uncertainty (without data) through a process of probabilistic falsification. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nMean sapwood thickness, measured in fifteen 73 year old Eucalyptus regnans and E. delegatensis stands, correlated strongly with forest overstorey stocking density (R2 0.72). This curvilinear relationship was used with routine forest stocking density and basal area measurements to estimate sapwood area of the forest overstorey at various times in 15 research catchments in undisturbed and disturbed forests located in the Great Dividing Range, Victoria, Australia. Up to 45 years of annual precipitation and streamflow data available from the 15 catchments was used to examine relationships between mean annual loss (evapotranspiration estimated as mean annual precipitation minus mean annual streamflow), and sapwood area. Catchment mean sapwood area correlated strongly (R2 0.88) with catchment mean annual loss. Variation in sapwood area accounted for 68% more variation in mean annual streamflow than precipitation alone (R2 0.90 compared with R2 0.22). Changes in sapwood area accounted for 96% of the changes in mean annual loss observed after forest thinning or clear-cutting and regeneration. We conclude that forest inventory data can be used reliably to predict spatial and temporal variation in catchment annual losses and streamflow in response to natural and imposed disturbances in even-aged forests. Consequently, recent advances in mapping of sapwood area using airborne light detection and ranging will enable high resolution spatial and temporal mapping of mean annual loss and mean annual streamflow over large areas of forested catchment. This will be particularly beneficial in management of water resources from forested catchments subject to disturbance but lacking reliable long-term (years to decades) streamflow records.

        "description": "\n\nA recent interpretation of climate model projections concluded that \u201cwarmer is more arid\u201d. In contrast, dust records and other evidence have led the geoscience community to conclude that \u201cwarmer is less arid\u201d leading to an aridity paradox. The \u201cwarmer is more arid\u201d interpretation is based on a projected increase in the vapour pressure deficit (\u223c 7-9% K\u22121) that results in a projected increase in potential evaporation that greatly exceeds the projected increase in precipitation. However, the increase in potential evaporation does not result in an increase in (actual) evaporation which remains more or less constant in the model output. We use that to explain why projected changes in the long-term aridity can be assessed by directly interrogating the climate model output. To that end, we equate precipitation with meteorological aridity and runoff with hydrologic aridity. A third perspective, agro-ecological aridity, is not directly related to the water lost but rather to the carbon gain and is equated with the photosynthetic uptake of CO2. We re-examine the same climate model output and conclude that \u201cwarmer is less arid\u201d from all perspectives and in agreement with the geological records. Future research will need to add the critical regional and seasonal perspectives to the aridity assessments described here. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

But connectivity cannot be easily defined in a continuous field based on information of the hydraulic conductivity alone. We conceptualize it as a connecting structure \u2013 a connected subset of a continuous hydraulic conductivity field that consists of paths of least hydraulic resistance. We develop a simple and robust numerical method to delineate the connectivity structure using information of the hydraulic conductivity field only. First, the topology of the connectivity structure is determined by finding the path(s) of least resistance between two opposite boundaries. And second, a series of connectivity structures are created by inflating and shrinking the individual channels. Finally, we apply this methodology to different heterogeneous fields. We show that our method captures the main flow channels as well as the pathways of early time solute arrivals. We find our method informative to study connectivity in 2D heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIncreased streamflow and its associated impacts on water quality have frequently been linked to changes in land use and land cover (LULC) such as tile drainage, cultivation of prairies, and increased adoption of soybeans (Glycine max) in modern day cropping systems. This study evaluated the relative importance of changes in precipitation and LULC on streamflow in 29 Hydrologic Unit Code 008 watersheds in the Upper Midwestern United States. The evaluation was done by statistically testing the changes in slope and intercept of the relationships between ln(annual streamflow) vs. annual precipitation for the periods prior to 1975 (pre-change period) and after 1976 (post-change period). A significant shift either in slope or intercept of these relationships was assumed to be an indication of LULC changes whereas a lack of significant shift suggested a single relationship driven by precipitation. All 29 watersheds showed no statistical difference in slope or intercept of the relationships between the two periods. However, a simpler model that kept the slope constant for the two periods showed a slight upward shift in the intercept value for 10 watersheds in the post-change period. A comparison of five-year moving averages also revealed that the increased streamflows in the post change period are mainly due to an increase in precipitation. Minimal or the lack of LULC change impact on streamflow results from comparable evapotranspiration in the two time periods. We also show how incorrect assumptions in previously published studies minimized precipitation change impacts and heightened the LULC change impacts on streamflows.

        "description": "\n\nThis paper presents the Decoupled Hydrological Discretisation (DHD) scheme for solving the shallow water equations in hydrological applications involving surface runoff in rural and urban basins. The name of the scheme is motivated by the fact that the three equations which form the two-dimensional shallow water system are discretised independently from each other and thus, the numerical scheme is decoupled in a mathematical sense. Its main advantages compared to other classic finite volume schemes for the shallow water equations are its simplicity to code and the lower computational cost per time step. The validation of the scheme is presented in five test cases involving overland flow and rainfall-runoff transformation over topographies of different complexity. The scheme is compared to the finite volume scheme ofRoe [1986], to the simple inertia formulation [Bates et al., 2010], and to the diffusive wave model. The test cases show that the DHD scheme is able to compute subcritical and supercritical flows in rural and urban environments, and that in overland flow applications it gives similar results to the second order scheme of Roe with a lower computational cost. The results obtained with the simple inertia and diffusive wave models are very similar to those obtained with the DHD scheme in rural basins in which the bed friction and topography dominate the flow hydrodynamics but they deteriorate in typical urban configurations in which the presence of supercritical flow conditions and small scale patterns boost the relevance of the inertial terms in the momentum equations.

The analysis on the propagation along the tributaries and deposition in the main channel provide information about sediment-water mobility, dangerous damming and potential hazard. Debris flows were generated by releasing a preset water discharge over an erodible layer of saturated gravels material. As a consequence, the debris flow sediment concentration varied accordingly to the entrainment rate which, in turn, was strongly controlled by the tributary slope. The data collected by acoustic level sensors, pore fluid pressure transducers and a load cell were used to characterize the evolution of bulk density and solid concentration of the sediment-water mixture. These two parameters were relevant to assess the stony debris flow mobility which contribute to determine the shape of sediment deposits in the main channel. The detailed bed topography surveys carried out in the main channel at the end of each experiments provided information on the morphology of these deposits and on the interplay of adjacent confluences. The influences of confluence angle, tributary slopes and triggering conditions have been investigated, for a total of 18 different configurations. Within the investigated range of parameters, the slope angle was the parameter that mainly influence the stony debris flow mobility while, for adjacent confluences, the degree of obstruction within the receiving channel was strongly influenced by the triggering scenario.

        "description": "\n\nIn steep mountain streams, macro-roughness elements typically increase both flow energy dissipation and the threshold of motion compared to lower-gradient channels, reducing the part of the flow energy available for bedload transport. Bedload transport models typically take account of these effects either by reducing the acting bed shear stress or by increasing the critical parameters for particle entrainment. Here, we evaluate bedload transport models for mixed-size sediments and models based on a median grain size using a large field dataset of fractional bedload transport rates. We derive reference shear stresses and bedload transport relations based on both the total boundary shear stress and a reduced (or \u201ceffective\u201d) shear stress that accounts for flow resistance due to macro-roughness. When reference shear stresses are derived from the total boundary shear stress they are closely related to channel slope, but when they are derived from the effective shear stress, they are almost invariant with channel slope. The performance of bedload transport models is generally comparable when using the total shear stress and a channel slope-related reference shear stress, or when using the effective shear stress and a constant reference shear stress. However, dimensionless bedload transport relations are significantly steeper for the total stress approach, whereas they are similar to the commonly used fractional Wilcock and Crowe (WC) transport model for the effective stress approach. This similarity in the relations allows the WC model, developed for lower-gradient streams, to be used in combination with an effective shear stress approach, in steep mountain streams.

There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semi-arid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined above-ground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modelling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semi-arid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg.ha\u22121) than ephemeral reedbeds (116 - 138 Mg.ha\u22121). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. 13C enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 g.m\u22122.y\u22121 and 465 g.m\u22122.y\u22121) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g.m\u22122.y\u22121). However, under current water regimes rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained.

The effect of interception can also lead to significant variations in sublimation, with estimates varying from 5 to 60% of total snowfall. Most current interception models utilize canopy closure and LAI to partition interception from snowfall and calculate interception efficiency as an exponential decrease of interception efficiency with increasing precipitation. However, as demonstrated, these models can show specific deficiencies within heterogeneous canopy. Seven field areas were equipped with 1932 surveyed points within various canopy density regimes in three elevation bands surrounding Davos, Switzerland. Snow interception measurements were taken from 2012 to 2014 (\u223c9,000 samples) and compared with measurements at two open sites. The measured data indicated the presence of snow bridging from a demonstrated increase in interception efficiency as precipitation increased until a maximum was reached. As precipitation increased beyond this maximum, the data then exhibited a decrease in interception efficiency. Standard and novel canopy parameters were developed using aerial LiDAR data. These included estimates of LAI, canopy closure, distance to canopy, gap fraction and various tree size parameters. These canopy metrics and the underlying efficiency distribution were then integrated to formulate a conceptual model based upon the snow interception measurements. This model gave a \u223c27% increase in the R2 (from 0.39 to 0.66) and a \u223c40% reduction in RMSE (from 5.19 to 3.39) for both calibration and validation data sets when compared to previous models at the point scale.

The water and land requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves but local shortages are common and have serious impacts on food security. Recent increases in global trade have mitigated some of the effects of spatial and temporal variability. However, trade has a limited impact on low-income populations who remain dependent on subsistence agriculture and local resources. Potential adverse environmental impacts of increased agricultural production include unsustainable depletion of water and soil resources, major changes in the global nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, human health problems related to excessive nutrient and pesticide use, and loss of habitats that contribute to agricultural productivity. Some typical case studies from China illustrate the connections between the need for increased food production and environmental stress. Sustainable options for decreasing food demand and for increasing production include reduction of food losses on both the producer and consumer ends, elimination of unsustainable practices such as prolonged groundwater overdraft, closing of yield gaps with controlled expansions of nutrient application and irrigation, increases in crop yield and pest resistance through advances in biotechnology, and moderate expansion of rain fed cropland. Calculations based on reasonable assumptions suggest that such measures could meet the food needs of an increasing global population while protecting the environment.

Time-lapse two-dimensional bulk conductivity and induced polarization surveys conducted during a sand tank ISCO simulation demonstrated that MnO4- plume movement could be monitored in a qualitative manner using bulk conductivity tomograms, although chargeability was below sensitivity limits. We also examined changes to in-phase and quadrature electrical conductivity resulting from ion injection, MnO2 and Cl- production, and pH change during TCE and humate oxidation by MnO4- in homogeneous aqueous solutions and saturated porous media samples. Data from the homogeneous samples demonstrated that inversion of the sand tank resistivity data using a common Tikhonov regularization approach was insufficient to recover an accurate conductivity distribution within the tank. While changes to in-phase conductivity could be successfully modeled, quadrature conductivity values could not be directly related to TCE oxidation product or MnO4- concentrations at frequencies consistent with field induced polarization surveys, limiting the utility of quadrature conductivity for monitoring ISCO.

The study period (four sampling campaigns between November 2009 and November 2011) represented the end of a decade-long drought followed by several high-flow events. The hydrometry showed that the river was generally losing to the alluvium, except when storm-derived floodwaves in the river channel generated bank recharge \u2013 discharge cycles.

        "description": "\n\nWe present a novel inverse modeling strategy to estimate spatially distributed parameters of nonlinear models. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators of these parameters are based on a likelihood functional, which contains spatially discrete measurements of the system parameters and spatio-temporally discrete measurements of the transient system states. The piecewise continuity prior for the parameters is expressed via Total Variation (TV) regularization. The MAP estimator is computed by minimizing a non-quadratic objective equipped with the TV operator. We apply this inversion algorithm to estimate hydraulic conductivity of a synthetic confined aquifer from measurements of conductivity and hydraulic head. The synthetic conductivity field is composed of a low-conductivity heterogeneous intrusion into a high-conductivity heterogeneous medium. Our algorithm accurately reconstructs the location, orientation and extent of the intrusion from the steady-state data only. Addition of transient measurements of hydraulic head improves the parameter estimation, accurately reconstructing the conductivity field in the vicinity of observation locations.

        "description": "\n\nHuman societies are increasingly altering the water and biogeochemical cycles to both improve ecosystem productivity and reduce risks associated with the unpredictable variability of climatic drivers. These alterations, however, often cause large negative environmental consequences, raising the question as to how societies can ensure a sustainable use of natural resources for the future. Here we discuss how ecohydrological modeling may address these broad questions with special attention to agroecosystems. The challenges related to modeling the two-way interaction between society and environment are illustrated by means of a dynamical model in which soil and water quality supports the growth of human society but is also degraded by excessive pressure, leading to critical transitions and sustained societal growth-collapse cycles. We then focus on the coupled dynamics of soil water and solutes (nutrients or contaminants), emphasizing the modeling challenges, presented by the strong nonlinearities in the soil and plant system and the unpredictable hydro-climatic forcing, that need to be overcome to quantitatively analyze problems of soil water sustainability in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. We discuss applications of this framework to problems of irrigation, soil salinization, and fertilization and emphasize how optimal solutions for large-scale, long-term planning of soil and water resources in agroecosystems under uncertainty could be provided by methods from stochastic control, informed by physically and mathematically sound descriptions of ecohydrological and biogeochemical interactions.

The distribution of microseismic source locations in the reservoir may reveal important information about the distribution of hydraulic and geomechanical rock properties. In this paper, we present a framework for conditioning heterogeneous rock permeability and geomechanical property distributions on microseismic data. To simulate the multi-physics processes in these systems, we combine a fully coupled flow and geomechanical model with the Mohr-Coulomb type rock failure criterion. The resulting multi-physics simulation constitutes the forecast model that relates microseismic source locations to reservoir rock properties. We adopt this forward model in an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation to jointly estimate reservoir permeability and geomechanical property distributions from injection-induced microseismic response measurements. We show that integration of a large number of spatially correlated microseismic data, with practical ensemble sizes, can lead to severe underestimation of ensemble spread, and eventually ensemble collapse. To mitigate the variance underestimation issue two low-rank data representation schemes are presented and discussed. In the first approach, microseismic data are projected onto a low-dimensional subspace defined by the left singular vectors of the perturbed observations matrix. The second method uses a coarser grid for representing the microseismic data. A series of numerical experiments is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and illustrate their applicability for assimilating microseismic data into coupled flow and geomechanical forward models to estimate multi-physics rock properties.

A two-stage model for dynamic control of the flood limited water level (the maximum allowed water level during the flood season, DC-FLWL) is established considering forecast uncertainty and acceptable flood risk. It is found that DC-FLWL is applicable when the reservoir inflow ranges from small to medium levels of the historical records, while both forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk in the downstream affect the feasible space of DC-FLWL. As forecast uncertainty increases (under a given risk level) or as acceptable risk level decreases (under a given forecast uncertainty level), the minimum required safety margin for flood control increases, and the chance for DC-FLWL decreases. The derived hedging rules from the modeling framework illustrate either the dominant role of water conservation or flood control or the tradeoff between the two objectives under different levels of forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk. These rules may provide useful guidelines for conserving water from flood, especially in the area with heavy water stress. The analysis is illustrated via a case study with a real-world reservoir in northeastern China. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Designing of reservoir operations aims primarily to fulfil the main purpose (or purposes) for which the structure has been built. However, it is well known that reservoirs strongly influence river geomorphic processes, causing sediment deficits downstream, altering water and sediment fluxes, leading to river bed incision and causing infrastructure instability and ecological degradation. We propose a framework that, by combining physically based modelling, surrogate modelling techniques and Multi-Objective (MO) optimization, allows to include fluvial geomorphology into MO optimization whose main objectives is the maximization of hydropower revenue and the minimization of river bed degradation. The case study is a run-of-the-river power plant on the River Po (Italy). A 1D mobile-bed hydro-morphological model simulated the river bed evolution over a ten year horizon for alternatives operation rules of the power plant. The knowledge provided by such a physically based model is integrated into a MO optimization routine via surrogate modelling using the response surface methodology. Hence, this framework overcomes the high computational costs that so far hindered the integration of river geomorphology into WRM. We provided numerical proof that river morphologic processes and hydropower production are indeed in conflict, but that the conflict may be mitigated with appropriate control strategies.

Whereas distributions of Y (or its logarithm) are at times slightly asymmetric with relatively mild peaks and tails, those of \u0394Y tend to be symmetric with peaks that grow sharper, and tails that become heavier, as the separation distance (lag) between pairs of Y values decreases. No statistical model known to us captures these behaviors of Y and \u0394Y in a unified and consistent manner. We propose a new, generalized sub-Gaussian model that does so. We derive analytical expressions for probability distribution functions (pdfs) of Y and \u0394Y as well as corresponding lead statistical moments. In our model the peak and tails of the \u0394Y pdf scale with lag in line with observed behavior. The model allows one to estimate, accurately and efficiently, all relevant parameters by analyzing jointly sample moments of Y and \u0394Y.

To investigate the physicochemical response of defective wellbore cement to CO2-rich brine, we carried out a reactive flow-through experiment using an artificially fractured cement sample at a length of 224.8 mm. A brine solution with dissolved CO2 at a pH of approximately 3.9 was injected through the sample at a constant rate of 0.0083 cm3/s. Surface optical profilometry analysis and 3D X-ray microtomography imaging confirmed fracture closure and self-healing behavior consistent with the measured permeability decrease. Visual inspection of the reacted fracture surface showed the development of reactive patterns mapping the flow velocity field inside the fracture, as well as restricted flow towards the sample outlet. The post-experiment permeability of the core sample was measured at half of its initial permeability. A reactive transport model was developed with parameters derived from the experiment to further examine property evolution of fractured cement under dynamic flow of CO2-rich brine. Sensitivity analysis showed that residence time and the size of initial fracture aperture are the key factors controlling the tendency to self-healing or fracture opening behavior and therefore determine the long-term integrity of the wellbore cement. Longer residence time and small apertures promote mineral precipitation, fracture closure, and therefore flow restriction. This work also suggests a narrow threshold separating the fracture opening and self-sealing behavior. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Index flood regional frequency methods pool normalized gauge data in the case of homogeneity among the constituent gauges of the region. Unitless regional quantile estimates are outputted and rescaled at each gauge. Because violation of the homogeneity hypothesis is a major component of quantile estimation error in regional frequency analysis, heterogeneity estimators should be \u201creasonable proxies\u201d of the error of quantile estimation. In this study three Monte Carlo heterogeneity statistics tested in Hosking and Wallis [1997] are plotted against Monte Carlo estimates of quantile error for all five-or-more-gauge regionalizations in a twelve-gauge network in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota. Upper-tail quantiles with non-exceedance probabilities of 0.75 and above are examined at time-steps ranging from daily to monthly. A linear relationship between heterogeneity and error estimates is found and quantified using Pearson's r score. Two of Hosking and Wallis [1997]'s heterogeneity measures, incorporating the coefficient of variation in one case and additionally the skewness in the other, are found to be reasonable proxies for quantile error at the L-moment ratio values characterizing these data. This result, in addition to confirming the utility of a commonly used coefficient of variation-based heterogeneity statistic, provides evidence for the utility of a heterogeneity measure that incorporates skewness information.

        "description": "\n\nDetection of leakage in deep geologic storage formations (e.g., carbon sequestration sites) is a challenging problem. This study investigates an easy-to-implement, frequency-domain leakage detection technology based on harmonic pulse testing (HPT). Unlike conventional constant-rate pressure interference tests, HPT stimulates a reservoir using periodic injection rates. The fundamental principle underlying HPT-based leakage detection is that leakage modifies a storage system's frequency response function, thus providing clues of system malfunction. During operations, routine HPTs can be conducted at multiple pulsing frequencies to obtain experimental frequency response functions, using which the possible time-lapse changes are examined. In this work, a set of analytical frequency response solutions is derived for predicting system responses with and without leaks for single-phase flow systems. Sensitivity studies show that HPT can effectively reveal the presence of leaks. A search procedure is then prescribed for locating the actual leaks using amplitude and phase information obtained from HPT, and the resulting optimization problem is solved using the genetic algorithm. For multiphase flows, the applicability of HPT-based leakage detection procedure is exemplified numerically using a carbon sequestration problem. Results show that the detection procedure is applicable if the average reservoir conditions in the testing zone stay relatively constant during the tests, which is a working assumption under many other interpretation methods for pressure interference tests. HPT is a cost-effective tool that only requires periodic modification of a nominal injection rate. Thus it can be incorporated into existing monitoring plans with little additional investment.

While past research on this topic offers some approaches to characterize seasonality, the methods are somewhat limited in their ability to discern the diversity of distributional types for extreme precipitation dates. Herein, we present a comprehensive approach for assessment of temporal changes in the calendar dates for extreme precipitation within a circular statistics framework which entails: a) three measures to summarize circular random variables (traditional approach), b) four nonparametric statistical tests, and c) a new nonparametric circular density method to provide a robust assessment of the nature of probability distribution and changes. Two 30-year blocks (1951-1980 and 1981-2010) of annual maximum daily precipitation from 10 stations across the state of Maine were used for our analysis. Assessment of seasonality based on nonparametric approach indicated nonstationarity; some stations exhibited shifts in significant mode towards Spring season for the recent time period while some other stations exhibited multimodal seasonal pattern for both the time periods. Nonparametric circular density method, used in this study, allows for an adaptive estimation of seasonal density. Despite the limitation of being sensitive to the smoothing parameter, this method can accurately characterize one or more modes of seasonal peaks, as well as pave the way towards assessment of changes in seasonality over time.

A large body of research published in Water Resources Research has been devoted to characterizing and understanding processes controlling the transport and fate of these organic contaminants and the effectiveness of natural attenuation, bioremediation and other remedial technologies. These contributions include studies of NAPL flow, entrapment, and interphase mass transfer that have advanced from the analysis of simple systems with uniform properties and equilibrium contaminant phase partitioning to complex systems with pore- and macro-scale heterogeneity and rate-limited interphase mass transfer. Understanding of the fate of dissolved organic plumes has advanced from when biodegradation was thought to require oxygen, to recognition of the importance of anaerobic biodegradation, multiple redox zones, microbial enzyme kinetics, and mixing of organic contaminants and electron acceptors at plume fringes. Challenges remain in understanding the impacts of physical, chemical, biological and hydrogeological heterogeneity, pore-scale interactions, and mixing on the fate of organic contaminants. Further effort is needed to successfully incorporate these processes into field-scale predictions of transport and fate. Regulations have greatly reduced the frequency of new point source contamination problems; however, remediation at many legacy plumes remains challenging. A number of fields of current relevance are benefiting from research advances from point-source contaminant research. These include geologic carbon sequestration, nonpoint source contamination, aquifer storage and recovery, the fate of contaminants from oil and gas development, and enhanced bioremediation.

Consequently, the resulting predictive uncertainty is often unreliable. Our objective is to present two approaches which use stochastic processes to describe systematic deviations and to discuss their advantages and drawbacks for urban drainage modeling. The two methodologies are an external bias description (EBD) and an internal noise description (IND, also known as stochastic grey-box modeling). They emerge from different fields and have not yet been compared in environmental modeling. To compare the two approaches we develop a unifying terminology, evaluate them theoretically, and apply them to conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling in the same drainage system. Our results show that both approaches can provide probabilistic predictions of wastewater discharge in a similarly reliable way, both for periods ranging from a few hours up to more than one week ahead of time. The EBD produces more accurate predictions on long horizons but relies on computationally heavy MCMC routines for parameter inferences. These properties make it more suitable for off-line applications. The IND can help in diagnosing the causes of output errors and is computationally inexpensive. It produces best results on short forecast horizons that are typical for on-line applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

A priori knowledge of the extent and location of each process was assumed to be known. With the exception of an equal importance of macropores and pore-filling micropores, TBPs show little sensitivity to the fraction of micropores present. In general, significant sensitivity of the TBPs was observed for uniform and throat-preferred cementation. Layering parallel to the fluid flow direction had a considerable impact on TBPs whereas layering perpendicular to flow did not. Micro-crack orientations seemed of minor importance in affecting TBPs.

This study aims at assessing to which extent these streamflow trends can be attributed to changes in air temperature or precipitation. The analysis includes a data-based approach using multiple linear regression, and a simulation-based approach using a hydrological model. The hydrological model considers changes in both glacier area and surface elevation. It was calibrated using a multiobjective optimization algorithm with calibration criteria based on glacier mass balance and daily and interannual variations of discharge. The individual contributions to the overall streamflow trends from changes in glacier geometry, temperature, and precipitation were assessed using simulation experiments with a constant glacier geometry, and with detrended temperature and precipitation time series. The results showed that the observed changes in streamflow were consistent with the changes in temperature and precipitation. In the Sari-Djaz catchment, increasing temperatures and related increase of glacier melt were identified as the dominant driver, while in the Kakshaal catchment, both increasing temperatures and increasing precipitation played a major role. Comparing the two approaches, an advantage of the simulation-based approach is the fact that it is based on process-based relationships implemented in the hydrological model instead of statistical links in the regression model. However, data-based approaches are less affected by model parameter and structural uncertainties and typically fast to apply. A complementary application of both approaches is recommended.

Based on this, we analyze the increased willingness to adopt water conservation strategies if energy cost is included in the customers' utility function. Using a Water-Energy-CO2 emissions model for household water end uses and probability distribution functions for parameters affecting water and water-related energy use in 10 different locations in California, this research introduces a probabilistic two-stage optimization model considering technical and behavioral decision variables to obtain the most economical strategies to minimize household water and water-related energy bills and costs given both water and energy price shocks. Results can likely to be an upper bound of household savings for customers with well-behaved preferences, and show greater adoption rates to reduce energy intensive appliances when energy is accounted, resulting in an overall 24% reduction in indoor water use that represents a 30 percent reduction in water-related energy use and a 53 percent reduction in household water-related CO2 emissions. Previous use patterns and water and energy rate structures can affect greatly the potential benefits for customers and so their behavior.\nGiven that water and energy are somewhat complementary goods for customers, we use results of the optimization to obtain own-price and cross-price elasticities of residential water use by simulating increases in water and energy prices.

The assumptions underpinning standard tools in hydraulics are commonly violated and alternative approaches must be formulated. I argue that we should question the assumption that classical notions in fluid mechanics provide the foundations for the techniques of the future. Recent work on turbulent dissipation, interscale modulation of the dynamics, intermittency and the role of complex forcings is discussed. An agenda for future work is proposed that involves improving our characterization of complex forcings and developing better understanding of the behavior of the velocity gradient tensor in complex, fluvial environments. This leads to the formulation of modeling tools relevant to fluvial fluid mechanics, rather than a reliance on methods developed elsewhere. One avenue by which such methods might be developed is suggested based on the stretched spiral vortex as a baseline topology. This would result in a non-equilibrium model for turbulence that has greater potential to capture the dynamics in which we are interested. Although these ideas are raised in the context of a future fluvial fluid mechanics, they are applicable to any situation where turbulent flows are forced in complicated ways.

Results indicate that high quality solutions can be obtained within a reasonable number of function evaluations and demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the approach through two case studies.

        "description": "\n\nMethane and brine leakage rates and associated time scales along the cemented casing of a hypothetical decommissioned shale-gas well have been assessed with a multi-phase flow and multi-component numerical model. The conceptual model used for the simulations assumes that the target shale formation is 200 m thick, overlain by a 750 m thick caprock, which is in turn overlain by a 50 m thick surficial sand aquifer, the 1000 m geological sequence being intersected by a fully-penetrating borehole. This succession of geological units is representative of the region targeted for shale gas exploration in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). The simulations aimed at assessing the impact of well casing cementation quality on methane and brine leakage at the base of a surficial aquifer. The leakage of fluids can subsequently lead to the contamination of groundwater resources and/or, in the case of methane migration to ground surface, to an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions. The minimum reported surface casing vent flow (measured at ground level) for shale gas wells in Quebec (0.01 m3/day) is used as a reference to evaluate the impact of well casing cementation quality on methane and brine migration. The simulations suggest that an adequately cemented borehole (with a casing annulus permeability kc \u2264 1 mD) can prevent methane and brine leakage over a time scale of up to 100 years. However, a poorly cemented borehole (kc \u2265 10 mD) could yield methane leakage rates at the base of an aquifer ranging from 0.04 m\u00b3/day to more than 100 m\u00b3/day, depending on the permeability of the target shale gas formation after abandonment and on the quantity of mobile gas in the formation. These values are compatible with surface casing vent flows reported for shale gas wells in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec, Canada). The simulated travel time of methane from the target shale formation to the surficial aquifer is between a few months and 30 years, depending on cementation quality and hydrodynamic properties of the casing annulus. Simulated long-term brine leakage rates after 100 years for poorly cemented boreholes are on the order of 10\u22125 m3/day (10 ml/day) to 10\u22123 m3/day (1 l/day). Based on scoping calculations with a well-mixed aquifer model, these rates are unlikely to have a major impact on groundwater quality in a confined aquifer since they would only increase the chloride concentration by 1 mg/l, which is significantly below the commonly recommended aesthetic objective of 250 mg/l for chloride.

Experimental data were collected using three fish ladder reaches with slopes between 2.6 and 10%. Four types of field measurements were conducted: topographical surveys to extract the thalweg profiles and cross-sectional geometry of reference cross sections; grain size analyses of the bed surface; steady state runs with a given flow rate (0.005-0.234 m3/s), and surveying of the water profile in the most significant cross sections. The following main conclusions were reached: i) The dominance of spill resistance at the lowest discharge (pool water depth-step height ratios of 0.4) causes primary dimensionless head losses of up to 80%, and these losses progressively decrease to approximately 40% when the water discharge and related pool water depth submerge the upstream step height. A specific predictive equation for the head loss was calibrated and verified via data from the Rio Cordon. ii) The verification of literature-sourced equations to predict the reach-averaged flow velocity provided suitable results for several of these equations indicating that the use of a specific step-pool equation does not appear to be crucial to achieving accurate predictions.

Here an extensive laboratory study was undertaken to assess whether the dispersivity, which traditionally has been considered to be a property of the porous medium, is dependent on colloid particle size and interstitial velocity. A total of 48 colloid transport experiments were performed in columns packed with glass beads under chemically unfavorable colloid attachment conditions. Nine different colloid diameters, and various flow velocities were examined. The breakthrough curves were successfully simulated with a mathematical model describing colloid transport in homogeneous, water saturated porous media. The experimental data set collected in this study demonstrated that the dispersivity is positively correlated with colloid particle size, and increases with increasing velocity. The dispersivity values determined in this laboratory study were compared with 380 dispersivity values from earlier laboratory- and field-scale solute, colloid and biocolloid transport studies published in the literature.

During the experiments, bubbles, released from a diffuser, moved upward through a quasi-2D flume filled with transparent water-based gelbeads and formed a distinct plume that could be well registered by a calibrated camera. Outflowing bubbles were collected on the top of the flume using volumetric burettes for flux measurements. We quantified the scaling behaviors between the gas (bubble) release rates and various characteristic parameters of the bubble plume, including plume tip velocity, plume width and breakthrough time of the plume front. The experiments also revealed circulations of ambient pore water induced by the bubble flow. Based on a simple momentum exchange model, we showed that the relationship between the mean pore water velocity and gas release rate is consistent with the scaling solution for the bubble plume. These findings have important implications for studies of natural gas emission and air sparging, as well as fundamental research on bubble transport in porous media.

The methodology relies on a latent Gaussian field that drives both the occurrence and intensity of the precipitation process. For the precipitation intensity the marginal distributions, which are space and time dependent, are described by a composite model of a gamma-distribution for observations below some threshold with a generalized Pareto distribution modeling the excesses above the threshold. Model parameters are estimated from data and extrapolated to locations and times with no direct observations using linear regression of position covariates. One advantage of such a model is that stochastic generator parameters are readily available at any location and time of the year inside the stationarity regions. The methodology is illustrated for a network of 12 locations in Sweden. Performance of the model is judged through its ability to accurately reproduce a series of spatial dependence measures and weather indices. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nExperimental design and data collection constitute two main steps of the iterative research cycle (aka the scientific method). To help evaluate competing hypotheses, it is critical to ensure that the experimental design is appropriate and maximizes information retrieval from the system of interest. Scientific hypothesis testing is implemented by comparing plausible model structures (conceptual discrimination) and sets of predictions (predictive discrimination). This research presents a new Discrimination-Inference (DI) methodology to identify prospective datasets highly suitable for either conceptual or predictive discrimination. The DI methodology uses preposterior estimation techniques to evaluate the expected change in the conceptual or predictive probabilities, as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We present two case studies with increasing complexity to illustrate implementation of the DI for maximizing information withdrawal from a system of interest. The case studies show that highly informative datasets for conceptual discrimination are in general those for which between-model (conceptual) uncertainty is large relative to the within-model (parameter) uncertainty, and the redundancy between individual measurements in the set is minimized. The optimal dataset differs if predictive, rather than conceptual, discrimination is the experimental design objective. Our results show that DI analyses highlight measurements that can be used to address critical uncertainties related to the prediction of interest. Finally, we find that the optimal dataset for predictive discrimination is sensitive to the predictive grouping definition in ways that are not immediately apparent from inspection of the model structure and parameter values.

Although several studies have addressed macro-scale response, only a few have focused on quantifying smaller-scale basin re-organization. To that goal, a series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted where a self-organized complete drainage network emerged under constant precipitation and uplift dynamics. Once steady state was achieved, the landscape was subjected to a five-fold increase in precipitation (transient state). Throughout the evolution, high resolution spatio-temporal topographic data in the form of digital elevation models were collected. The steady state landscape was shown to possess three distinct geomorphic regimes (unchannelized hillslopes, debris-dominated channels, and fluvially-dominated channels). During transient state, landscape re-organization was observed to be driven by hillslopes via accelerated erosion, ridge lowering, channel widening, and reduction of basin relief as opposed to channel base-level reduction. Quantitative metrics on which these conclusions were based included slope-area curve, correlation analysis of spatial and temporal elevation increments, and wavelet spectral analysis of the evolving landscapes. Our results highlight that landscape re-organization in response to increased precipitation seems to follow \u201can arrow of scale\u201d: major elevation change initiates at the hillslope scale driving erosional regime change at intermediate scales and further cascading to geomorphic changes at the channel scale as time evolves.

A point process characterization of threshold exceedances is used, which allows for direct inclusion of covariates in the model; as well as a non-stationary model for block maxima series. In particular, changes in annual, winter and summer block maxima and peaks over threshold extracted from gauged instantaneous flows records in two hydrologically similar catchments located in close proximity to one another in northern England are investigated. The study catchment is characterized by large increases in urbanization levels in recent decades, while the paired control catchment has remained undeveloped during the study period (1970-2010). To avoid the potential confounding effect of natural variability, a covariate which summarize key climatological properties is included in the flood frequency model. A significant effect of the increasing urbanization levels on high flows is detected, in particular in the summer season. Point process models appear to be superior to block maxima models in their ability to detect the effect of the increase in urbanization levels on high flows. This article is protected by copyright.

The spatial and temporal pattern of landscape behavior is characterized by \u223cf\u22121 scaling in sediment discharge and power law scaling in the magnitude and frequency of ridge movement in all four experiments. We find that internally generated SOC (self-organized critical) processes generate dynamically stable catchment geometries after \u223c1 relief depths of erosion: these regularly spaced catchments have an average outlet spacing ratio of 2.16, well within the range of values reported in field studies. Once formed, large catchment bounding ridges oscillate about a critically balanced mean location, with occasional large scale changes in catchment size. Ridge movement appears to be driven by the competition for discharge as landslides push ridges back and forth. These dynamics lead to the emergence of a complex two-fold scaling in catchment dynamics that is fully established by 1.8 relief depths of erosion; at this stage a clear threshold has emerged separating two distinct scaling regimes, where large ridge mobility is insensitive to relief and small ridge mobility is relief dependent. Overall, we demonstrate that the development of dynamically-stable large scale landforms is related to the emergence of a complex-system hierarchy in topographic dynamics. Once formed these landscapes do not evolve; statistical properties such as average topography and discharge become stationary whilst topography remains highly dynamic at smaller length-scales.

In the U.S., these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly cities in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic, economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes, and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary, mixed-methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.

However, characterization of hillslope-scale soil moisture is challenging since it is both spatially heterogeneous and dynamic. This paper introduces an entropy-based and discretization-invariant dimensionless index of hydrologic complexity H that measures the distance of a given distribution of soil moisture from a Dirac delta (most organization) and a uniform distribution (widest distribution). Applying the distributed hydrologic model MOBIDIC to seven test basins with areas ranging 10\u00b0 \u2013 103 km2 and representing semiarid and temperate climates, H is shown to capture distributional characteristics of soil moisture fields. It can also track the temporal evolution of the distributional features. Furthermore, this paper explores how basin attributes affect the characteristic H, and how H can be used to explain inter-basin variability in hydrologic response. Relationships are found only by grouping basins with the same climate or size. For the semiarid basins, H scales with catchment area, topographic wetness, infiltration ratio and baseflow index; while H is inversely related to relief ratio.

Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate how density gradients associated with salinity variations affect pore-water flow in the salt marsh system. The results showed that upward salinity (density) gradients could lead to flow instability and the formation of salt fingers. These fingers, varying in size with the distance from the creek, modified significantly the pore-water flow field, especially in the marsh interior. While the flow instability enhanced local salt transport and mixing considerably, the net effect was small, causing only a slight increase in the overall mass exchange across the marsh surface. In contrast, downward salinity gradients exerted less influence on the pore-water flow in the marsh soil and slightly weakened the surface water and groundwater exchange across the marsh surface. Numerical simulations revealed similar density effects on pore-water flow at the field scale under realistic conditions. These findings have important implications for studies of marsh soil conditions concerning plant growth as well as nutrient exchange between the marsh and coastal marine system.

Topographically induced lateral water redistribution and water removal through evapotranspiration lead to spatially and temporally variable patterns of watershed water storage. These dynamic storage patterns combined with threshold mediation of saturated subsurface throughflow lead to runoff source areas that are dynamic through time. To investigate these processes and their manifestation in watershed runoff, we developed and applied a parsimonious but spatially distributed model (WECOH - Watershed ECOHydrology). Evapotranspiration was measured via an eddy-covariance tower located within the catchment and disaggregated as a function of vegetation structure. This modeling approach reproduced the stream hydrograph well and was internally consistent with observed watershed runoff patterns and behavior. We further examined the spatial patterns of water storage and their evolution through time by building on past research focused on landscape hydrologic connectivity. The percentage of landscape area connected to the stream network ranged from less than 1% during the fall and winter baseflow period to 71% during snowmelt. Over the course of the two-year study period 90% of the watershed areas were connected to the stream network for at least one day, leaving 10% of area that never became connected. Runoff source areas during the event shifted from riparian dominated runoff to areas at greater distances from the stream network when hillslopes became connected. Our modeling approach elucidates and enables quantification and prediction of watershed active areas and those active areas connected to the stream network through time.

The largest flood peaks in the Fernow are an order of magnitude smaller than record floods in the central Appalachian region (for basins of comparable drainage area). We examine flood distributions in the Fernow using extreme value distributions (Generalized Extreme Value and Generalized Pareto distributions) and compare them to other watersheds in the central Appalachians. To examine the role of antecedent soil moisture on flood response, we installed a network of 415 crest-stage piezometers on two headwater watersheds (0.30 and 0.14 km2) of the Fernow. Observations show pronounced heterogeneity of subsurface saturation even within the unchannelized swales of headwater watersheds. Shallow perched water tables over large portions of a watershed occur infrequently in forested central Appalachian basins, but may play an important role in extreme flood response. Fernow watersheds include \u201ctreated\u201d and control watersheds with stream gaging records extending back to 1951.

Our solution is a set of three ordinary differential equation (ODEs) derived from unsaturated flux and mass conservation principles. We used a hodograph transformation, the Method of Lines, and a finite water-content discretization to produce ODEs that accurately simulate infiltration, falling slugs, and groundwater table dynamic effects on vadose zone fluxes. This formulation, which we refer to as \"finite water-content\" simulates sharp fronts, and is guaranteed to conserve mass using a finite-volume solution. Our ODE solution method is explicitly integrable, does not require iterations and therefore has no convergence limits and is computationally efficient. The method accepts boundary fluxes including arbitrary precipitation, bare soil evaporation and evapotranspiration. The method can simulate heterogeneous soils using layers. Results are presented in terms of fluxes and water content profiles. Comparing our method against analytical solutions, laboratory data, and the Hydrus-1D solver, we find that predictive performance of our finite water-content ODE method is comparable to or in some cases exceeds that of the solution of Richards' equation, with or without a shallow water table. The presented ODE method is transformative in that it offers accuracy comparable to the Richards [1931] PDE numerical solution, without the numerical complexity, in a form that is robust, continuous, and suitable for use in large watershed and land-atmosphere simulation models, including regional-scale models of coupled climate and hydrology.

Hydrologic systems change in response to a variety of natural and human forces such as climate variability and change, water use and water infrastructure and land cover change. In turn, changes in hydrologic systems impact socio-economic, ecological and climate systems at a number of scales, leading to a co-evolution of these interlinked systems. The Harvard Water Program, Hydro-sociology, Integrated Water Resources Management, Eco-Hydrology, Hydromorphology and Socio-Hydrology were all introduced to provide different, interdisciplinary perspectives on water problems to address the dynamics of human interaction with the hydrosphere and the evolution Earth's hydrologic systems during the Anthropocene epoch. Each of them addresses scientific, social and engineering challenges related to how humans influence water systems and vice versa. There are now numerous examples in the literature of how holistic approaches can provide a structure and vision of the future of hydrology. We review selected examples, which taken together, describe the type of theoretical and applied integrated hydrologic analyses and associated curricular content required to address the societal issue of water-resources sustainability. We describe a modern interdisciplinary science of hydrology needed to develop an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of the connectedness between human and natural systems and to determine effective solutions to resolve the complex water problems that the world faces today.

        "description": "\n\nGeophysics provides a multidimensional suite of investigative methods that are transforming our ability to see into the very fabric of the subsurface environment, and monitor the dynamics of its fluids and the biogeochemical reactions that occur within it. Here we document how geophysical methods have emerged as valuable tools for investigating shallow subsurface processes over the past two decades and offer a vision for future developments relevant to hydrology and also ecosystem science. The field of \u201chydrogeophysics\u201d arose in the late 1990s, prompted, in part, by the wealth of studies on stochastic subsurface hydrology that argued for better field-based investigative techniques. These new hydrogeophysical approaches benefited from the emergence of practical and robust data inversion techniques, in many cases with a view to quantify shallow subsurface heterogeneity and the associated dynamics of subsurface fluids. Furthermore, the need for quantitative characterization stimulated a wealth of new investigations into petrophysical relationships that link hydrologically relevant properties to measurable geophysical parameters. Development of time-lapse approaches provided a new suite of tools for hydrological investigation, enhanced further with the realization that some geophysical properties may be sensitive to biogeochemical transformations in the subsurface environment, thus opening up the new field of \u201cbiogeophysics.\u201d Early hydrogeophysical studies often concentrated on relatively small \u201cplot-scale\u201d experiments. More recently, however, the translation to larger-scale characterization has been the focus of a number of studies. Geophysical technologies continue to develop, driven, in part, by the increasing need to understand and quantify key processes controlling sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWe present a Bayesian inversion method for the joint inference of high-dimensional multi-Gaussian hydraulic conductivity fields and associated geostatistical parameters from indirect hydrological data. We combine Gaussian process generation via circulant embedding to decouple the variogram from grid cell specific values, with dimensionality reduction by interpolation to enable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Using the Mat\u00e9rn variogram model, this formulation allows inferring the conductivity values simultaneously with the field smoothness (also called Mat\u00e9rn shape parameter) and other geostatistical parameters such as the mean, sill, integral scales and anisotropy direction(s) and ratio(s). The proposed dimensionality reduction method systematically honors the underlying variogram and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion. We illustrate our inversion approach using synthetic (error corrupted) data from a tracer experiment in a fairly heterogeneous 10,000-dimensional 2-D conductivity field. A 40-times reduction of the size of the parameter space did not prevent the posterior simulations to appropriately fit the measurement data and the posterior parameter distributions to include the true geostatistical parameter values. Overall, the posterior field realizations covered a wide range of geostatistical models, questioning the common practice of assuming a fixed variogram prior to inference of the hydraulic conductivity values. Our method is shown to be more efficient than sequential Gibbs sampling (SGS) for the considered case study, particularly when implemented on a distributed computing cluster. It is also found to outperform the method of anchored distributions (MAD) for the same computational budget.\n",

        "description": "\n\nTime variant catchment transit time distributions are fundamental descriptors of catchment function but yet not fully understood, characterized, and modeled. Here we present a new approach for use with standard runoff and tracer data sets that is based on tracking of tracer and age information and time variant catchment mixing. Our new approach is able to deal with nonstationarity of flow paths and catchment mixing, and an irregular shape of the transit time distribution. The approach extracts information on catchment mixing from the stable isotope time series instead of prior assumptions of mixing or the shape of transit time distribution. We first demonstrate proof of concept of the approach with artificial data; the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies in tracer and instantaneous transit times were >0.9. The model provides very accurate estimates of time variant transit times when the boundary conditions and fluxes are fully known. We then tested the model with real rainfall-runoff flow and isotope tracer time series from the H.J. Andrews Watershed 10 (WS10) in Oregon. Model efficiencies were 0.37 for the 18O modeling for a 2 year time series; the efficiencies increased to 0.86 for the second year underlying the need of long time tracer time series with a long overlap of tracer input and output. The approach was able to determine time variant transit time of WS10 with field data and showed how it follows the storage dynamics and related changes in flow paths where wet periods with high flows resulted in clearly shorter transit times compared to dry low flow periods.\n",

Most of these studies have focused on beach settings, where the combined variations in fresh and saline SGD can be difficult to interpret. We calculated variations in saline SGD based on a 1 year record of hydraulic head in a salt marsh, where we could isolate variations in saline, tidally driven SGD. Observed SGD varied by an order of magnitude over the course of the year. Groundwater discharge was proportional to tidal amplitude and varied by at least a factor of 2 between spring and neap tides. Monthly average SGD was inversely proportional to average sea level; it increased by nearly a factor of 2 as sea level declined by \u223c50 cm from late summer to late winter. This variation was far larger than that predicted by analytic models, owing to the flat topography and inundation of the marsh platform. The effect of short-term (days) variations in sea level associated with wind events and storms was small in comparison. SGD is probably proportional to tidal amplitude in nearly all coastal settings, including beaches. Seasonal variations in sea level may not affect the volume of SGD as significantly in coastal settings where the slope of the intertidal zone is relatively constant, but such variations have the potential to strongly affect the composition of SGD.\n",

The stream is considered as an irregular boundary represented by discrete nodes. Image wells are arranged along the stream and near those nodes. On the basis of the Theis (1935) solution and the principle of superposition, the solution for the aquifer drawdown subject to the stream can then be expressed as the sum of the Theis solution and a simple series representing the effect of those image wells. The discharge rates of the image wells are determined by solving a system of equations obtained by substituting the drawdown solution into the Robin condition. Quantitative criteria for assessing the applicability of the image well theory are provided. On the basis of the drawdown solution and Darcy's law, the analytical solution for SDR can then be obtained. A finite element solution is also developed to verify the SDR solution. Temporal SDR distributions predicted by both the analytical solution and finite element solution agree well over the entire period except at late time when the stream filtration rate approaches the pumping rate (i.e., SDR \u2245 1). It is found that a meandering stream has a significant effect on SDR compared with a rectilinear one and the effect should be taken into account in estimating SDR.\n",

        "description": "\n\nAnaerobic biodegradation of organic amendments and contaminants in aquifers can trigger secondary water quality impacts that impair groundwater resources. Reactive transport models help elucidate how diverse geochemical reactions control the spatiotemporal evolution of these impacts. Using extensive monitoring data from a crude oil spill site near Bemidji, Minnesota (USA), we implemented a comprehensive model that simulates secondary plumes of depleted dissolved O2 and elevated concentrations of Mn2+, Fe2+, CH4, and Ca2+ over a two-dimensional cross section for 30 years following the spill. The model produces observed changes by representing multiple oil constituents and coupled carbonate and hydroxide chemistry. The model includes reactions with carbonates and Fe and Mn mineral phases, outgassing of CH4 and CO2 gas phases, and sorption of Fe, Mn, and H+. Model results demonstrate that most of the carbon loss from the oil (70%) occurs through direct outgassing from the oil source zone, greatly limiting the amount of CH4 cycled down-gradient. The vast majority of reduced Fe is strongly attenuated on sediments, with most (91%) in the sorbed form in the model. Ferrous carbonates constitute a small fraction of the reduced Fe in simulations, but may be important for furthering the reduction of ferric oxides. The combined effect of concomitant redox reactions, sorption, and dissolved CO2 inputs from source-zone degradation successfully reproduced observed pH. The model demonstrates that secondary water quality impacts may depend strongly on organic carbon properties, and impacts may decrease due to sorption and direct outgassing from the source zone.\n",

Despite their importance, quantitative frameworks for their analysis lack behind those available for tributary networks. In a companion paper, delta channel networks were conceptualized as directed graphs and spectral graph theory was used to design a quantitative framework for exploring delta connectivity and flux dynamics. Here we use this framework to introduce a suite of graph-theoretic and entropy-based metrics, to quantify two components of a delta's complexity: (1) Topologic, imposed by the network connectivity and (2) Dynamic, dictated by the flux partitioning and distribution. The metrics are aimed to facilitate comparing, contrasting, and establishing connections between deltaic structure, process, and form. We illustrate the proposed analysis using seven deltas in diverse morphodynamic environments and of various degrees of channel complexity. By projecting deltas into a topo-dynamic space whose coordinates are given by topologic and dynamic delta complexity metrics, we show that this space provides a basis for delta comparison and physical insight into their dynamic behavior. The examined metrics are demonstrated to relate to the intuitive notion of vulnerability, measured by the impact of upstream flux changes to the shoreline flux, and reveal that complexity and vulnerability are inversely related. Finally, a spatially explicit metric, akin to a delta width function, is introduced to classify shapes of different delta types.\n",

The natural balance of material and energy fluxes, which maintains a stable hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often disrupted by external perturbations causing topological and dynamical changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative framework for studying delta channel network connectivity and transport dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in computing delta's steady state fluxes and identifying upstream (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas and fluxes from any point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream links. The framework is applied to the Wax Lake delta in the Louisiana coast of the U.S. and the Niger delta in West Africa. In a companion paper, we present a comprehensive suite of metrics that quantify topologic and dynamic complexity of delta channel networks and, via application to seven deltas in diverse environments, demonstrate their potential to reveal delta morphodynamics and relate to notions of vulnerability and robustness.\n",

The successive linear estimator (SLE) developed by Mao et al. (2013c) for interpreting HT in unconfined aquifers is utilized to obtain tomograms of hydraulic conductivity (K), specific storage (Ss), and the unsaturated zone parameters (pore size parameter (\u03b1) and saturated water content (\u03b8s)) for the Gardner-Russo's model. The estimated tomograms are first evaluated by visually comparing them with stratigraphy visible in the sandbox. Results reveal that the HT analysis is able to accurately capture the location and extent of heterogeneity including high and low K layers within the saturated and unsaturated zones, as well as reasonable distribution patterns of \u03b1 and \u03b8s for the Gardner-Russo's model. We then validate the estimated tomograms through predictions of drawdown responses of pumping tests not used during the inverse modeling effort. The strong agreement between simulated and observed drawdown curves obtained by pressure transducers and tensiometers demonstrates the robust performance of HT that considers variably saturated flow processes in unconfined aquifers and the unsaturated zone above it. In addition, compared to the case using the homogeneous assumption, HT results, as expected, yield significantly better predictions of drawdowns in both the saturated and unsaturated zones. This comparison further substantiates the unbiased and minimal variance of HT analysis with the SLE algorithm.\n",

These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed.

The former, \u201cadaptation effect\u201d, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, \u201clevee effect\u201d, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two main prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.\n",

Di Baldassarre et al. implement socio-hydrology as a flood risk problem using the concept of social memory as a vehicle to link human perceptions to flood damage. Their mathematical model has heuristic value in comparing potential flood damages in green versus technological societies. It can also support communities in exploring the potential consequences of policy decisions and evaluating critical policy tradeoffs, for example, between flood protection and economic development. The concept of social memory does not, however, adequately capture the social processes whereby public perceptions are translated into policy action, including the pivotal role played by the media in intensifying or attenuating perceived flood risk, the success of policy entrepreneurs in keeping flood hazard on the public agenda during short windows of opportunity for policy action, and different societal approaches to managing flood risk that derive from cultural values and economic interests. We endorse the value of seeking to capture these dynamics in a simplified conceptual framework, but favor a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology that includes a knowledge exchange component, including the way modeling insights and scientific results are communicated to floodplain managers. The social processes used to disseminate the products of socio-hydrological research are as important as the research results themselves in determining whether modeling is used for real-world decision making.\n",

A new numerical model termed ISOtope-based FLuvial Organic Carbon (ISOFLOC) is formulated to simulate the fluvial organic carbon budget in watersheds where hydrologic, sediment transport, and biogeochemical processes are coupled to control benthic and transported carbon composition and flux. One ISOFLOC innovation is the formulation of new stable carbon isotope model subroutines that include isotope fractionation processes in order to estimate carbon isotope source, fate, and transport. A second innovation is the coupling of transfers between carbon pools, including algal particulate organic carbon, fine particulate and dissolved organic carbon, and particulate and dissolved inorganic carbon, to simulate the carbon cycle in a comprehensive manner beyond that of existing watershed water quality models. ISOFLOC was tested and verified in a low-gradient, agriculturally impacted stream. Results of a global sensitivity analysis suggested the isotope response variable had unique sensitivity to the coupled interaction between fluvial shear resistance of algal biomass and the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon. Model calibration and validation suggested good agreement at event, seasonal, and annual timescales. Multiobjective uncertainty analysis suggested inclusion of the carbon stable isotope routine reduced uncertainty by 80% for algal particulate organic carbon flux estimates.\n",

        "description": "\n\nUngauged headwater basins are an abundant part of the river network, but dominant influences on headwater hydrologic response remain difficult to predict. To address this gap, we investigated the ability of a physically based watershed model (the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model) to represent controls on metrics of hydrologic partitioning across five adjacent headwater subcatchments. The five study subcatchments, located in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana, have similar climate but variable topography and vegetation distribution. This facilitated a comparative hydrology approach to interpret how parameters that influence partitioning, detected via global sensitivity analysis, differ across catchments. Model parameters were constrained a priori using existing regional information and expert knowledge. Influential parameters were compared to perceptions of catchment functioning and its variability across subcatchments. Despite between-catchment differences in topography and vegetation, hydrologic partitioning across all metrics and all subcatchments was sensitive to a similar subset of snow, vegetation, and soil parameters. Results also highlighted one subcatchment with low certainty in parameter sensitivity, indicating that the model poorly represented some complexities in this subcatchment likely because an important process is missing or poorly characterized in the mechanistic model. For use in other basins, this method can assess parameter sensitivities as a function of the specific ungauged system to which it is applied. Overall, this approach can be employed to identify dominant modeled controls on catchment response and their agreement with system understanding.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe increasing presence of toxic chemicals released in the subsurface has led to a rapid growth of social concerns and the need to develop and employ models that can predict the impact of groundwater contamination on human health risk under uncertainty. Monitored natural attenuation is a common remediation action in many contamination cases. However, natural attenuation can lead to the production of daughter species of distinct toxicity that may pose challenges in pollution management strategies. The actual threat that these contaminants pose to human health depends on the interplay between the complex structure of the geological media and the toxicity of each pollutant byproduct. This work addresses human health risk for chemical mixtures resulting from the sequential degradation of a contaminant (such as a chlorinated solvent) under uncertainty through high-resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations. We systematically investigate the interaction between aquifer heterogeneity, flow connectivity, contaminant injection model, and chemical toxicity in the probabilistic characterization of health risk. We illustrate how chemical-specific travel times control the regime of the expected risk and its corresponding uncertainties. Results indicate conditions where preferential flow paths can favor the reduction of the overall risk of the chemical mixture. The overall human risk response to aquifer connectivity is shown to be nontrivial for multispecies transport. This nontriviality is a result of the interaction between aquifer heterogeneity and chemical toxicity. To quantify the joint effect of connectivity and toxicity in health risk, we propose a toxicity-based Damk\u00f6hler number. Furthermore, we provide a statistical characterization in terms of low-order moments and the probability density function of the individual and total risks.\n",

The major environmental consequence of groundwater pumping is anthropogenic land subsidence. The first observation concerning land settlement linked to subsurface processes was made in 1926 by the American geologists Pratt and Johnson, who wrote that \u201cthe cause of subsidence is to be found in the extensive extraction of fluid from beneath the affected area.\u201d Since then, impressive progress has been made in terms of: (a) recognizing the basic hydrologic and geomechanic principles underlying the occurrence; (b) measuring aquifer compaction and ground displacements, both vertical and horizontal; (c) modeling and predicting the past and future event; and (d) mitigating environmental impact through aquifer recharge and/or surface water injection. The first milestone in the theory of pumped aquifer consolidation was reached in 1923 by Terzaghi, who introduced the principle of \u201ceffective intergranular stress.\u201d In the early 1970s, the emerging computer technology facilitated development of the first mathematical model of the subsidence of Venice, made by Gambolati and Freeze. Since then, the comprehension, measuring, and simulation of the occurrence have improved dramatically. More challenging today are the issues of ground ruptures and induced/triggered seismicity, which call for a shift from the classical continuum approach to discontinuous mechanics. Although well known for decades, anthropogenic land subsidence is still threatening large urban centers and deltaic areas worldwide, such as Bangkok, Jakarta, and Mexico City, at rates in the order of 10 cm/yr.\n",

To date, only two studies have been conducted using empirical data, both using data from the 21 km2 Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed that is located in Mississippi, in an effort to uncover the physical processes that control the event-to-event variability of the flood scaling parameters. Our study expands the analysis to the mesoscale Iowa River basin (A\u2009=\u200932,400 km2), which is located in eastern Iowa, and provides additional insights into the physical processes that control the flood scaling parameters. Using 51 rainfall-runoff events that we identified over the 12 year period since 2002, we show how the duration and depth of excess rainfall, which is the portion of rainfall that contributes to direct runoff, control the flood scaling exponent and intercept. Moreover, using a diagnostic simulation study that is guided by evidence found in empirical data, we show that the temporal structure of excess rainfall has a significant effect on the scaling structure of peak discharges. These insights will contribute toward ongoing efforts to provide a framework for flood prediction in ungauged basins.\n",

Opportunities for new and innovative research into these areas are being facilitated by advances in the use of cyberinfrastructure, such as the development of digital catchment observatories. This is enabling research into hydrological issues such as flooding to be approached differently. The ability to combine different sources of data, knowledge, and modeling capabilities from different groups such as scientists, policy makers, and the general public has the potential to provide novel insights into the way individual catchments respond at different temporal and spatial scales. While the potential benefits of the digital catchment observatory are large, this new way of carrying out research into hydrological sciences is likely to prove challenging on many levels. Along with the obvious technical and infrastructural challenges to this work, an important area for consideration is how to enable a digital observatory to work for a range of potential end-users, paving the way for new areas of research through developing a platform effective for engagement and knowledge exchange. Using examples from the recent local-scale hydrological exemplar in the Environmental Virtual Observatory pilot project (http://www.evo-uk.org), this commentary considers a number of issues around the communication between and engagement of different users, the use of local knowledge and uncertainty with cloud-based models, and the potential for decision support and directions for future research.\n",

While many forested headwater catchments exhibit winter and early spring peaks in \nNO3\u2212 concentrations, several watersheds have peak concentrations during the summer months. Pond Branch, a headwater catchment in Maryland monitored for over 10 years, exhibits recurrent and broad summer peaks in both \nNO3\u2212 concentrations and watershed export. Higher \nNO3\u2212 export from June to September is particularly surprising, given that these summer months typically have the year's lowest discharge. A key challenge is identifying the source(s) of \nNO3\u2212 and the mechanism(s) by which it is transported to the watershed outlet during the summer. In this study, we assessed multiple hypotheses (not mutually exclusive) that could account for the seasonal trend including proximal controls of groundwater-surface water interactions, instream processes, and riparian groundwater-N cycling interactions, as well as two distal controls: geochemical weathering and senescence of riparian vegetation. A combination of long-term weekly and limited duration high-frequency sensor data reveals the importance of riparian ecohydrologic processes during base flow. In this watershed, patterns of seasonal stream water \nNO3\u2212 concentrations and fluxes depend fundamentally on interactions between groundwater dynamics and nitrogen (N) cycling in the riparian zone. Groundwater tables control nitrification-denitrification dynamics as well as hydrologic transport. Our results suggest that in many watersheds, a more sophisticated exploration of \nNO3\u2212 production and \nNO3\u2212 transport mechanisms is required to identify critical points in the landscape and over time that disproportionately drive patterns of watershed \nNO3\u2212 export.\n",

Tracer movement over the 2009 and 2010 field seasons was monitored using tile drain effluent, suction lysimeters, monitoring wells, and soil cores. Despite similar volumes of water application to the plot in each season, 10 times more water and 14 times more DFBA were captured by the drains in 2010 due to wetter regional hydrologic conditions. The importance of preferential flow along macropores was shown by rapid DFBA breakthrough to the tile (<47 h), and DFBA detections in sand units below the tile drains. Preferential flow resulted in less than 8% of the DFBA mass being captured by the tiles over both years. With much of the DFBA mass (75%) retained in the upper 0.25 m of the soil at the end of 2009, numerical simulations were used to quantify the migration of this in situ tracer during the subsequent 2010 field season. Dual permeability and dual porosity models produced similar matches to measured tile drain flows and concentrations, but solute leaching was captured more effectively by the dual permeability formulation. The simulations highlighted limitations in current descriptions for small-scale mass transfer between matrix and macropore domains, which do not consider time-dependent transfer coefficients or nonuniform distributions of solute mass within soil matrix blocks.\n",

Understanding its response to rainfall variability requires consideration of multiple time scales. We examine intra-annual to multiyear relationships using model simulations of soil moisture and vegetation growth over 50 years in the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California (USA). Ecohydrological model parameters are conditioned on field and remote sensing data using an ensemble Kalman filter. Although no specific periodicities were detected in the rainfall record, simulated leaf-area-index exhibits multiyear dynamics that are driven by multiyear (\u223c3 years) rains, but with up to a 1 year delay in peak response. Within a multiyear period, Larrea tridentata is more sensitive to winter rains than summer. In the most active part of the root zone (above \u223c80 cm), >1 year average soil moisture drives vegetation growth, but monthly average soil moisture is controlled by root uptake. Moisture inputs reach the lower part of the root zone (below \u223c80 cm) infrequently, but once there they can persist over a year to help sustain plant growth. Parameter estimates highlight efficient plant physiological properties facilitating persistent growth and high soil hydraulic conductivity allowing deep soil moisture stores. We show that soil moisture as an ecological indicator is complicated by bidirectional interactions with vegetation that depend on time scale and depth. Under changing climate, Larrea tridentata will likely be relatively resilient to shorter-term moisture variability but will exhibit higher sensitivity to shifts in seasonal to multiyear moisture inputs.\n",

Although probabilistic forecasting is common, conventional methods for assessing the reliability of these forecasts are approximate. Among the most common methods for assessing reliability, the decomposed Brier Score and Reliability Diagram treat an observed string of events as samples from multiple Binomial distributions, but this is an approximation of the forecast reliability, leading to unnecessary loss of information. This article suggests testing the hypothesis of reliability via the Poisson-Binomial distribution, which is a generalized solution to the Binomial distribution, providing a more accurate model of the probabilistic event forecast verification setting. Further, a two-stage approach to reliability assessment is suggested to identify errors in the forecast related to both bias and overly/insufficiently sharp forecasts. Such a methodology is shown to more effectively distinguish between reliable and unreliable forecasts, leading to more robust probabilistic forecast verification.\n",

Existing catchment models that predict stream temperature use a variety of approaches to estimate throughflow temperatures, but none has been evaluated against field measurements of throughflow temperature. In this study, throughflow temperatures were monitored over two winters at 50 locations adjacent to a headwater stream (11 ha catchment area) located in the rain-on-snow zone of the Pacific Northwest. Existing approaches to estimate throughflow temperature under or overpredicted throughflow temperatures by up to 5\u00b0C, or were unable to represent the influence of transient snow cover. Therefore, a conceptual-parametric model that is computationally efficient was developed that simulates hillslope hydrology and throughflow temperatures. The model structure includes an upslope reservoir that drains into a downslope reservoir that, in turn, drains into the stream. Vertical and lateral energy and water fluxes are simulated using simplified process representations. The model successfully predicts throughflow temperatures and highlights the dominant role of throughflow advection and the influence of snow cover on stream thermal regimes during high flow periods and rain-on-snow events.\n",

From 1995 to 2013, 13 of 19 years showed rainfall less than the mean, which has a probability <8.35% of chance occurrence. We used nonparametric statistical analysis and found 38 of 58 stations experienced an annual rainfall decrease at an average rate of 1.2 mm/yr. Over all 58 stations, the average decrease was 0.41 mm/yr. The annual coefficient of variation of daily rainfall showed a long-term increase of \u223c2\u20133% at 90% of stations. Analysis of annual variance of daily rainfall suggests decreasing variance in the low rainfall areas to the southwest and east and increasing variance in the high rainfall areas to the northwest, a pattern consistent with principal component analysis.

Hydrologic modelers typically calibrate models to optimize residual-based goodness-of-fit measures, e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency measure, and then evaluate the obtained results with respect to hydrological signatures, e.g., the flow duration curve indices. The literature indicates that the consideration of a large number of hydrologic signatures has not been addressed in a full multiobjective optimization context. This research develops a model calibration methodology to achieve hydrological consistency using goodness-of-fit measures, many hydrological signatures, as well as a level of acceptability for each signature. The proposed framework relies on a scoring method that transforms any hydrological signature to a calibration objective. These scores are used to develop the hydrological consistency metric, which is maximized to obtain hydrologically consistent parameter sets during calibration. This consistency metric is implemented in different signature-based calibration formulations that adapt the sampling according to hydrologic signature values. These formulations are compared with the traditional formulations found in the literature for seven case studies. The results reveal that Pareto dominance-based multiobjective optimization yields the highest level of consistency among all formulations. Furthermore, it is found that the choice of optimization algorithms does not affect the findings of this research.\n",

Conservation and/or expansion of riparian shade could counter warming and buy time for ecosystems to adapt. However, sensitivity of river reaches to direct solar radiation is highly heterogeneous in space and time, so benefits of shading are also expected to be site specific. We use a network of high-resolution temperature measurements from two upland rivers in the UK, in conjunction with topographic shade modeling, to assess the relative significance of landscape and riparian shade to the thermal behavior of river reaches. Trees occupy 7% of the study catchments (comparable with the UK national average) yet shade covers 52% of the area and is concentrated along river corridors. Riparian shade is most beneficial for managing Tw at distances 5\u201320 km downstream from the source of the rivers where discharge is modest, flow is dominated by near-surface hydrological pathways, there is a wide floodplain with little landscape shade, and where cumulative solar exposure times are sufficient to affect Tw. For the rivers studied, we find that approximately 0.5 km of complete shade is necessary to off-set Tw by 1\u00b0C during July (the month with peak Tw) at a headwater site; whereas 1.1 km of shade is required 25 km downstream. Further research is needed to assess the integrated effect of future changes in air temperature, sunshine duration, direct solar radiation, and downward diffuse radiation on Tw to help tree planting schemes achieve intended outcomes.\n",

In this study, three runoff characteristics: hydrograph response, time source of runoff water, and flow path are used to classify catchments. Published data from the scientific literature are used to provide evidence from small, forested catchments. Each catchment was assigned to one of the eight conceptual models, depending on the combination of quick/slow response, old/new water, and overland/subsurface flow. A standard procedure was developed to objectively diagnose the predominant conceptual model of stormflow generation for each catchment and assess its temporal and spatial support. The literature survey yielded 42 catchments, of which 30 catchments provide a complete set of qualitative runoff characteristics resulting in one of the eight conceptual models. The majority of these catchments classify as subsurface flow path dominated. No catchments were found for conceptual models representing combinations of quick response-new water-subsurface flow (SSF), slow-new-SSF, slow-old-overland flow (OF) nor new-slow-OF. Of the 30 qualitatively classified catchments, 24 provide a complete set of quantitative measures. In summary, the field support is strong for 19 subsurface-dominated catchments and is weak for 5 surface flow path dominated catchments (six catchments had insufficient quantitative data). Two alternative explanations exist for the imbalance of field support between the two flow path classes: (1) the selection of research catchments in past field studies was mainly to explain quick hydrograph response in subsurface dominated catchments; (2) catchments with prevailing subsurface flow paths are more common in nature. We conclude that the selection of research catchments needs to cover a wider variety of environmental conditions which should lead to a broader, and more widely applicable, spectrum of resulting conceptual models and process mechanisms. This is a prerequisite in studies where catchment organization and similarity approaches are used to develop catchment classification systems in order to regionalize stormflow.\n",

In this study, by using high-frequency isotope measurements and continuous surface water measurements, we investigated the isotope ratios in soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer and the physical mechanisms involved over a paddy field for a full growing season. The isotopic signals of \u03b4ET, \u03b4T, and \u03b4E were determined by the Keeling plot method, surface water isotopic measurements, and the Craig-Gordon model, respectively. The fraction of transpiration in evapotranspiration (FT) ranged from 0.2 to 1, with an almost continuous increase in the early growing season and a relatively constant value close to 1 later in the year. The result was supported by FT derived from simulated T and eddy correlation measured ET. The seasonal change in the transpiration fraction could be described quite well as a function of the LAI (FT\u2009=\u20090.67LAI0.25, R2\u2009=\u20090.80), implying that transpiration plays a dominant role in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum during the growing season. The two end-member uncertainty analysis suggested that further improvement in the estimation of \u03b4T and \u03b4ET is necessary for partitioning evapotranspiration using the isotopic method. In the estimation of \u03b4ET, the assumptions underlying Keeling plot method were rarely met and the uncertainty was quite large. A high frequency of precise isotopic measurements in surface water was also necessary for \u03b4T estimation. Furthermore, special care must be taken concerning the kinetic fractionation parameter in the Craig and Gordon Equation for \u03b4E estimation under low-LAI conditions. The results demonstrated the robustness of using isotope measurements for partitioning evapotranspiration.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe model for microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) published by Ebigbo et al. (2012) has been improved based on new insights obtained from experiments and model calibration. The challenge in constructing a predictive model for permeability reduction in the underground with MICP is the quantification of the complex interaction between flow, transport, biofilm growth, and reaction kinetics. New data from Lauchnor et al. (2015) on whole-cell ureolysis kinetics from batch experiments were incorporated into the model, which has allowed for a more precise quantification of the relevant parameters as well as a simplification of the reaction kinetics in the equations of the model. Further, the model has been calibrated objectively by inverse modeling using quasi-1D column experiments and a radial flow experiment. From the postprocessing of the inverse modeling, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis has been performed with focus on the model input parameters that were fitted in the course of the model calibration. It reveals that calcite precipitation and concentrations of \nNH4+ and \nCa2+ are particularly sensitive to parameters associated with the ureolysis rate and the attachment behavior of biomass. Based on the determined sensitivities and the ranges of values for the estimated parameters in the inversion, it is possible to identify focal areas where further research can have a high impact toward improving the understanding and engineering of MICP.\n",

Most previous studies made in temperate forests found that fluxes of carbon and nitrogen by runoff water varied in different forests, but few studies have been made in subtropical forests. This study was to investigate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) fluxes at the catchment scale along a subtropical forest succession gradient from pine forest (pioneer) to coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest (transitional) to broadleaved forest (mature). Our results showed that DOC concentration significantly decreased (p<0.001) while TDN concentration significantly increased (p<0.001) in runoff water from pioneer to mature forests, which in turn resulted in a decrease in DOC flux and an increase in TDN flux, as mean annual runoff did not vary significantly among three succession forest catchments. The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) annual DOC flux was 118.1\u00b143.6, 88.3\u00b116.7 and 77.2\u00b111.7 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121for pioneer, transitional and mature forest catchments, respectively; and the mean annual TDN flux was 9.9 \u00b12.7, 18.2\u00b13.0 and 21.2 \u00b14.5 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121for pioneer, transitional and mature forest catchments, respectively. The mature forest reduced DOC flux by increased soil chemical adsorption and physical protection. An increase in TDN flux from pioneer to mature forests was consistent with the previous finding that mature forest was nitrogen saturated while pioneer forest was nitrogen limited. Therefore large-scale conversion of pioneer forests to transitional or mature forests in subtropical China will reduce DOC concentration and increase TDN concentration in the down-stream water, which may have significant impact on its water quality and aquatic biological activities.\n",

Subdaily environmental flow constraints (ECs) on operations can be promising alternatives for mitigating negative impacts. However, those constraints reduce the flexibility of hydropower plants, potentially with higher costs for the power system. To study the economic and environmental efficiency of ECs, this work proposes a novel framework comprising four steps: (i) assessment of the current subdaily hydrologic alteration; (ii) formulation and implementation of a short-term, grid-wide hydrothermal coordination model; (iii) design of ECs in the form of maximum ramping rates (MRRs) and minimum flows (MIFs) for selected hydropower reservoirs; and (iv) identification of Pareto-efficient solutions in terms of grid-wide costs and the Richard-Baker flashiness index for subdaily hydrologic alteration (SDHA). The framework was applied to Chile's main power grid, assessing 25 EC cases, involving five MIFs and five MRRs. Each case was run for a dry, normal, and wet water year type. Three Pareto-efficient ECs are found, with remarkably small cost increase below 2% and a SDHA improvement between 28% and 90%. While the case involving the highest MIF worsens the flashiness of another basin, the other two have no negative effect on other basins and can be recommended for implementation.\n",

However, the term \u201csensitivity\u201d has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e.g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for \u201cglobal sensitivity\u201d across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different \u201cintuitive\u201d understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting \u201cglobal\u201d interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.\n",

Several methods exist to estimate the bed shear stress in bare channels without vegetation, but most of these are not appropriate for vegetated channels due to the impact of vegetation on the velocity profile and turbulence production. This study proposes a new model to estimate the bed shear stress in both vegetated and bare channels with smooth beds. The model, which is supported by measurements, indicates that for both bare and vegetated channels with smooth beds, within a viscous sublayer at the bed, the viscous stress decreases linearly with increasing distance from the bed, resulting in a parabolic velocity profile at the bed. For bare channels, the model describes the velocity profile in the overlap region of the Law of the Wall. For emergent canopies of sufficient density (frontal area per unit canopy volume \na\u22654.3\u2009m\u22121), the thickness of the linear-stress layer is set by the stem diameter, leading to a simple estimate for bed shear stress.\n",

Through observation syntheses and conceptual models, evidence are presented that groundwater influence is globally prevalent, it forms an environmental gradient not fully captured by the climate, and it can profoundly shape critical zone evolution at continental to global scales. Four examples are used to illustrate these ideas: (1) groundwater as a water source for plants in rainless periods, (2) water table depth as a driver of plant rooting depth, (3) the accessibility of groundwater as an ecological niche separator, and (4) groundwater as the lower boundary of land drainage and a global driver of wetlands. The implications to understanding past and future global environmental change are briefly discussed, as well as critical discipline, scale, and data gaps that must be bridged in order for us to translate what we learn in the field at column, hillslope and catchment scales, to what we must predict at regional, continental, and global scales.\n",

The level set method is a numerical technique for tracking moving interfaces based on the idea that the interface is a level set curve of a higher-dimensional function. Numerical simulations were compared to experiments conducted in a recirculating flume. Streambed heterogeneity led to water exchange between multiple bed forms, while in homogeneous streambeds the water exchange was restricted within a single bed form. A thin layer of homogeneous sediments at the top of the heterogeneous streambeds significantly increased the interfacial water influx, resulting in faster solute penetration and stream concentration decrease. Streambed heterogeneity generated horizontal preferential flow paths in the upper part of the bed while decreasing pore water velocities deeper in the bed, which hindered vertical penetration and consequently led to slower stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability or increasing horizontal permeability led to slower vertical penetration and stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability had a much more significant impact on solute penetration than increasing horizontal permeability, because mass transfer in hyporheic exchange is greatly dominated by vertical advection which depends primarily on the vertical permeability. This study was the first to apply the level set method in the study of hyporheic exchange. The theoretical and numerical methods have important applications in subsurface flow and transport processes.\n",

Soil moisture is the integrand of the water cycle, reflecting dynamics of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff in space and time, and a key determinant of yield. Here we present projected changes in the hydrologic cycle over a representative area of the American Midwest from regional climate model experiments that sample a range of model configurations. While significant summer soil moisture drying is predicted in some ensemble members, others predict soil moisture wetting, with the sign of soil moisture response strongly influenced by choice of boundary conditions. To resolve the contradictory predictions of soil moisture across ensemble members, we assess an extensive and unique observational data set of the water budget in Illinois. No statistically significant monotonic trends are found in observed soil moisture, precipitation, streamflow, groundwater level, or 2 m air temperature over a recent 26 year period (soil moisture 25 years). Based on this analysis of model simulations and observations, we conclude that the sign of climate change impacts on the regional hydrology of the American Midwest remains uncertain.\n",

It hosts myriad hydrologically controlled processes that are potentially coupled in complex ways. Understanding these processes and the connections between them is critical since these processes are not only important locally but integrate to impact increasingly larger scale biogeochemical functioning of the river corridor up to the river network scale. Thus, the hyporheic zone continues to be a growing research focus for many hydrologists for more than half the history of Water Resources Research. This manuscript partly summarizes the historical development of hyporheic zone hydrologic science as gleaned from papers published in Water Resources Research, from the birth of the concept of the hyporheic zone as a hydrologic black box (sometimes referred to as transient storage zone), to its adolescent years of being torn between occasionally competing research perspectives of interrogating the hyporheic zone from a surface or subsurface view, to its mature emergence as an interdisciplinary research field that employs the wide array of state-of-the-art tools available to the modern hydrologist. The field is vibrant and moving in the right direction of addressing critical fundamental and applied questions with no clear end in sight in its growth. There are exciting opportunities for scientists that are able to tightly link the allied fields of geology, geomorphology, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology to tackle the many open problems in hyporheic zone science.\n",

The skill of the main teleconnection indices as predictors of seasonal streamflow in the IP was evaluated. The streamflow database used was composed of 382 stations, covering the period 1975\u20132008. Predictions were made using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach based on multiple linear regression, combining Variance Inflation Factor and Stepwise Backward selection to avoid multicollinearity and select the best subset of predictors. Predictions were made for four forecasting scenarios, from one to four seasons in advance. The correlation coefficient (RHO), Root Mean Square Error Skill Score (RMSESS), and the Gerrity Skill Score (GSS) were used to evaluate the forecasting skill. For autumn streamflow, good forecasting skill (RHO>0.5, RMSESS>20%, GSS>0.4) was found for a third of the stations located in the Mediterranean Andalusian Basin, the North Atlantic Oscillation of the previous winter being the main predictor. Also, fair forecasting skill (RHO>0.44, RMSESS>10%, GSS>0.2) was found in stations in the northwestern IP (16 of these located in the Douro and Tagus Basins) with two seasons in advance. For winter streamflow, fair forecasting skill was found for one season in advance in 168 stations, with the Snow Advance Index as the main predictor. Finally, forecasting was poorer for spring streamflow than for autumn and winter, since only 16 stations showed fair forecasting skill in with one season in advance, particularly in north-western of IP.\n",

A more challenging problem occurs when the errors are insidious, i.e., not readily detectable, and the error-laden data appear useful for model testing and development. We present two case studies, one related to the water balance in the snow-fed Tuolumne River, Sierra Nevada, California, combined with modeling using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM); and one related to the energy balance at Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, combined with modeling using the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA). In the Tuolumne, modeled streamflow in 1 year was more than twice as large as observed; at Snoqualmie, modeled nighttime surface temperatures were biased by about +10\u00b0C. Both appeared to be modeling failures, until detective work uncovered observational errors. We conclude with a discussion of what these cases teach us about science in an age of specialized research, when one person collects data, a separate person conducts model simulations, and a computer is charged with data quality assurance.\n",

This paper analyzes the roles and benefits of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and market-based water transfers in an integrated regional water system where agricultural and urban water users coordinate supply and demand management based on supply reliability and economic values of water. Agricultural users optimize land and water use for annual and perennial crops to maximize farm income, while urban users choose short-term and long-term water conservation actions to maintain reliability and minimize costs. The temporal order of these decisions is represented in a two-stage optimization that maximizes the net expected benefits of crop production, urban conservation and water management including conjunctive use and water transfers. Long-term decisions are in the first stage and short-term decisions are in a second stage based on probabilities of water availability events. Analytical and numerical analyses are made. Results show that conjunctive use and water transfers can substantially stabilize farmer's income and reduce system costs by reducing expensive urban water conservation or construction. Water transfers can equalize marginal values of water across users, while conjunctive use minimizes water marginal value differences in time. Model results are useful for exploring the integration of different water demands and supplies through water transfers, conjunctive use, and conservation, providing valuable insights for improving system management.\n",

The purpose of this contribution is first to draw attention to existing theories of age distributions in population dynamics, fluid mechanics and stochastic groundwater, and in particular to the McKendrick-von Foerster equation and its generalizations and solutions. A second and more important goal is to clarify that, when hydrologic fluxes are modeled by means of time-varying stochastic processes, the age distributions must themselves be treated as random functions. Once their probabilistic structure is obtained, it can be used to characterize the variability of age distributions in real systems and thus help quantify the inherent uncertainty in the field determination of water age. We illustrate these concepts with reference to a stochastic storage model, which has been used as a minimalist model of soil moisture and streamflow dynamics.\n",

Continuous soil moisture spatiotemporal dynamics at an exemplary hillslope domain were computed for six case studies characterized by different climate and vegetation cover and for three configurations of soil properties. It was shown that abiotic controls largely exceed their biotic counterparts in wet climates. Biotic controls on Cv(\u03b8) were found to be more pronounced in Mediterranean climates. The relation between Cv(\u03b8) and spatial mean soil moisture \n\u03b8\u00af was found to be unique in wet locations, regardless of the soil properties. For the case of homogeneous soil texture, hysteretic cycles between Cv(\u03b8) and \n\u03b8\u00af were observed in all Mediterranean climate locations considered here and to a lesser extent in a deciduous temperate forest. Heterogeneity in soil properties increased Cv(\u03b8) to values commensurate with field observations and weakened signatures of hysteresis at all of the studied locations.

Formations with spatially connected fine-textured and coarse-textured features (F-formation and C-formation, respectively), representing the10th and the 90th percentiles of the distributions of the formation's hydraulic parameters, respectively, were considered here. Results of the analyses suggest that in steady state flow, when the unsaturated zone of the combined flow domains is relatively wet, as compared with a Multivariate-Gaussian (MG) formation, spatially connected features may reduce the solute first arrival time, particularly in the C-formation, and may enhance the spreading of the solute breakthrough, particularly in the F-formation. The effect of the spatially connected features on the hydrological response, however, decreases as the unsaturated zone becomes drier. The latter result stems from the decrease in the fraction of the water-filled, pore-space occupied by the connected structures, with decreasing water content. The latter finding also explains the result that the response of more realistic, combined flow systems, whose unsaturated zone is associated with relatively low, intermittent water contents, is essentially independent of the spatially connected features of the formations, regardless of their soil texture.\n",

In this research, a new EMI system (the CMD mini-Explorer) is used for subsurface characterization of soil salinity in a drip irrigation system via a joint inversion approach of multiconfiguration EMI measurements. EMI measurements were conducted across a farm where Acacia trees are irrigated with brackish water. In situ measurements of vertical bulk electrical conductivity (\u03c3b) were recorded in different pits along one of the transects to calibrate the EMI measurements and to compare with the modeled electrical conductivity (\u03c3) obtained by the joint inversion of multiconfiguration EMI measurements. Estimates of \u03c3 were then converted into the universal standard of soil salinity measurement (i.e., electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract \u2013 ECe). Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) was repeatedly measured with the CMD mini-Explorer to investigate the temperature stability of the new system at a fixed location, where the ambient air temperature increased from 26\u00b0C to 46\u00b0C. Results indicate that the new EMI system is very stable in high temperature environments, especially above 40\u00b0C, where most other approaches give unstable measurements. In addition, the distribution pattern of soil salinity is well estimated quantitatively by the joint inversion of multicomponent EMI measurements. The approach of joint inversion of EMI measurements allows for the quantitative mapping of the soil salinity distribution pattern and can be utilized for the management of soil salinity.\n",

Hotspot regions are identified at low elevations in the Andean foothills (400\u2013700 masl) and in windward conditions at Quincemil and Chipiriri, where more than 4000 mm rainfall per year are recorded. Orographic effects and exposure to easterly winds produce a strong annual rainfall gradient between the lowlands and the Andes that can reach 190 mm/km. Although TRMM-PR reproduces the spatial distribution satisfactorily, it underestimates rainfall by 35% in the hotspot regions. In the Peruvian hotspot, exceptional rainfall occurs during the austral dry season (around 1000 mm in June\u2013July\u2013August; JJA), but not in the Bolivian hotspot. The direction of the low-level winds over the Andean foothills partly explains this difference in the seasonal rainfall cycle. At intraseasonal scales in JJA, we found that, during northerly wind regimes, positive rainfall anomalies predominate over the lowland and the eastern flank of the Andes, whereas less rain falls at higher altitudes. On the other hand, during southerly regimes, rainfall anomalies are negative in the hotspot regions. The influence of cross-equatorial winds is particularly clear below 2000 masl.\n",

Using LiDAR technology with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), high-resolution data on the SD distribution were acquired during the 2011\u20132012 and 2012\u20132013 snow seasons, which were 2 years having very contrasting climatic and snow accumulation conditions. Average SD evolution in open and canopy areas was characterized. Principal component analysis was applied to identify days having similar spatial patterns of SD distribution. There was a clear contrast in the temporal variability of the snowpack in different areas of the forest stand, corresponding generally to beneath the canopy, and in open sites. The canopy and openings showed markedly different accumulation and melting, with higher snow accumulation found in openings. Differences ranged from 14 to 80% reduction (average 49%) in the SD beneath the canopy relative to open sites. The difference in SD between open and canopy areas increased throughout the snow season. The surveyed days were classified in terms of SD distribution, and included days associated with: high SD, low SD, intense melting conditions and periods when the SD distribution was driven by wind conditions. The SD increased with distance from the trunks to a distance of 3.5\u20134.5 m, coinciding with the average size of the crown of individual trees.\n",

For multipurpose reservoir systems, forecast types include (i) forecasts of upcoming inflows and (ii) forecasts of system variables and outputs such as reservoir levels, releases, flood damage risks, hydropower production, water supply withdrawals, water quality conditions, navigation opportunities, and environmental flows, among others. Forecasts of system variables and outputs are conditional on forecasted inflows as well as on specific management policies and can provide useful information for decision-making processes. Unlike inflow forecasts (in ensemble or other forms), which have been the subject of many previous studies, reservoir system variable and output forecasts are not formally assessed in water resources management theory or practice. This article addresses this gap and develops methods to rectify potential reservoir system forecast inconsistencies and improve the quality of management-relevant information provided to stakeholders and managers. The overarching conclusion is that system variable and output forecast consistency is critical for robust reservoir management and needs to be routinely assessed for any management model used to inform planning and management processes. The above are demonstrated through an application from the Sacramento-American-San Joaquin reservoir system in northern California.\n",

Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km2, glaciarized area: 2%), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice melt-dominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspiration-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.\n",

Alterations of the water quality linked to the river morphology can affect the ecosystems and human development in the long term. The future construction of a reservoir in the Lluta River, located in northern Chile, will change the spatial distribution of arsenic-rich sediments, which can have significant effects on the lower parts of the watershed. In this investigation, we develop a coupled numerical model to predict and evaluate the interactions between morphodynamic changes in the Lluta reservoir, and conditions that can potentially desorb arsenic from the sediments. Assuming that contaminants are mobilized under anaerobic conditions, we calculate the oxygen concentration within the sediments to study the interactions of the delta progradation with the potential arsenic release. This work provides a framework for future studies aimed to analyze the complex connections between morphodynamics and water quality, when contaminant-rich sediments accumulate in a reservoir. The tool can also help to design effective risk management and remediation strategies in these extreme environments.\n",

Wavelet analysis has proven useful for detecting hydrologic alterations at multiple scales via the wavelet power spectrum (WPS) series. The existing approach based on the global WPS (GWPS) ratio tends to be dominated by the rare high-power flows so that alterations of the more frequent low-power flows are often underrepresented. We devise a new approach based on individual deviations between WPS (DWPS) that are root-mean-squared to yield the global DWPS (GDWPS). We test these two approaches on the three reaches of the Feitsui Reservoir system (Taiwan) that are subjected to different classes of anthropogenic interventions. The GDWPS reveal unique features that are not detected with the GWPS ratios. We also segregate the effects of individual subflow components on the overall flow regime alterations using the subflow GDWPS. The results show that the daily hydropeaking waves below the reservoir not only intensified the flow oscillations at daily scale but most significantly eliminated subweekly flow variability. Alterations of flow regime were most severe below the diversion weir, where the residual hydropeaking resulted in a maximum impact at daily scale while the postdiversion null flows led to large hydrologic alterations over submonthly scales. The smallest impacts below the confluence reveal that the hydrologic alterations at scales longer than 2 days were substantially mitigated with the joining of the unregulated tributary flows, whereas the daily-scale hydrologic alteration was retained because of the hydropeaking inherited from the reservoir releases. The proposed DWPS approach unravels for the first time the details of flow regime alterations at these intermediate scales that are overridden by the low-frequency high-power flows when the long-term averaged GWPS are used.\n",

In reconstructed streams, the initial morphological response of the new streams is often rapid, until a dynamic equilibrium is reached. Here we report on a chute cutoff that occurred within 3 months after realization of a stream restoration project, caused by a plug bar that formed in response to a backwater effect. The temporal evolution of the morphology of both the new and the old channels was monitored over a period of nearly 8 months, including precutoff conditions. The observations can be separated into three stages. Stage 1 is the initial period leading to cutoff vulnerability, stage 2 is the actual cutoff, and stage 3 is the morphological adjustment in response to the cutoff. In stage 1, a plug bar was deposited in one of the channel bends. Hydrodynamic model results show the location of the plug bar coincides with a region where bed shear stress decreased in downstream direction due to backwater. Longitudinal channel bed profiles show that the channel slope decreased soon after channel reconstruction. Hence, sediment from upstream was available to form the plug bar. After the plug bar was deposited, an embayment formed in the floodplain at a location where the former channel was located (stage 2). The former channel was filled with sediment prior to channel construction. It is likely that the sediment at this location was less consolidated, and therefore, prone to erosion. The chute channel continued to incise and widen into the floodplain and, after 6 months, acted as the main channel, conveying the discharge during the majority of time (stage 3). The cutoff channel gradually continued to fill with sediment, from the moment the plug bar formed until the chute channel incised into the floodplain. Sedimentary successions of the deposited material show upward fining, which is in agreement with observations of chute cutoffs in rivers. Although the artificial setting limits the degree in which the observed processes can be projected on natural rivers, the observations prompt to investigate the role of backwater effects in natural chute cutoff initiation.\n",

In particular, several attempts to constrain the hydrogeophysical inverse problem to reduce inversion errors have been made using time-lapse geophysical measurements through both coupled and uncoupled (also known as sequential) inversion approaches. Despite the appeal and popularity of coupled inversion approaches, their superiority over uncoupled methods has not been proved conclusively; the goal of this work is to provide an objective comparison between the two approaches within a specific inversion modeling framework based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Using EnKF and a model of Lagrangian transport, we compare the performance of a fully coupled and uncoupled inversion method for the reconstruction of heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity fields through the assimilation of ERT-monitored tracer test data. The two inversion approaches are tested in a number of different scenarios, including isotropic and anisotropic synthetic aquifers, where we change the geostatistical parameters used to generate the prior ensemble of hydraulic conductivity fields. Our results show that the coupled approach outperforms the uncoupled when the prior statistics are close to the ones used to generate the true field. Otherwise, the coupled approach is heavily affected by \u201cfilter inbreeding\u201d (an undesired effect of variance underestimation typical of EnKF), while the uncoupled approach is more robust, being able to correct biased prior information, thanks to its capability of capturing the solute travel times even in presence of inversion artifacts such as the violation of mass balance. Furthermore, the coupled approach is more computationally intensive than the uncoupled, due to the much larger number of forward runs required by the electrical model. Overall, we conclude that the relative merit of the coupled versus the uncoupled approach cannot be assumed a priori and should be assessed case by case.\n",

Drag forces have been measured in a flume for simple cylindrical obstructions of the same shape and size but with different flexibility under several flow conditions. This data set is used to fit drag parameters and to relate their value to flexibility through the Cauchy Number. A formulation is presented where the drag coefficient is evaluated as a function of a new calibration velocity parameter which is related to the elastic modulus of the obstruction. While the use of a Vogel exponent and reference velocity provides a similar response, the reference velocity when used is somewhat nebulous and appears to have a critical impact on the parameter and the drag force calculated. The proposed formulation for drag reduction is more consistently estimated for the range of flexibilities in this study.\n",

This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.\n",

Relatively low-density gradients due to an initial salt pulse concentration of 1.55 kg m\u22123 applied in the experiment were found to modulate significantly the pore-water flow and solute transport in the riverbed. Such density gradients increased downward flow and solute transport in the riverbed by factors up to 1.6. This resulted in a 12.2% increase in the total salt transfer from the water column to the riverbed over the salt pulse period. As the solute pulse passed, the effect of the density gradients reversed, slowing down the release of the solute back to the river water by a factor of 3.7. Numerical modeling indicated that these density effects intensified as salt concentrations in the water column increased. Simulations further showed that the density gradients might even lead to unstable flow and result in solute fingers in the bed of large bed forms. The slow release of solute from the bed back to the river led to a long tail of solute concentration in the river water. These findings have implications for assessment of impact of pollution events on river systems, in particular, long-term effects on both the river water and riverbed due to the hyporheic exchange.\n",

The system is modeled by first-order, hyperbolic partial differential equations subject to periodic forcing. The estimation problem can then be formulated as the minimization of the difference between the observed variables and model outputs, and eventually provide the velocity and water stage of the hydrodynamic system. The governing equations are linearized and discretized using an implicit discretization scheme, resulting in linear equality constraints in the optimization program. Thus, the flow estimation can be formed as an optimization problem and efficiently solved. The effectiveness of the proposed method was substantiated by a large-scale field experiment in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in California. A fleet of 100 sensors developed at the University of California, Berkeley, were deployed in Walnut Grove, CA, to collect a set of Lagrangian data, a time series of positions as the sensors moved through the water. Measurements were also taken from Eulerian sensors in the region, provided by the United States Geological Survey. It is shown that the proposed method can effectively integrate Lagrangian and Eulerian measurement data, resulting in a suited estimation of the flow variables within the hydraulic system.\n",

Such contributions can be estimated via hydrological models, provided that the modeling adequately accounts for snow and glacier melt, as well as rainfall runoff. We present a multiple data set calibration approach to estimate runoff composition using hydrological models with three levels of complexity. For this purpose, the code of the conceptual runoff model HBV-light was enhanced to allow calibration and validation of simulations against glacier mass balances, satellite-derived snow cover area and measured discharge. Three levels of complexity of the model were applied to glacierized catchments in Switzerland, ranging from 39 to 103 km2. The results indicate that all three observational data sets are reproduced adequately by the model, allowing an accurate estimation of the runoff composition in the three mountain streams. However, calibration against only runoff leads to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates. Based on these results, we recommend using all three observational data sets in order to constrain model parameters and compute snow, glacier, and rain contributions. Finally, based on the comparison of model performance of different complexities, we postulate that the availability and use of different data sets to calibrate hydrological models might be more important than model complexity to achieve realistic estimations of runoff composition.\n",

To better understand local impacts of regional climate change, we conducted model experiments to determine hydrologic sensitivities of annual, seasonal, and monthly runoff to imposed annual and seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature. We used the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land-surface hydrology model applied at 1/16\u00b0 latitude-longitude spatial resolution over the Pacific Northwest (PNW), a scale sufficient to support analyses at the hydrologic unit code eight (HUC-8) basin level. These experiments resolve the spatial character of the sensitivity of future water supply to precipitation and temperature changes by identifying the seasons and locations where climate change will have the biggest impact on runoff. The PNW exhibited a diversity of responses, where transitional (intermediate elevation) watersheds experience the greatest seasonal shifts in runoff in response to cool season warming. We also developed a methodology that uses these hydrologic sensitivities as basin-specific transfer functions to estimate future changes in long-term mean monthly hydrographs directly from climate model output of precipitation and temperature. When principles of linearity and superposition apply, these transfer functions can provide feasible first-order estimates of the likely nature of future seasonal streamflow change without performing downscaling and detailed model simulations.\n",

As a result, water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil may be altered in the presence of surfactants. In this study, the effects of a representative nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100, on coupled water flow and nonreactive solute transport during unsaturated flow conditions were evaluated. Batch reactor experiments were conducted to measure the surfactant sorption characteristics, while unsaturated transport experiments were performed in columns packed with 40\u2013270 mesh Ottawa sand at five initial water contents. Following the introduction of surfactant solution, the rate of water percolation through the sand increased; however, this period of rapid water drainage was followed by decreased water percolation due to the reduction in soil water content and the corresponding decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity behind the surfactant front. The observed changes in water percolation occurred sequentially, and resulted in faster nonreactive solute transport than was observed in the absence of surfactant. A one-dimensional mathematical model accurately described coupled water flow, surfactant, and solute transport under most experimental conditions. Differences between model predictions and experimental data were observed in the column study performed at the lowest water content (0.115 cm3/cm3), which was attributed to surfactant adsorption at the air-water interface. These findings demonstrate the potential influence of surfactants additives on unsaturated water flow and solute transport in soils, and demonstrate a methodology to couple these processes in a predictive modeling tool.\n",

Recently, physical sand-tank modeling has shown overshoot to be a physical process. In this paper, we have carried out numerical modeling of SLR-SI to demonstrate that overshoot can occur at the field scale within unconfined aquifers. This result is contrary to previous conclusions drawn from a restricted number of cases. In addition, we show that SI overshoot is plausible under scenarios of gradual sea level rise that are consistent with conditions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Overshoot was found to be largest in flux-controlled unconfined aquifers characterized by low freshwater flux, high specific yield, and large inland extent. These conditions result in longer timeframes for the aquifer to reach new steady state conditions following SLR, and the extended period prior to reequilibration of the groundwater flow field produces more extensive overshoot.\n",

Subsequently, a hierarchical regression was conducted with the only relevant contextual factor entered in the first step (R2 = 6.7%) and the sociopsychological factors added in the second step (R2 = 62.5%). Results showed that households using a clay container for drinking water storage had a significantly weaker habit of cleaning their water storage containers with soap and water than did households using other types of containers (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.10). The most important sociopsychological predictors of habitual cleaning were commitment (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.35), forgetting (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22), and self-efficacy (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.14). The combined investigation of contextual and sociopsychological factors proved beneficial in terms of developing intervention strategies. Possible interventions based on these findings are recommended.\n",

Residual trapping of CO2 through capillary forces within the pore space of the reservoir is one of the most significant mechanisms for storage security and is also a factor determining the ultimate extent of CO2 migration within the reservoir. In this study we have evaluated the impact of reservoir conditions of pressure, temperature, and brine salinity on the residual trapping characteristic curve of a fired Berea sandstone rock. The observations demonstrate that the initial-residual characteristic trapping curve is invariant across a wide range of pressure, temperature, and brine salinities and is also the same for CO2-brine systems as a N2-water system. The observations were made using a reservoir condition core-flooding laboratory that included high-precision pumps, temperature control, the ability to recirculate fluids for weeks at a time, and an X-ray CT scanner. Experimental conditions covered pressures of 5\u201320 MPa, temperatures of 25\u201350\u00b0C, and 0\u20135 mol/kg NaCl brine salinity. A novel coreflooding approach was developed, making use of the capillary end effect to create a large range in initial CO2 saturation (0.15\u20130.6) in a single coreflood. Upon subsequent flooding with CO2-equilibriated brine, the observation of residual saturation corresponded to the wide range of initial saturations before flooding resulting in a rapid construction of the initial-residual curve. For each condition we report the initial-residual curve and the resulting parameterization of the Land hysteresis models.\n",

However, the application of this method is hampered by its susceptibility to the presence of aboveground biomass. Here we present a simple empirical framework to account for moderation of fast neutrons by aboveground biomass in the calibration. The method extends the N0-calibration function and was developed using an extensive data set from a network of 10 cosmic ray probes located in the Rur catchment, Germany. The results suggest a 0.9% reduction in fast neutron intensity per 1 kg of dry aboveground biomass per m2 or per 2 kg of biomass water equivalent per m2. We successfully tested the novel vegetation correction using temporary cosmic ray probe measurements along a strong gradient in biomass due to deforestation, and using the COSMIC, and the hmf method as independent soil water content retrieval algorithms. The extended N0-calibration function was able to explain 95% of the overall variability in fast neutron intensity.\n",

Yet an optimal solution is optimal only for the modeled issues and managers often seek near-optimal alternatives that address unmodeled objectives, preferences, limits, uncertainties, and other issues. Early on, Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) formalized near-optimal as performance within a tolerable deviation from the optimal objective function value and identified a few maximally different alternatives that addressed some unmodeled issues. This paper presents new stratified, Monte-Carlo Markov Chain sampling and parallel coordinate plotting tools that generate and communicate the structure and extent of the near-optimal region to an optimization problem. Interactive plot controls allow users to explore region features of most interest. Controls also streamline the process to elicit unmodeled issues and update the model formulation in response to elicited issues. Use for an example, single-objective, linear water quality management problem at Echo Reservoir, Utah, identifies numerous and flexible practices to reduce the phosphorus load to the reservoir and maintain close-to-optimal performance. Flexibility is upheld by further interactive alternative generation, transforming the formulation into a multiobjective problem, and relaxing the tolerance parameter to expand the near-optimal region. Compared to MGA, the new blended tools generate more numerous alternatives faster, more fully show the near-optimal region, and help elicit a larger set of unmodeled issues.\n",

We thus developed and tested a modified LCL (MLCL) which takes into account local tortuosity and roughness, and works across a low range of local Reynolds Numbers. The MLCL is based on (1) modifying the aperture field by orienting it with the flow direction and (2) correcting for local roughness changes associated with local flow expansion/contraction. In order to test the MLCL, we compared it with direct numerical simulations with the Navier-Stokes equations using real and synthetic three-dimensional rough-walled fractures, previous corrected forms of the LCL, and experimental flow tests. The MLCL performed well and the effective errors (\u03b4) in volumetric flow rate range from \u22123.4% to 13.4% with an arithmetic mean of |\u03b4| (<|\u03b4|>) equal to 3.7%. The MLCL is more accurate than previous modifications of the LCL. We also investigated the error associated with applying the Cubic Law (CL) while utilizing modified aperture field. The \u03b4 from the CL ranges from \u221214.2% to 11.2%, with a slightly higher <|\u03b4|>\u2009=\u20096.1% than the MLCL.

However, real canopy systems have physical boundaries, where the flow enters and leaves patches of vegetation, generating a complex pressure field and velocity variations. Here we focus our study on the canopy entry region by examining the terms involved in the double (space and time) averaged momentum equations and their relative contribution to the total momentum balance. The estimation of each term is made possible by particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements in a model canopy constructed of randomly distributed thin glass plates. The instantaneous velocity fields were used to calculate the mean velocities, pressure, drag, Reynolds stresses, and dispersive stresses. It was found that within the entry region, the pressure gradient, the drag forces, and dispersive stresses are the three most significant terms that affect the balance in the streamwise momentum equation. In the vertical direction, the dispersive stresses are also significant and their contribution to the total momentum cannot be ignored. The study shows that dispersive stresses are initially formed around canopy edges; at both the entry region and the canopy top boundary. They start as a sink term, extracting momentum from the flow, and then become a source term that contributes momentum to the flow until they eventually decay at some short penetration distance into the canopy. These results reveal a new understanding on the evolution of momentum within the entry region, necessary in any closure modeling of flow in real canopies.\n",

The interpretation of the HPPT data, however, remains difficult due to the transition of flow conditions in the conducting structures and the hydraulic fracturing-induced permeability enhancement in the tested rocks. In this study, a number of HPPTs were performed in the sedimentary and intrusive rocks located at 450 m depth in central Hainan Island. The obtained Q-P curves were divided into a laminar flow phase (I), a non-Darcy flow phase (II), and a hydraulic fracturing phase (III). The critical Reynolds number for the deviation of flow from linearity into phase II was 25\u221266. The flow of phase III occurred in sparsely to moderately fractured rocks, and was absent at the test intervals of perfect or poor intactness. The threshold fluid pressure between phases II and III was correlated with RQD and the confining stress. An Izbash's law-based analytical model was employed to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of the tested rocks in different flow conditions. It was demonstrated that the estimated hydraulic conductivity values in phases I and II are basically the same, and are weakly dependent on the injection fluid pressure, but it becomes strongly pressure dependent as a result of hydraulic fracturing in phase III. The hydraulic conductivity at different test intervals of a borehole is remarkably enhanced at highly fractured zone or contact zone, but within a rock unit of weak heterogeneity, it decreases with the increase of depth.\n",

In the presence of spatial heterogeneities, however, so-called anomalous diffusion can occur, here the time exponent \nn\u226012. The objective of this paper is to present a numerical simulation that directly demonstrates the link between spacial heterogeneity and anomalous diffusion. The simulation is of the infiltration of a fluid into a horizontal unit area Hele-Shaw cell in which the permeability at specified locations, laid out as a Sierpinski fractal carpet pattern, can differ from the nominal value K\u2009=\u20091. When there is no permeability contrast, the fluid infiltration has a diffusion-like behavior, i.e., the filled plan-form area increases in time as \nF=Atn,n=12. When there is a permeability contrast, however, although the evolution of infiltration still follows a power law, anomalous behavior is observed; subdiffusive (\nn<12) when K\u2009<\u20091 and superdiffusive (\nn>12) when K\u2009>\u20091. These anomalous behaviors persist, even when the permeability contrast is only imposed over the largest sized fractal pattern element. But, if the pattern over which the permeability contrast is imposed has a subdomain length scale (obtained by filling in the largest sized element in the Sierpinski carpet with the smaller sized elements), normal diffusion \nn=12 behavior is recovered. In the special case that the imposed permeability in the pattern elements is \nK\u226a1, an approximate model, directly relating the coefficient and exponent in the infiltration power law to the porosity and fractal dimension of the carpet pattern, is derived and validated.\n",

Classical BTCs assume the presence of a single peak in the curve, where the location and size of the peak and the slope of the receding limb has been of particular interest. As more information is incorporated into BTCs (for example, with high-frequency data collection, supercomputing efforts), it is likely that classical definitions of BTC shapes will no longer be adequate descriptors for contaminant transport problems. We contend that individual BTCs may display multiple local peaks depending on the hydrogeologic conditions and the solute travel distance. In such cases, classical definitions should be reconsidered. In this work, the presence of local peaks in BTCs is quantified from high-resolution numerical simulations in synthetic fields with a particle tracking technique and a kernel density estimator to avoid either overly jagged or smoothed curves that could mask the results. Individual BTCs from three-dimensional heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields with varying combinations of statistical anisotropy, heterogeneity models, and local dispersivity are assessed as a function of travel distance. The number of local peaks, their corresponding slopes, and a transport connectivity index are shown to strongly depend on statistical anisotropy and travel distance. Results show that the choice of heterogeneity model also affects the frequency of local peaks, but the slope is less sensitive to model selection. We also discuss how solute shearing and rerouting can be determined from local peak quantification.\n",

This study developed a new surrogate-based approach, SOIM (Surrogate-based Optimization for Integrated surface water-groundwater Modeling), to incorporate the integrated modeling into water management optimization. Its applicability and advantages were evaluated and validated through an optimization research on the conjunctive use of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) for irrigation in a semiarid region in northwest China. GSFLOW, an integrated SW-GW model developed by USGS, was employed. The study results show that, due to the strong and complicated SW-GW interactions, basin-scale water saving could be achieved by spatially optimizing the ratios of groundwater use in different irrigation districts. The water-saving potential essentially stems from the reduction of nonbeneficial evapotranspiration from the aqueduct system and shallow groundwater, and its magnitude largely depends on both water management schemes and hydrological conditions. Important implications for water resources management in general include: first, environmental flow regulation needs to take into account interannual variation of hydrological conditions, as well as spatial complexity of SW-GW interactions; and second, to resolve water use conflicts between upper stream and lower stream, a system approach is highly desired to reflect ecological, economic, and social concerns in water management decisions. Overall, this study highlights that surrogate-based approaches like SOIM represent a promising solution to filling the gap between complex environmental modeling and real-world management decision-making.\n",

Drawing on social psychological literature, two experimental studies are presented, which explore messages that improve public perceptions of potable recycled water. The Elaboration-Likelihood Model of information processing and attitude change is tested and supported. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u2009415) premeasured support for recycled water, and trust in government information at Time 1. Messages varied in complexity and sidedness were presented at Time 2 (3 weeks later), and support and trust were remeasured. Support increased after receiving information, provided that participants received complex rather than simple information. Trust in government was also higher after receiving information. There was tentative evidence of this in response to two-sided messages rather than one-sided messages. Initial attitudes to recycled water moderated responses to information. Those initially neutral or ambivalent responded differently to simple and one-sided messages, compared to participants with positive or negative attitudes. Study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009957) tested the effectiveness of information about the low relative risks, and/or benefits of potable recycled water, compared to control groups. Messages about the low risks resulted in higher support when the issue of recycled water was relevant. Messages about benefits resulted in higher perceived issue relevance, but did not translate into greater support. The results highlight the importance of understanding people's motivation to process information, and need to tailor communication to match attitudes and stage of recycled water schemes' development.\n",

We investigated the effects of initial conditions on an integrated hydrologic model of a 5632 km2 domain in the northeastern U.S. Simulations were run for the year 1980 using four initial conditions spanning a range of average depth to water table, including 1 m (\u201cwet\u201d), 3m, 5m, and 7 m (\u201cdry\u201d) below land surface. Model outputs showed significant effects of initial conditions on basin-averaged variables such as subsurface storage, surface storage, and surface runoff, with the greatest impact observed on surface storage and runoff. Effects of initial conditions were related to meteorological conditions, with precipitation reducing the effects of initial conditions on surface storage and runoff. Additionally, feedbacks between soil moisture and land-energy fluxes affected the impacts of initial conditions: higher temperatures magnified the differences in storage, recharge, and discharge among the four initial-condition scenarios. Ten year recursive runs were conducted for the wet and dry scenarios. Spin-up times varied by model components and were considerably smaller for land-surface states and fluxes. Spin-up for dry initial conditions was slower than for wet initial conditions, indicating longer system memory for dry initial conditions. These variations in persistence of initial conditions should be taken into consideration when designing model initialization approaches. More broadly, this behavior is indicative of increased persistence of the effects of dry years as opposed to wet years in hydrologic systems.\n",

After estimating the current effects of the Three Gorges project and other reservoirs upstream on the Yangtze River on the fluvial phosphorus (P) in the middle and lower Yangtze River, we further investigated the long-term effects of dams on the fluvial regimes of P and P-enriched sediment (PES). Simultaneously measured P distributions with sediment size (PDSS) from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) proved that the areal density of particulate P (PP) bound on graded sediment can be measured using the surface area concentration of the total sediment. A PDSS relationship is obtained and the selective transport and long-term sedimentation of P are simulated using a nonuniform suspended sediment model, which incorporates the PDSS formula. The computations revealed that a reservoir would significantly lower the downstream availability of P in the dry season and promote high pulses of P in summer when the reservoir is flushed as sedimentation accumulates. As a result, the P buffering and replenishing mechanism in the pristine ecosystem from upstream supplies and local re-suspension are permanently eliminated when a regulating reservoir is built upstream. This change is irreversible if reservoir regulation continues. Changes could potentially aggravate the existing P-limitation, decrease the water's ability to adjust nutrient/pollutant fluctuations, accumulate a greater surplus of carbon and nitrogen, and even exacerbate blooms in favorable conditions.\n",

A three-dimensional numerical model of a natural in-stream gravel bar (20 m \u00d7 6 m) is presented. Multiple steady state streamflow is simulated with a computational fluid dynamics code that is sequentially coupled to a reactive transport groundwater model via the hydraulic head distribution at the streambed. Ambient groundwater flow is considered by scenarios of neutral, gaining, and losing conditions. The transformation of oxygen, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon by aerobic respiration and denitrification in the hyporheic zone are modeled, as is the denitrification of groundwater-borne nitrate when mixed with stream-sourced carbon. In contrast to fully submerged structures, hyporheic exchange flux decreases with increasing stream discharge, due to decreasing hydraulic head gradients across the partially submerged structure. Hyporheic residence time distributions are skewed in the log-space with medians of up to 8 h and shift to symmetric distributions with increasing level of submergence. Solute turnover is mainly controlled by residence times and the extent of the hyporheic exchange flow, which defines the potential reaction area. Although streamflow is the primary driver of hyporheic exchange, its impact on hyporheic exchange flux, residence times, and solute turnover is small, as these quantities exponentially decrease under losing and gaining conditions. Hence, highest reaction potential exists under neutral conditions, when the capacity for denitrification in the partially submerged structure can be orders of magnitude higher than in fully submerged structures.\n",

While previous work has focused either on the channels or on the islands, here we study the hydrological exchange between channels and islands and point at its important role in delta morphology and ecology. We focus our analysis on Wax Lake Delta in coastal Louisiana (USA) and characterize the surface water component of hydrological connectivity through measurements of water discharge and hydraulic tracer propagation. We find that deltaic islands are zones of significant water flux as 23\u201354% of the incoming distributary channel flux enters the islands. A calculation of the travel times through a channel-island complex shows travel times through the islands to be at least 3 times their channel counterparts. A dye release experiment also indicates that travel times in islands are much longer that those within channels as dye remained in the island for the 3.8 day duration of the experiment. Additionally, islands are more sensitive than channels to environmental forces such as tides, which cause flow reversal and thus can increase travel times through the islands. Our work defines the \u201chydrological network\u201d of a river delta to include not only the distributary channel network but also the interdistributary islands, quantifies the implications of channel-island hydrological connectivity to travel times through the system, and discusses the relevance of our findings to channel mouth dynamics at the delta front and the potential for denitrification in coastal systems.\n",

The LCL-ABL depth crossing is necessary for air saturation but not sufficient for cloud formation and subsequent convective rainfall occurrence. However, such crossing forms the main template for which all subsequent dynamical processes regulating the formation (or suppression) of convective rainfall operate on. If the feedback between surface fluxes and FA conditions is neglected, a reduction in latent heat flux associated with reduced WT levels is shown to enhance the ABL-LCL crossing probability. When the soil-plant system is fully coupled with ABL dynamics thereby allowing feedback with ABL temperature and humidity, FA states remain the leading control on CRP. However, vegetation water stress plays a role in controlling ABL-LCL crossing when the humidity supply by the FA is within an intermediate range of values. When FA humidity supply is low, cloud formation is suppressed independent of surface latent heat flux. Similarly, when FA moisture supply is high, cloud formation can occur independent of surface latent heat flux. In an intermediate regime of FA moisture supply, the surface latent heat flux controlled by soil water availability can supplement (or suppress) the necessary water vapor leading to reduced LCL and subsequent ABL-LCL crossing. It is shown that this intermediate state corresponds to FA values around the mode in observed humidity lapse rates \u03b3w (between \u22122.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 and \u22121.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 kg kg\u22121m\u22121), suggesting that vegetation water uptake may be controlling CRP at the study site.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIt is difficult to measure river discharge accurately in an estuary, and particularly, in the region where the tidal flow dominates over the river discharge. River discharge is important for the morphology and hydrodynamics of estuaries as it influences the salt intrusion process, tidal dynamics, freshwater supply (water resources management), and the occurrence of floods. Here we try to derive river regime characteristics from the seaward end: the estuary. It is found that there are empirical relationships that link the geometry of an estuary to its river regime, which can be used to estimate river discharge characteristics with the least of data available. The aims of this study are: (1) to derive empirical relations between geometrical characteristics of estuaries and the bankfull discharge; (2) to explore a physical explanation for this relation; and (3) to estimate the bankfull discharge in estuaries. The physical connection between an estuary and its river regime is found by combining estuary shape analysis, tidal dynamic analysis, and Lacey's hydraulic geometry theory. The relationships found between the estuary depth, width, and bankfull river discharge have been tested in 23 estuaries around the world (including seven recently surveyed estuaries). From the analysis, it shows that the depth of an estuary is a function of the bankfull flood discharge to the power of 1/3, which is in agreement with Lacey's formula. This finding not only provides a method to estimate estuary depth, it also allows estimating flood discharge characteristics from readily available estuary shape indicators.\n",

We present high-resolution experimental investigations in transparent analog variable-aperture fractures to improve understanding of chemical oxidation of residual entrapped trichloroethylene (TCE) in fractures. Four experiments were performed with different permanganate concentrations, flow rates, and initial TCE phase geometry. The initial aperture field and evolving entrapped-phase geometry were quantified for each experiment. The integrated mass transfer rate from the TCE phase for all experiments exhibited three time regimes: an early-time regime with slower mass transfer rates limited by low specific interfacial area; an intermediate-time regime with higher mass transfer rates resulting from breakup of large TCE blobs, which greatly increases specific interfacial area; and a late-time regime with low mass transfer rates due to the deposition of MnO2 precipitates. In two experiments, mass balance analyses suggested that TCE mass removal rates exceeded the maximum upper bound mass removal rates derived by assuming that oxidation and dissolution are the only mechanisms for TCE mass removal. We propose incomplete oxidation by permanganate and TCE solubility enhancement by intermediate reaction products as potential mechanisms to explain this behavior. We also speculate that some intermediate reaction products with surfactant-like properties may play a role in lowering the TCE-water interfacial tension, thus causing breakup of large TCE blobs. Our quantitative experimental measurements will be useful in the context of developing accurate computational models for chemical oxidation of TCE in fractures.\n",

The innovative contributions of this study are: (i) development of a Combined Hydro-Meteorological (CHM) index to extract the information of different influencing hydrometeorological variables, (ii) consideration of soil-hydrologic characteristics (through HSGs) and climate regime-based zoning for agriculture (through ACZs), and (iii) quantification of uncertainty range of the estimated soil moisture. Usage of Supervised Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) in the development of the CHM index helps to eliminate the \u201ccurse of dimensionality,\u201d typically arises in the multivariate analysis. The usage of SPCA also ensures the maximum possible association between the developed CHM index and soil moisture variation. The association between these variables is modeled through their joint distribution which is obtained by using the theory of copula. The proposed approach is also spatially transferable, since the information on HSGs and ACZs is considered. The \u201cleave-one-out\u201d cross-validation (LOO-CV) approach is adopted for stations belong to a particular HSG to examine the spatial transferability. The simulated soil moisture values are also compared with a few existing soil moisture data sets, derived from different Land Surface Models (LSMs) or retrieved from different satellite-based missions.

Because both head data and a priori information have effects on the inversed solution, assessing the meaningful information contained in head data alone is required to ensure comprehensive interpretation of inverse solutions, whether they are regularized or not. This study thus aims to assess the amount of information contained in tomographic slug tests head data to resolve heterogeneity in Kh, Kv/Kh, and Ss. Therefore, a resolution analysis based on truncated singular value decomposition of the sensitivity matrix with a noise level representative of field measurements is applied using synthetic data reflecting a known littoral aquifer. As an approximation of the hydraulic behavior of a real aquifer system, synthetic tomographic experiments and associated sensitivity matrices are generated using a radial flow model accounting for wellbore storage to simulate slug tests in a plane encompassing a stressed well and an observation well. Although fine-scale resolution of heterogeneities is limited by the diffusive nature of the groundwater flow equations, inversion of tomographic slug tests head data holds the potential to uniquely resolve coarse-scale heterogeneity in Kh, Kv/Kh, and Ss, as inscribed in the resolution matrix. This implies that tomographic head data can provide key information on aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy, but that fine-scale information must be supplied by a priori information to obtain finer details.\n",

However, to quantify these processes from stream water quality time series may be difficult because the governing mechanisms responsible for the concentration fluctuations span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In an attempt to address the quantification problem, we propose a novel methodology that includes a spectral decomposition of the watershed solute response using a distributed solute transport model for the network of transport pathways in surface and subsurface water. Closed form solutions of the transport problem in both the Laplace and Fourier domains are used to derive formal expressions of (i) the central temporal moments of a solute pulse response and (ii) the power spectral response of a solute concentration time series. By evaluating high-frequency hydrochemical data from the Upper Hafren Watershed, Wales, we linked the watershed dispersion mechanisms to the damping of the concentration fluctuations in different frequency intervals reflecting various environments responsible for the damping. The evaluation of the frequency-dependent model parameters indicate that the contribution of the different environments to the concentration fluctuations at the watershed effluent varies with period. For the longest periods (predominantly groundwater transport pathways) we found that the frequency typical transport time of chloride was 100 times longer and that sodium had a 2.5 times greater retardation factor compared with the shortest periods (predominantly shallow groundwater and surface water transport pathways).\n",

Given the capital intensive nature of the electric power industry, this can impact hydropower producers\u2019 ability to pay down outstanding debt, leading to credit rating downgrades, higher interests rates on new debt, and ultimately, greater infrastructure costs. One potential tool for reducing the financial exposure of hydropower producers to drought is hydrologic index insurance, in particular, contracts structured to payout when streamflows drop below a specified level. An ongoing challenge in developing this type of insurance, however, is minimizing contracts\u2019 \u201cbasis risk,\u201d that is, the degree to which contract payouts deviate in timing and/or amount from actual damages experienced by policyholders. In this paper, we show that consideration of year-to-year changes in the value of hydropower (i.e., the cost of replacing it with an alternative energy source during droughts) is critical to reducing contract basis risk. In particular, we find that volatility in the price of natural gas, a key driver of peak electricity prices, can significantly degrade the performance of index insurance unless contracts are designed to explicitly consider natural gas prices when determining payouts. Results show that a combined index whose value is derived from both seasonal streamflows and the spot price of natural gas yields contracts that exhibit both lower basis risk and greater effectiveness in terms of reducing financial exposure.\n",

Because natural systems show great variability and complexity with respect to soil, land cover, topography, precipitation, there exist large uncertainties and heterogeneities in model input factors. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using global sensitivity analysis (GSA) technique to study the influence of heterogeneity and uncertainties in model inputs on zero order radiative transfer (ZRT) model and to quantify interactions between parameters. GSA technique is based on decomposition of variance and can handle nonlinear and nonmonotonic functions. We direct our analyses toward growing agricultural fields of corn and soybean in two different regions, Iowa, USA (SMEX02) and Winnipeg, Canada (SMAPVEX12). We noticed that, there exists a spatio-temporal variation in parameter interactions under different soil moisture and vegetation conditions. Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) behaves more non-linearly in SMEX02 and linearly in SMAPVEX12, with average parameter interactions of 14% in SMEX02 and 5% in SMAPVEX12. Also, parameter interactions increased with vegetation water content (VWC) and roughness conditions. Interestingly, soil moisture shows an exponentially decreasing sensitivity function whereas parameters such as root mean square height (RMS height) and vegetation water content show increasing sensitivity with 0.05 v/v increase in soil moisture range. Overall, considering the SMAPVEX12 fields to be water rich environment (due to higher observed SM) and SMEX02 fields to be energy rich environment (due to lower SM and wide ranges of TSURF), our results indicate that first order as well as interactions between the parameters change with water and energy rich environments.\n",

However, in practice, we suspect that changing climatic conditions may affect runoff generation processes and cause changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship. In this article, we investigate whether temporary but prolonged (i.e., of the order of a decade) shifts in rainfall result in changes in rainfall-runoff relationships at the catchment scale. Annual rainfall and runoff records from south-eastern Australia are used to examine whether interdecadal climate variability induces changes in hydrological behavior. We test statistically whether annual rainfall-runoff relationships are significantly different during extended dry periods, compared with the historical norm. The results demonstrate that protracted drought led to a significant shift in the rainfall-runoff relationship in \u223c44% of the catchment-dry periods studied. The shift led to less annual runoff for a given annual rainfall, compared with the historical relationship. We explore linkages between cases where statistically significant changes occurred and potential explanatory factors, including catchment properties and characteristics of the dry period (e.g., length, precipitation anomalies). We find that long-term drought is more likely to affect transformation of rainfall to runoff in drier, flatter, and less forested catchments. Understanding changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship is important for accurate streamflow projections and to help develop adaptation strategies to deal with multiyear droughts.\n",

The International Association of Hydrological Sciences completed its science decade on Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) in 2012 (Hrachowitz et al., ). Prediction on the basis of limited data is a challenge in hydrology, but not less so in estuaries, where data on fundamental processes are often lacking. In this paper, relatively simple, but science-based, methods are presented that allow researchers, engineers, and water managers to obtain first-order estimates of essential process parameters in estuaries, such as the estuary depth, the tidal amplitude, the tidal excursion, the phase lag, and the salt water intrusion, on the basis of readily obtainable information, such as topographical maps and tidal tables. These apparently simple relationships are assumed to result from the capacity of freely erodible water bodies to adjust themselves to external drivers and to dissipate the free energy from these drivers as efficiently as possible. Thus, it is assumed that these systems operate close to their thermodynamic limit, resulting in predictable patterns that can be described by relatively simple equations. Although still much has to be done to develop an overall physics-based theory, this does not prevent us from making use of the empirical \u201claws\u201d that we observe in alluvial estuaries.\n",

In south Florida, vegetation resistance affects discharge through shallow wetlands of the Everglades and projects under way in the system to restore remaining natural systems. A more detailed knowledge of the flow dynamics in these wetlands is required to improve modeling of these systems that supports restoration and management efforts. The goal of this investigation is to understand the flow dynamics and the vegetation resistance within a 3 km by 7 km area in the Everglades referred to as STA-3/4 Cell 3A. Methods are developed to demonstrate the use of analytical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse methods to obtain bulk and spatially varying resistance parameters. To achieve this goal, a field test was conducted using sinusoidal discharge disturbances capable of creating water waves in the storm water treatment area (STAs). The discharges, wave speeds, and the wave attenuation rates from the test are used to develop graphical and empirical functions expressing discharge in terms of water depth and energy slope. The empirical functions developed are power law type, and different functions are developed for different depths. The results show that the Manning's equation is not applicable for wetlands with thick emergent vegetation, as well as the difficulty of applying a single power law-type expression for vegetation resistance over a wide range of depths and energy slopes without errors. This is partly due to the existence of multiple flow regimes and different power exponents over depth and energy slopes in these regimes. Results show that the flow regime at low depths is similar to porous media flow, and the flow regime at higher depths is more turbulent.\n",

Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation.

However, concerns have arisen that reservoir stimulation creates significant environmental threats through the creation of permeable pathways connecting the stimulated reservoir with shallower freshwater aquifers, thus resulting in the contamination of potable groundwater by escaping hydrocarbons or other reservoir fluids. This study investigates, by numerical simulation, gas and water transport between a shallow tight-gas reservoir and a shallower overlying freshwater aquifer following hydraulic fracturing operations, if such a connecting pathway has been created. We focus on two general failure scenarios: (1) communication between the reservoir and aquifer via a connecting fracture or fault and (2) communication via a deteriorated, preexisting nearby well. We conclude that the key factors driving short-term transport of gas include high permeability for the connecting pathway and the overall volume of the connecting feature. Production from the reservoir is likely to mitigate release through reduction of available free gas and lowering of reservoir pressure, and not producing may increase the potential for release. We also find that hydrostatic tight-gas reservoirs are unlikely to act as a continuing source of migrating gas, as gas contained within the newly formed hydraulic fracture is the primary source for potential contamination. Such incidents of gas escape are likely to be limited in duration and scope for hydrostatic reservoirs. Reliable field and laboratory data must be acquired to constrain the factors and determine the likelihood of these outcomes.\n",

Results indicate that scaling factors from six LSMs, including GLDAS-1 four models (Noah2.7, Mosaic, VIC, and CLM 2.0), CLM 4.0, and WGHM, are similar over most of humid, subhumid, and high-latitude regions but can differ by up to 100% over arid and semiarid basins and areas with intensive irrigation. Temporal variability in scaling factors is generally minor at the basin scale except in arid and semiarid regions, but can be appreciable at the 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid scale. Large differences in TWS anomalies from three processing approaches (scaling factor, additive, and multiplicative corrections) were found in arid and semiarid regions, areas with intensive irrigation, and relatively small basins (e.g., \u2264200,000 km2). Furthermore, TWS anomaly products from gridded data with CLM4.0 scaling factors and the additive correction approach more closely agree with WGHM output than the multiplicative correction approach.

Using the semianalytical solution, we determine scaling relations for the steady rate of dissolution that follow either \nJst\u223cPe\u2009R or \nJst\u223cPe depending on the value of Pe/R, where R represents the ratio of the extent of CO2 plume to the aquifer thickness and Pe is the P\u00e9clet number. Using direct numerical simulations, we provide detailed behavior of the convective mixing during the dissolution. We establish the criteria for forced and mixed (combined free and forced) convection in aquifers that is governed by the background flow. Accordingly, we provide the scaling relations \nJst\u223cPe\u2009R and \nJst\u223cRa\u2009R representing the forced and free convection asymptotes, respectively, where Ra is a Rayleigh number based on aquifer thickness. The results reveal that the background velocity can delay the onset of free convection and can alter the subsequent mixing. This phenomenon is more profound in the systems subject to strong background flows wherein horizontal component of the velocity field generated by background flow hinders the establishments of vertical component of the velocity field. Finally, by applying the proposed relations to several potential storage sites, we demonstrate the screening process in finding aquifers where the background flow exerts an important influence on the dissolution.\n",

Recent developments have explored the effect of viscosity contrast on mixing, suggesting that the unstable displacement of fluids with different viscosities, or viscous fingering, provides a powerful mechanism to increase fluid-fluid interfacial area and enhance mixing. However, existing studies have not incorporated the effect of medium heterogeneity on the mixing rate. Here, we characterize the evolution of mixing between two fluids of different viscosity in heterogeneous porous media. We focus on a practical scenario of divergent-convergent flow in a quarter five spot geometry prototypical of well-driven groundwater flows. We study by means of numerical simulations the impact of permeability heterogeneity and viscosity contrast on the breakthrough curves and mixing efficiency, and we rationalize the nontrivial mixing behavior that emerges from the competition between the creation of fluid-fluid interfacial area and channeling.\n",

Here we report research incorporating fine-scale grid resolutions into the NCAR Community Land Model (CLM v4.0) for simulations at 1, 25, and 100 km resolution using 1 km soil and topographic information. Multiyear model runs were performed over the Southwestern U.S., including the entire state of California and the Colorado River basin. The results show changes in the total amount of CLM-modeled water storage, and changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of water in snow and soil reservoirs, as well as changes in surface fluxes and the energy balance. To inform future model progress and continued development needs and weaknesses, we compare simulation outputs to station and gridded observations of model fields. Although the higher grid-resolution model is not driven by high-resolution forcing, grid resolution changes alone yield significant improvement (reduction in error) between model outputs and observations, where the RMSE decreases by more than 35%, 36%, 34%, and 12% for soil moisture, terrestrial water storage anomaly, sensible heat, and snow water equivalent, respectively. As an additional exercise, we performed a 100 m resolution simulation over a spatial subdomain. Those results indicate that parameters such as drainage, runoff, and infiltration are significantly impacted when hillslope scales of \u223c100 m or finer are considered, and we show the ways in which limitations of the current model physics, including no lateral flow between grid cells, may affect model simulation accuracy.\n",

In the present study, patterns of rainfall are analyzed over the African continent based on 3 hourly 0.25\u00b0 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimates between 1998 and 2012 to produce monthly statistical summaries. The selected rain event properties are multiyear means of precipitation total amount (mm), event frequency (number), rate (mm/h), and duration (h) calculated independently for each calendar month. Analysis of 3 hourly and daily events in the 1998\u20132012 period suggests that rainfall amount can be summarized using gamma probability density functions. Assuming stationarity, gamma probability density functions of the total depth of 3 hourly and daily events are estimated and then used for temporal downscaling of monthly rainfall estimates (past or future). As a result, we generate 3 hourly and daily rainfall estimates that are pixelwise statistically indistinguishable from the observations while preserving monthly totals. Example scripts are provided that can be used to access monthly statistics and implement downscaling using archival (or projected) monthly rainfall estimates. These statistics could also be utilized for the assessment of rainfall from atmospheric models.\n",

In this study, we coupled a stream model with a terrestrial ecohydrological model and conducted a global sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of both ecosystems to nitrogen export. We constructed two scenarios (\u201cnormal\u201d and high nitrate loads) to explore conditions under which terrestrial (lateral nitrate flux) or aquatic ecosystems (instream nutrient processes) may be more important in controlling DIN export. In a forest catchment, although the forest ecosystem controls the nitrogen load to streams, sensitivity results suggested that most nitrogen output from the terrestrial ecosystem was taken up by instream microbial immobilization associated with benthic detritus and retained in detritus. Later the immobilized nitrogen was remineralized as DIN. Therefore, the intra-annual pattern of DIN concentration in the stream was low in fall and became high in spring. Not only was instream microbial immobilization saturated with the high nitrogen load scenario, but also the net effect of immobilization and mineralization on DIN export was minimized because nitrogen cycling between organic and inorganic forms was accelerated. Overall, our linked terrestrial-aquatic model simulations demonstrated that stream process could significantly affect the amount and timing of watershed nitrogen export when nitrogen export from the terrestrial system is low. However, when nitrogen export from the terrestrial system is high, the effect of stream processes is minimal.\n",

Recent studies have highlighted the role of the dendritic structure of river networks in controlling population dynamics of the species they host and large-scale biodiversity patterns. Here, we systematically investigate the relation between energy dissipation, the physical driver for the evolution of river networks, and the ecological dynamics of their embedded biota. To that end, we use the concept of metapopulation capacity, a measure to link landscape structures with the population dynamics they host. Technically, metapopulation capacity is the leading eigenvalue \u03bbM of an appropriate \u201clandscape\u201d matrix subsuming whether a given species is predicted to persist in the long run. \u03bbM can conveniently be used to rank different landscapes in terms of their capacity to support viable metapopulations. We study how \u03bbM changes in response to the evolving network configurations of spanning trees. Such sequence of configurations is theoretically known to relate network selection to general landscape evolution equations through imperfect searches for dynamically accessible states frustrated by the vagaries of Nature. Results show that the process shaping the metric and the topological properties of river networks, prescribed by physical constraints, leads to a progressive increase in the corresponding metapopulation capacity and therefore on the landscape capacity to support metapopulations\u2014with implications on biodiversity in fluvial ecosystems.\n",

For the most part, these models are built on similar principles. The greatest differences are found in how each model parameterizes individual processes (e.g., surface albedo and snow compaction). Parameterization choices naturally span a wide range of complexities. In this study, we evaluate the performance of different snow model parameterizations for hydrological applications using an existing multimodel energy-balance framework and data from two well-instrumented alpine sites with seasonal snow cover. We also include two temperature-index snow models and an intensive, physically based multilayer snow model in our analyses. Our results show that snow mass observations provide useful information for evaluating the ability of a model to predict snowpack runoff, whereas snow depth data alone are not. For snow mass and runoff, the energy-balance models appear transferable between our two study sites, a behavior which is not observed for snow surface temperature predictions due to site-specificity of turbulent heat transfer formulations. Errors in the input and validation data, rather than model formulation, seem to be the greatest factor affecting model performance. The three model types provide similar ability to reproduce daily observed snowpack runoff when appropriate model structures are chosen. Model complexity was not a determinant for predicting daily snowpack mass and runoff reliably. Our study shows the usefulness of the multimodel framework for identifying appropriate models under given constraints such as data availability, properties of interest and computational cost.\n",

Sediment composition and hydrograph flow magnitude greatly influenced channel morphology, which impacted sediment yield, hysteresis, and transport predictions. Bed load yields were larger and more variable for the sand/silt mixture, as gravel in the sand/gravel sediment inhibited grain entrainment, limited bed form growth, and acted to stabilize the bed. Hysteresis patterns varied due to bed form and surface structure adjustments, as well as the stabilizing effect of antecedent low flows. Using half the data set, a dimensionless fractional transport equation was derived based on excess shear stress. Dimensionless reference shear stresses were estimated in two ways: as bulk values from all transport measurements and by applying a separate limb approach in which values were estimated for each limb of each hydrograph. For the other half of the data set, transport predictions with the separate limb approach were more accurate than those from six existing transport equations and the fractional relationship applied with bulk reference shear stresses. Thus, hydrograph limb-dependent dimensionless reference shear stress links changing bed morphology and sediment transport, providing a parameter to improve transport predictions during individual flood events and in unsteady flow regimes. This approach represents a framework with which to develop site-specific transport relationships for varying flow regimes, particularly in cases where detailed bed morphology measurements are not feasible and heterogeneous sediment complicates bed structure over time.\n",

For this purpose, two locations of the Peruvian Amazon River were selected: (1) a site with a medium to high-sinuosity main channel (MS site: Muyuy, Peru) and (2) a site with a low-sinuosity main channel (LS site: at the triple boundary between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru). The main channels for both the MS and LS anabranching structures have freedom to migrate in the lateral direction, while at least one of their secondary channels is adjacent to the geological valley. For MS and LS sites, temporal analysis of planform evolution was carried out using 30 years of satellite imagery from which metrics such as width, sinuosity, and annual maximum migration rates of main and secondary channels were calculated. Additionally, detailed hydrodynamic and bed morphology field measurements were carried out, and a two-dimensional shallow water numerical model was developed. For a medium to high-sinuosity main channel anabranching structure, the secondary channels present a dominant mechanism for reworking the floodplain, while for the low-sinuosity anabranching structure, the main channel planform dynamics is dominant. Flow velocities along the main and secondary channels for low, transition, and high-flow discharges describe that for MS (LS) site, the velocities are much higher along the secondary (main) channels.\n",

Groundwater temperatures may be measured along the cables with high spatial and temporal resolution using a Distributed Temperature Sensing system. The cables may be inserted up to depths of tens of meters in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers. The main advantages of the method are that the cables are in direct contact with the aquifer material, the disturbance of the aquifer is minor, and no borehole is needed. This cost-effective approach may be applied to both passive and active heat tracer experiments. An active heat tracer experiment was conducted to estimate horizontal groundwater velocities in a managed aquifer recharge system in the Netherlands. Six fiber optic cables and a separate heating cable were inserted with a 1 m spacing at the surface. The heating cable was turned on for 4 days and temperatures were measured during both heating and cooling of the aquifer. Temperature measurements at the heating cable alone were used to estimate the magnitude of the groundwater velocity and the thermal conductivity of the solids. The direction of the velocity and heat capacity of the solids were estimated by including temperature measurements at the other fiber optic cables in the analysis. The latter analysis suffered from the fact that the cables were not inserted exactly vertical. The three-dimensional position of the fiber optic cables must be measured for future active heat tracer experiments.\n",

The relevance of the study lies in the direct and indirect measures of the ways in which hydrologic fluxes, in this case, evapotranspiration from the upper surface and discharge from the bottom drainage, sample water and solutes in storage at different times under variable hydrologic forcings. Methods involve the accurate control of hydrologic inputs and outputs and a large number of suitable chemical analyses of water samples in discharge waters. Mass extraction from biomass has also been performed ex post. The results of the 2 year long experiment established that our initial premises on the tracers\u2019 behavior, known to be sorption-free under saturated conditions which we verified in column leaching tests, were unsuitable as large differences in mass recovery appeared. Issues on reactivity thus arose and were addressed in the paper, in this case attributed to microbial degradation and solute plant uptake. Our results suggest previously unknown features of fluorobenzoate compounds as hydrologic tracers, potentially interesting for catchment studies owing to their suitability for distinguishable multiple injections, and an outlook on direct experimental closures of mass balance in hydrologic transport volumes involving fluxes that are likely to sample differently stored water and solutes.\n",

The data refer to the hydrologic transport in a large lysimeter of different fluorobenzoic acids seen as tracers. Export of solute is modeled through a recently developed framework which accounts for nonstationary travel time distributions where we parameterize how output fluxes (namely, discharge and evapotranspiration) sample the available water ages in storage. The relevance of this work lies in the study of hydrologic drivers of the nonstationary character of residence and travel time distributions, whose definition and computation shape this theoretical transport study. Our results show that a large fraction of the different behaviors exhibited by the tracers may be charged to the variability of the hydrologic forcings experienced after the injection. Moreover, the results highlight the crucial, and often overlooked, role of evapotranspiration and plant uptake in determining the transport of water and solutes. This application also suggests that the ways evapotranspiration selects water with different ages in storage can be inferred through model calibration contrasting only tracer concentrations in the discharge.

We have conducted decane-water and nitrogen-water two-phase flow experiments and simulations on real variable-aperture fractures in rocks under confining stress. Experiments have been conducted on fractures for different combinations of rock type (granite or limestone), wettability (contact angle of water: 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0), and intrinsic fracture permeability (10\u221211 m2 or 10\u221210 m2) using different combinations of shear displacement (0 or 1 mm) and effective confining stress (1 or 40 MPa). It has been demonstrated that nonwetting phase relative permeability depends on capillary pressure, except at either a higher contact angle or higher intrinsic permeability (i.e., bigger aperture), where no influence of capillarity is expected from the Young-Laplace equation. In the absence of an influence of capillarity, relations between wetting and nonwetting phase relative permeabilities agree with that of the X-type relative permeability curves. In order to determine the relative permeability curves under the influence of capillarity, the experimental results have been analyzed by two-phase flow simulations of the aperture distributions of the fractures. It has been revealed that nonwetting phase relative permeability becomes zero, even at a small wetting phase saturation of approximately 0.3, while wetting phase relative permeability exhibits Corey-type behavior, resulting in \u03bd-shaped relative permeability curves. Similar curves have been reported in the literature, but have not been demonstrated for real fractures.

These two modeling tasks are handled separately because model selection aims at identifying the most appropriate model with respect to a given calibration data set, while predictive reliability aims at reducing uncertainty in model predictions through constraining the plausible range of both models and model parameters. For that purpose, we pursue an optimal design of measurement framework that is based on BMA and that considers uncertainty in parameters, measurements, and model structures. We apply this framework to select between four crop models (the vegetation components of CERES, SUCROS, GECROS, and SPASS), which are coupled to identical routines for simulating soil carbon and nitrogen turnover, soil heat and nitrogen transport, and soil water movement. An ensemble of parameter realizations was generated for each model using Monte-Carlo simulation. We assess each model's plausibility by determining its posterior weight, which signifies the probability to have generated a given experimental data set. Several BMA analyses were conducted for different data packages with measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ETa), and leaf area index (LAI). The posterior weights resulting from the different BMA runs were compared to the weight distribution of a reference run with all data types to investigate the utility of different data packages and monitoring design options in identifying the most appropriate model in the ensemble. We found that different (combinations of) data types support different models and none of the four crop models outperforms all others under all data scenarios. The best model discrimination was observed for those data where the competing models disagree the most. The data worth for reducing prediction uncertainty depends on the prediction to be made. LAI data have the highest utility for predicting ETa, while soil moisture data are better for predicting soil water drainage. Our study illustrates, that BMA provides an objective framework for data worth analysis with respect to both model discrimination and model calibration for a wide range of applications.\n",

The objective of this study is to understand how well Coupled Model Intercomparison-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations replicate ground-based observations of continental drought areas and their trends. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble encompasses the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) ground-based observations of area under drought at all time steps. However, most model members overestimate the areas under extreme drought, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Furthermore, the results show that the time series of observations and CMIP5 simulations of areas under drought exhibit more variability in the SH than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The trend analysis of areas under drought reveals that the observational data exhibit a significant positive trend at the significance level of 0.05 over all land areas. The observed trend is reproduced by about three-fourths of the CMIP5 models when considering total land areas in drought. While models are generally consistent with observations at a global (or hemispheric) scale, most models do not agree with observed regional drying and wetting trends. Over many regions, at most 40% of the CMIP5 models are in agreement with the trends of CRU observations. The drying/wetting trends calculated using the 3 months Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values show better agreement with the corresponding CRU values than with the observed annual mean precipitation rates. Pixel-scale evaluation of CMIP5 models indicates that no single model demonstrates an overall superior performance relative to the other models.\n",

        "description": "\n\nRemote sensing could enable high-resolution mapping of long river segments, but realizing this potential will require new methods for inferring channel bathymetry from passive optical image data without using field measurements for calibration. As an alternative to regression-based approaches, this study introduces a novel framework for Flow REsistance Equation-Based Imaging of River Depths (FREEBIRD). This technique allows for depth retrieval in the absence of field data by linking a linear relation between an image-derived quantity X and depth d to basic equations of open channel flow: continuity and flow resistance. One FREEBIRD algorithm takes as input an estimate of the channel aspect (width/depth) ratio A and a series of cross-sections extracted from the image and returns the coefficients of the X versus d relation. A second algorithm calibrates this relation so as to match a known discharge Q. As an initial test of FREEBIRD, these procedures were applied to panchromatic satellite imagery and publicly available aerial photography of a clear-flowing gravel-bed river. Accuracy assessment based on independent field surveys indicated that depth retrieval performance was comparable to that achieved by direct, field-based calibration methods. Sensitivity analyses suggested that FREEBIRD output was not heavily influenced by misspecification of A or Q, or by selection of other input parameters. By eliminating the need for simultaneous field data collection, these methods create new possibilities for large-scale river monitoring and analysis of channel change, subject to the important caveat that the underlying relationship between X and d must be reasonably strong.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe two-phase flow characterization (CO2/water) of a Triassic sandstone core from the Paris Basin, France, is reported in this paper. Absolute properties (porosity and water permeability), capillary pressure, relative permeability with hysteresis between drainage and imbibition, and residual trapping capacities have been assessed at 9 MPa pore pressure and 28\u00b0C (CO2 in liquid state) using a single core-flooding apparatus associated with magnetic resonance imaging. Different methodologies have been followed to obtain a data set of flow properties to be upscaled and used in large-scale CO2 geological storage evolution modeling tools. The measurements are consistent with the properties of well-sorted water-wet porous systems. As the mineralogical investigations showed a nonnegligible proportion of carbonates in the core, the experimental protocol was designed to observe potential impacts on flow properties of mineralogical changes. The magnetic resonance scanning and mineralogical observations indicate mineral dissolution during the experimental campaign, and the core-flooding results show an increase in porosity and water absolute permeability. The changes in two-phase flow properties appear coherent with the pore structure modifications induced by the carbonates dissolution but the changes in relative permeability could also be explained by a potential increase of the water-wet character of the core. Further investigations on the impacts of mineral changes are required with other reactive formation rocks, especially carbonate-rich ones, because the implications can be significant both for the validity of laboratory measurements and for the outcomes of in situ operations modeling.\n",

        "description": "\n\nVegetation is a common feature in natural coastal and riverine water ways, interacting with both the water flow and sediment transport. However, the physical processes governing these interactions are still poorly understood, which makes it difficult to predict sediment transport and morphodynamics in a vegetated environment. We performed a simple experiment to study how sediment transport responds to the presence of flexible, single-blade vegetation, and how this response is influenced by the vegetation density. We found that the skin friction and sediment transport are reduced in a plant patch, and that this effect is larger for denser vegetation. We then evaluated several methods to calculate the skin friction in a vegetated flow, which is the key to sediment transport prediction. Among these, the inversion of bed load transport formulas and the Einstein and Banks (1950) methods appeared to produce the most reasonable values of the skin friction. Finally, we suggest using the parameter \u03b1, which is the ratio of the skin friction computed by these methods to the total bed shear stress, to make more realistic sediment transport predictions in morphodynamic models.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe hyporheic zone is often a critical component of river systems. Hyporheic exchange is generally forced by variation in riverbed topography such as due to bed forms. Most previous research on bed form-driven hyporheic flow has focused on two-dimensional (2-D) dunes and ripples, while little has been done on their three-dimensional (3-D) counterparts. Here we compared hyporheic exchange and associated metrics for a previously studied pair of corresponding 2-D and 3-D bed forms. To accomplish this, a series of multiphysics computational fluid dynamics models were conducted both in 2-D and 3-D with similar open channel Reynolds numbers (Re). Results show that the pressure gradient along the sediment-water interface is highly sensitive to the spatial structure of bed forms, which consequently determines hyporheic flow dynamics. Hyporheic flux is a function of Re for both 2-D and 3-D dunes via a power law; however, the equivalent 3-D dunes have a higher flux since the 3-D form induces more drag. The hyporheic zone depths and volumes are only slightly different with the 3-D case having a larger volume. The mean fluid residence times for both cases are related to Re by an inverse power law relationship, with the 3-D dune having smaller residence times at moderate to high Re. The effects of increasing flux on residence time in 3-D dunes are partly modulated by a slightly increasing hyporheic volume. Our results suggest that a 2-D idealization is a reasonable approximation for the more complex 3-D situation if local details are unimportant but that development of predictive models for mean fluxes and residence times, which are critical for biogeochemical processes, based on 2-D models may be insufficient.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWhile most landscapes respond to extreme rainfalls with increased surface water outflows, very flat and poorly drained ones have little capacity to do this and their most common responses include (i) increased water storage leading to rising water tables and floods, (ii) increased evaporative water losses, and, after reaching high levels of storage, (iii) increased liquid water outflows. The relative importance of these pathways was explored in the extensive plains of the Argentine Pampas, where two significant flood episodes (denoted FE1 and FE2) occurred in 2000\u20132003 and 2012\u20132013. In two of the most flood-prone areas (Western and Lower Pampa, 60,000 km2 each), surface water cover reached 31 and 19% during FE1 in each subregion, while FE2 covered up to 22 and 10%, respectively. From the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the flood events, we distinguished slow floods lasting several years when the water table is brought to the surface following sustained precipitation excesses in groundwater-connected systems (Western Pampa), and \u201cfast\u201d floods triggered by surface water accumulation over the course of weeks to months, typical of poor surface-groundwater connectivity (Lower Pampa) or when exceptionally strong rainfalls overwhelm infiltration capacity. Because of these different hydrological responses, precipitation and evapotranspiration were strongly linked in the Lower Pampa only, while the connection between water fluxes and storage was limited to the Western Pampa. In both regions, evapotranspirative losses were strongly linked to flooded conditions as a regulatory feedback, while liquid water outflows remained negligible.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA novel method of estimating evapotranspiration (ET), referred to as the ETRHEQ method, is further developed, validated, and applied across the U.S. from 1961 to 2010. The ETRHEQ method estimates the surface conductance to water vapor transport, which is the key rate-limiting parameter of typical ET models, by choosing the surface conductance that minimizes the vertical variance of the calculated relative humidity profile averaged over the day. The ETRHEQ method, which was previously tested at five AmeriFlux sites, is modified for use at common weather stations and further validated at 20 AmeriFlux sites that span a wide range of climates and limiting factors. Averaged across all sites, the daily latent heat flux RMSE is \u223c26 W\u00b7m\u22122 (or 15%). The method is applied across the U.S. at 305 weather stations and spatially interpolated using ANUSPLIN software. Gridded annual mean ETRHEQ ET estimates are compared with four data sets, including water balance-derived ET, machine-learning ET estimates based on FLUXNET data, North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase 2 ET, and a benchmark product that integrates 14 global ET data sets, with RMSEs ranging from 8.7 to 12.5 cm\u00b7yr\u22121. The ETRHEQ method relies only on data measured at weather stations, an estimate of vegetation height derived from land cover maps, and an estimate of soil thermal inertia. These data requirements allow it to have greater spatial coverage than direct measurements, greater historical coverage than satellite methods, significantly less parameter specification than most land surface models, and no requirement for calibration.\n",

In areas with low-density rain gage networks, or where these networks are nonexistent, satellite rainfall measurements can also provide useful estimates to be used as virtual rain gages. However, satellite and rain gage measurements are statistically different in nature and cannot be directly compared to one another. In the present paper, we develop a methodology to downscale satellite rainfall measurements to generate rain-gage-equivalent statistics. We apply the methodology to four locations along a strong rainfall gradient in the Kalahari transect, southern Africa, to validate the methodology. We show that the method allows the estimation of point rainfall statistics where only satellite measurements exist. Point rainfall statistics are key descriptors for ecohydrologic studies linking the response of vegetation to rainfall dynamics.\n",

In case of a nonreactive or linearly sorbing solute, mixing is in complete analogy with classical dispersion theory. For nonlinear exchange, however, oscillating convective flow leads to an alternation of sharpening (Traveling Wave TW) and spreading (Rarefaction Wave RW). As the limiting TW form is not necessarily accomplished at the end of the TW half cycle, the oscillating fronts show gradual continuous spreading that converges to a zero-convection nonlinear pure diffusion spreading, which is mathematically of quite different nature. This behavior is maintained in case the total (background) concentration differs at both sides of the initial exchange front.\n",

This paper presents a theoretical method for evaluating the measurement sensitivity and an improved design of the TDR penetrometer. The sensitivity evaluation method is based on a spatial weighting analysis of the electromagnetic field using a seepage analysis software. This method is used to quantify the measurement sensitivity for the three types of TDR penetrometers reported in literature as well as guide the design improvement of the TDR penetrometer. The improved design includes the use of semicircle-shaped conductors and the optimization of the conductor diameter. The measurement sensitivity to the targeted medium for the improved TDR penetrometer is evaluated to be greater than those of the three types of TDR penetrometers reported in literature. The performance of the improved TDR penetrometer was demonstrated by conducting an experimental calibration of the probe and penetration tests in a chamber containing a silty soil column. The experimental results demonstrate that the measurements from the improved TDR penetrometer are able to capture the variation in the water content profiles as well as the leachate contaminated soil.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe paper forms part of the search for a thermodynamic explanation for the empirical Budyko Curve, addressing a long-standing research question in hydrology. Here this issue is pursued by invoking the Proportionality Hypothesis underpinning the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method widely used for estimating direct runoff at the event scale. In this case, the Proportionality Hypothesis posits that the ratio of continuing abstraction to its potential value is equal to the ratio of direct runoff to its potential value. Recently, the validity of the Proportionality Hypothesis has been extended to the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evaporation at the annual time scale as well. In this case, the Proportionality Hypothesis dictates that the ratio of continuing evaporation to its potential value is equal to the ratio of runoff to its potential value. The Budyko Curve could then be seen as the straightforward outcome of the application of the Proportionality Hypothesis to estimate mean annual water balance. In this paper, we go further and demonstrate that the Proportionality Hypothesis itself can be seen as a result of the application of the thermodynamic principle of Maximum Entropy Production (MEP). In this way, we demonstrate a possible thermodynamic basis for the Proportionality Hypothesis, and consequently for the Budyko Curve. As a further extension, the L'vovich formulation for the two-stage partitioning of annual precipitation is also demonstrated to be a result of MEP: one for the competition between soil wetting and fast flow during the first stage; another for the competition between evaporation and base flow during the second stage.\n",

A previously developed two-color microscopic particle image velocimetry approach is combined with a high-pressure apparatus, facilitating flow quantification of water interacting with supercritical CO2. This technique simultaneously resolves (in space and time) the aqueous phase velocity field as well as the dynamics of the menisci. The method and the experimental apparatus are detailed, and the results are presented to demonstrate its unique capabilities for studying pore-scale dynamics of CO2-water interactions. Simultaneous identification of the boundary between the two fluid phases and quantification of the instantaneous velocity field in the aqueous phase provides a step change in capability for investigating multiphase flow physics at the pore scale at reservoir-relevant conditions.\n",
