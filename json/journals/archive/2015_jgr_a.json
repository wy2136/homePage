        "description": "\n\nA new approach for quantitatively detecting volcanic ash and dust from satellite has been developed. The Spectrally Enhanced Cloud Objects (SECO) algorithm utilizes a combination of radiative transfer theory, a statistical model, and image processing techniques to identify volcanic ash and dust clouds in satellite imagery with a very low false alarm rate. This fully automated technique is globally applicable (day and night) and can be adapted to a wide range of low earth orbit and geostationary satellite sensors or even combinations of satellite sensors. The SECO algorithm consists of four primary components: conversion of satellite measurements into robust spectral metrics, application of a Bayesian method to estimate the probability that a given satellite pixel contains volcanic ash and/or dust, construction of cloud objects, and the selection of cloud objects deemed to have the physical attributes consistent with volcanic ash and/or dust clouds. The first two components of the SECO algorithm were described in Part I of this study. The final two components are described in this paper. In addition, case studies and a global analysis are utilized to illustrate the benefits of the SECO approach relative to the traditional \u201csplit-window\u201d ash/dust detection technique. The SECO algorithm can form the basis for more advanced applications such as volcanic cloud alerting and data assimilation.",

        "description": "\n\nRadiosonde-based tropical expansion rate estimates for six continental-centred regions of the globe are discussed. New results from the Northern Hemisphere are presented, complementing previous Southern Hemisphere (SH) results using an identical methodology. Expansion rates are largest over Asia and Australia-New Zealand (ANZ). Other regions show more modest rates of expansion, and there is no statistically significant expansion over North America. In the hemispheric average, expansion rates are slightly larger in the SH. This asymmetry, although not statistically significant, is consistent with ozone depletion acting as a co-driver of tropical expansion since 1979. The picture of regional expansion here is different from that in other studies or that derived solely from reanalyses. The relationships between tropical expansion and modes of climate variability are explored using partial regression techniques. Interannually, a relationship is seen with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) across most of the globe. Regionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has a significant impact over Asia while the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) affects expansion over ANZ. Considering the longer-term changes in the climate variability indices since 1979, suggests that the PDO may account for up to 50% of the observed tropical expansion over Asia, while SAM may account for 20-30% of the SH expansion, particularly over ANZ. Decadal changes in ENSO may account for a further 20-30% of the global and regional trends. Accounting for the effect of climate variability helps to reconcile the differences in observations and model-based simulations of tropical expansion.",

However, the inconsistency between the real-time satellite precipitation and gauge-based retrospective data may introduce large systematic bias in near-real-time hydrological monitoring. Here we attempted to integrate the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) real-time precipitation (3B42RTV7) into a 62-year gauge-based retrospective product (IGSNRR) through matching their cumulative probability functions (CDFs) towards a near-real-time hydrological monitoring consistent with the long-term retrospective simulations. A nearly 11-year period from March 2000 to December 2010 was taken as the training period to establish the satellite-gauge precipitation relationship, which was employed in the period of 2011\u20132013 to evaluate the performance of the adjustment. The results show that the adjusted 3B42RTV7 matches well with IGSNRR precipitation while the unadjusted data tends to overestimate precipitation. Forced by the adjusted 3B42RTV7, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model can reproduce the IGSNRR-derived hydrographs and high/low flows better than the model forced by the unadjusted data. The percentiles of the adjusted hydrological estimates in the 62-year estimates from IGSNRR are used for near-real-time assessment of hydrological extremes. The hydrological monitoring assisted by the adjusted satellite precipitation, which enables the employment of the long-term ground observations, is able to capture more detailed drought information than that before adjustment. Our experiment suggests the satellite real-time precipitation, after adjustment, can generate the current hydrological conditions which can be directly compared with the long-term climatology, and thus facilitates near-real-time diagnosis and detection of hydrological extremes.",

        "description": "\n\nA database consisting of approximately 4000 storm observations has been objectively analyzed to determine environmental characteristics that produce high radar reflectivities above the freezing level, large total lightning flash rates on the order of 10 flashes min\u22121 and anomalous vertical charge structures (most notably, dominant mid-level positive charge). The storm database is drawn from four regions of the United States featuring distinct environments, each with coinciding Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) network data. LMAs are able to infer total lightning flash rates using flash clustering algorithms, such as the one implemented in this study. Results show that anomalous charge structures inferred from LMA data, significant lightning flash rates and increased radar reflectivities above the freezing level tend to be associated with environments that have high cloud base heights (approximately 3 km above ground level) and large atmospheric instability, quantified by normalized convective available potential energy (NCAPE) near 0.2 m s\u22122. Additionally, we infer that aerosols may affect storm intensity. Maximum flash rates were observed in storms with attributed aerosol concentrations near 1000 cm\u22123 while total flash rates decrease when aerosol concentrations exceed 1500 cm\u22123, consistent with previous studies. However, this effect is more pronounced in regions where the NCAPE and cloud base height are low. The dearth of storms with estimated aerosol concentrations less than 700 cm\u22123 (approximately 1% of total sample) does not provide a complete depiction of aerosol invigoration.",

        "description": "\n\nMethane (CH4) is the primary component of natural gas and has a larger global warming potential than CO2. Recent top-down studies based on observations showed CH4 emissions in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) were greater than those expected from population-apportioned bottom-up state inventories. In this study, we quantify CH4 emissions with an advanced mesoscale inverse modeling system at a resolution of 8 km \u00d7 8 km, using aircraft measurements in the SoCAB during the 2010 CalNex campaign to constrain the inversion. To simulate atmospheric transport, we use the FLEXPART-WRF Lagrangian particle dispersion model driven by three configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model. We determine surface fluxes of CH4 using a Bayesian least squares method in a 4-dimensional inversion. Simulated CH4 concentrations with the posterior emission inventory achieve much better correlations with the measurements (R2=0.7) than using the prior inventory (US EPA's National Emission Inventory 2005, R2=0.5). The emission estimates for CH4 in the posterior, 46.3 \u00b1 9.2 Mg CH4/hr, is consistent with published observation-based estimates. Changes in the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the SoCAB between the prior and posterior inventories are discussed. Missing or underestimated emissions from dairies, the oil/gas system, and landfills in the SoCAB seem to explain the differences between the prior and posterior inventories. We estimate that dairies contributed 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 Mg CH4/hr and the two sectors of oil and gas industry (production and downstream) and landfills together contributed 39.6 \u00b1 8.1 Mg CH4/hr in the SoCAB.",

Overall, a clear decreasing trend occurred over a period of 63 years, with pronounced drying over Northeast China, North China, part of Mongolia, and Russia near Lake Baikal. Statistical analyses show that decreasing precipitation and global warming have different effects on the decrease in soil moisture. The qualitative analysis and quantitative contributions illustrated that soil drying is driven primarily by decreasing precipitation, and is enhanced almost twofold by increasing temperatures. As soil moisture decreases, the positive feedback between soil moisture and temperature may result in future water shortages. Following the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and 4.5 (RCP4.5) simulation scenario of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), the model-predicted soil moisture demonstrated a continuously decreasing trend during the twenty-first century.",

Based on tree-ring \u03b418O from native, dominant Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. et Mey.), we developed a 300-year (1710 to 2010) standard precipitation-evaporation index (SPEI) reconstruction from January to August for China's western Tianshan Mountains. The regression model explained 37.6% of the variation in the SPEI reconstruction during the calibration period from 1950 to 2010. Comparison with previous drought reconstructions confirmed the robustness of our reconstruction. The 20th century has been a relatively wet period during the past 300 years. The SPEI showed quasi 2-, 5-, and 10-year cycles. Several pluvials and droughts with co-variability over large areas were revealed clearly in the reconstruction. The two longest pluvials (lasting for 12 years), separated by 50 years, appeared in the 1900s and the 1960s. The most severe drought occurred from 1739 to 1761, and from 1886 to 1911 was the wettest period since 1710. Compared to previous investigations of hydroclimatic changes in the western Tianshan Mountains, our reconstruction revealed more low-frequency variability and indicated that climate in the western Tianshan Mountains shifted from dry to wet in 1886. This regime shift was generally consistent with other moisture reconstructions for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and northern Pakistan, and may have resulted from a strengthened westerly circulation. The opposite hydrological trends in the western Tianshan Mountains and southeastern Tibetan Plateau reveal a substantial influence of strengthened westerlies and weakening of the Indian summer monsoon.",

A schematic diagram was given to demonstrate the coupled and decoupled MBL vertical structures and how they associate with non-drizzle, virga and rain drizzle events. Out of a total of 2676 5-min samples, 34.5% were classified as coupled and 65.5% as decoupled; 36.2% as non-drizzle and 63.8% as drizzle (47.7% as virga, 16.1% as rain); 33.4% as daytime and 66.6% as nighttime. The decoupled cloud layer is deeper (0.406 km) than coupled cloud layer (0.304 km), and its liquid water path (LWP) and cloud-droplet effective radius (re) values (122.1 gm-2 and 13.0 \u00b5m) are higher than coupled ones (83.7 gm-2 and 10.4 \u00b5m). Conversely, decoupled stratocumuli have lower cloud-droplet number concentration (Nd) and surface cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration (NCCN) (74.5 cm-3 and 150.9 cm-3) than coupled stratocumuli (111.7 cm-3 and 216.4 cm-3). The linear regressions between re and Nd with NCCN have demonstrated that coupled re and Nd strongly depend on NCCN and have higher correlations (-0.56 and 0.59) with NCCN than decoupled results (-0.14 and 0.25). The MBL cloud properties under non-drizzle and virga drizzle conditions are similar to each other, but significantly different to those of rain drizzle.",

Multiple wavelength absorption was measured from fuels including wood, agricultural biomass, coals, plant-matter, and petroleum distillates in controlled combustion settings. Filter based absorption measurements were corrected and compared to photo-acoustic absorption results. BC absorption was segregated from the total light extinction to estimate the BrC absorption from individual sources. Results were compared to EC/OC concentrations to determine composition's impact on light absorption. Multiple wavelength absorption coefficients, Angstrom Exponent (6.9 to <1.0), Mass Absorption Cross-Section (MAC), and Delta-C (97 ug m-3 to ~ 0 ug m-3) were highly variable. Sources such as incense and peat emissions showed ultraviolet wavelength (370 nm) BrC absorption over 175 and 80 times (respectively) the BC absorption, but only 21 and 11 times (respectively) at 520 nm wavelength. The bulk EC MACEC, \u03bb (Ave. at 520 nm = 9.0 \u00b13.7 m2g-1; with OC fraction <0.85 = ~7.5 m2g-1) and the BrC OC mass absorption cross-sections (MACBrC,OC,\u03bb) were calculated and at 370 nm ultraviolet wavelengths, the MACBrC,OC,\u03bb ranged from 0.8 m2g-1 to 2.29 m2g-1 (lowest peat, highest kerosene), while at 520 nm wavelength MACBrC,OC,\u03bb ranged from 0.07 m2g-1 to 0.37 m2g-1 (lowest peat, highest kerosene/incense mixture).

Our results show that the summer SAT variability in Patagonia is highly driven by the intraseasonal activity (~80%), especially by that associated with the MJO. The active MJO phases modulate the spatial mean intraseasonal temperature signal in Eastern Patagonia with ~1.5\u00b0C of amplitude. In most of the region, the warmest (coldest) conditions are found during active phase 8 (4). These opposite states of the temperature perturbations are related to almost inverse mid-level circulation anomalies over southern South America and the southwest Atlantic, which are part of a large-scale Rossby-like wave train of alternating circulation anomalies extended along the South Pacific. The corresponding outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies suggest that these structures may be triggered by anomalous convection in the tropics. Furthermore, we show that intraseasonal heat waves in southeastern Patagonia tend to occur during active MJO phase 8. These events are also induced by a wave train pattern over the South Pacific, associated with other intraseasonal variability sources. Hence, as shown in a case study, circulation anomalies over the South Pacific triggered in general by tropical convection variability and in particular by the MJO activity may constructively interact with circulation patterns resulting from the extratropical dynamics, eventually leading to intraseasonal heat waves in southeastern Patagonia.",

        "description": "\n\nA new research algorithm is presented here as the second part of a two-part study to retrieve aerosol microphysical properties from the multi-spectral and multi-angular photo-polarimetric measurements taken by AERONET's new-generation SunPhotometer. The algorithm uses an advanced UNified and Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM), and incorporates a statistical optimization approach. While the new algorithm has heritage from AEROENT operational inversion algorithm in constraining a priori and retrieval smoothness, it has two new features. First, the new algorithm retrieves the effective radius, effective variance, and total volume of aerosols associated with a continuous bi-modal particle size distribution (PSD) function, while the AERONET operational algorithm retrieves aerosol volume over 22 size bins. Second, our algorithm retrieves complex refractive indices for both fine and coarse modes, while the AERONET operational algorithm assumes a size-independent aerosol refractive index. Mode-resolved refractive indices can improve the estimate of the single scattering albedo (SSA) for each aerosol mode, and thus facilitate the validation of satellite products and chemistry transport models. We applied the algorithm to a suite of real cases over Beijing_RADI site, and found that our retrievals are overall consistent with AERONET operational inversions, but can offer mode-resolved refractive index and SSA with acceptable accuracy for the aerosol composed by spherical particles. Along with the retrieval using both radiance and polarization, we also performed radiance-only retrieval to demonstrate the improvements by adding polarization in the inversion. Contrast analysis indicates that with polarization, retrieval error can be reduced by over 50% in PSD parameters, 10\u201330% in the refractive index, and 10\u201340% in SSA, which is consistent with theoretical analysis presented in the companion paper of this two-part series study.",

Using spatially and temporally collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data sets, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave Aerosol Direct Shortwave Radiative Effects (ARE) of absorbing aerosols above low-level water clouds in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean was examined in this study. The regional averaged instantaneous ARE has been estimated to be 36.7\u00b120.5 Wm\u22122 (regional mean \u00b1 standard deviation) along with a mean positive OMI Aerosol Index (AI) at 1.3 in August 2006 based on multi-sensors measurements. The highest magnitude of instantaneous ARE can even reach 138.2 Wm\u22122. We assess that the 660nm Cloud Optical Depth (COD) values of 8\u201312 is the critical value above (below) which aerosol absorption(scattering) effect dominates and further produces positive (negative) ARE values. The results further show that ARE values are more sensitive to aerosols above lower COD values than cases for higher COD values. This is among the first studies to provide quantitative estimates of shortwave ARE due to AAC events from an observational perspective.",

Pan evaporation in the TRSR has decreased significantly since 1988 with an obvious abrupt change from 1993 to 2003. Furthermore, a 27-year period of oscillation has existed over the past 51 years. Pan evaporation reflects the combined effects of four meteorological variables: net radiation (Rn), wind speed (u2), actual vapor pressure (ea), and air temperature (Ta). Based on this research a number of conclusions were drawn. (1) The pace of climate change increased after 1980 and pan evaporation decreased at a rate of \u221213.3 mm/a2 from 1980 to 2012, which is much faster than the rate of \u22121.2 mm/a2 from 1962 to 1979. (2) For the decrease of pan evaporation from 1980 to 2012, the quantifying contributions of Rn, u2, ea, and Ta were \u22128.7, \u22126.4, \u22121.8, and +3.6 mm/a2, respectively. Thus, it was established for the TRSR that \u201cglobal dimming\u201d was the main reason and \u201cwind stilling\u201d was a close second to \u201cglobal dimming\u201d for the decrease in pan evaporation. (3) Different regions of the TRSR are affected differently by the effects of the meteorological variables. Low-elevation regions in the TRSR are more susceptible to the effects of net radiation and wind speed, whereas high-elevation regions are affected more by actual vapor pressure and air temperature.",

In this study, the long-term wind velocity data observed with the Poker Flat MF radar (65\u00b0N,147\u00b0W) was analyzed for the period of 1999\u20132008 to show local time dependence and seasonal climatologies of the 12-hour and 24-hour components in the mesospheric winds and their modulations of gravity wave kinetic energy. We made climatological 1-day composite plots of the kinetic energy of gravity waves for wave periods of 1\u20134 hours and harmonic components of horizontal wind for each month. The results show that the kinetic energy of gravity waves peaks twice at 3\u20136 LT and 18\u201321 LT, which tend to coincide with the transition of the 12-hour component of zonal wind from westward to eastward flow. On the other hand, a two month case study revealed that the gravity wave kinetic energy and the 12-hour components of zonal wind appear to keep their phase difference constant (like a \" phase locked\" ) for more than 10\u2009days. Events of this kind are also found in other years. To examine whether this relation can be explained by interaction between the 12-hour component of zonal wind and gravity waves, we applied a gravity wave drag model to the background state defined as the sum of observed monthly mean and harmonic components of zonal wind. It is suggested that the orographic gravity wave drag has a 12-hour periodicity and that the time of the drag enhancement changes in time following change in the phase of harmonic components of winds.",

The analysis is performed using ground-based and space-based measurements over the Light detection and ranging (lidar) stations for the period 1985\u20132012. Also, trends are estimated for the zonal mean data made from a merged satellite data set, GOZCARDS (Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere) over 1979\u20132012. The linear trends in stratospheric ozone are estimated using piece-wise linear trend (PWLT) functions. The ozone trends during the increasing phase of halogens (before 1997) range from \u22120.2\u00b10.08 to \u22121\u00b10.07 % year\u22121 in the mid-latitudes and \u22120.2\u00b10.06 to \u22120.7\u00b10.05 % year\u22121 in the subtropics at 15\u201345 km, depending on altitude. In 1997\u20132012, the PWLT analyses show a positive trend, significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence intervals, toward ozone recovery in the middle and low latitude upper stratosphere (35\u201345 km), and the trends are about \u00b10.5\u00b10.07 % year\u22121 at mid-latitudes and about \u00b10.3\u00b10.05 % year\u22121 at subtropical latitudes. However, negative and insignificant trends are estimated in the lower stratosphere (15\u201320 km) over 1997\u20132012 in the mid-latitudes, mainly due to the dynamics, as demonstrated by the large (50\u201360%) contributions from the quasi-biennial oscillation, El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and planetary wave activity to recent ozone changes. This suggests that the ozone changes are governed by the interannual variations in meteorology and dynamics of the regions; these factors will influence the recovery detection time and the behavior of the recovery path to pre-1980 levels.",

Here we show that the zonal means of (1) MODIS-retrieved \u03c4 and Re, and (2) \u03c4 retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) using MODIS-retrieved Re as input, both exhibit a large, local negative bias in the rainbow scattering direction relative to adjacent scattering angles for oceanic water clouds. Using radiative transfer simulations, we demonstrate that these local biases are explained by overestimates in MODIS-retrieved Re. While 3-D factors on the angular variability of \u03c4 are evident, we conclude that a Re bias is itself an important contributor to this variability. With 3-D factors present, we show that upper- and lower-bound estimates on the biases in the three MODIS Re products, namely Re1.6, Re2.1 and Re3.7 retrieved from 1.6-, 2.1-, and 3.7-\u00b5m channels, respectively, are possible from a combination of MISR and MODIS data. The midpoints of the upper and lower bounds in zonal-mean biases are estimated to be 3\u201311 \u00b5m for Re2.1 and Re1.6 and 2\u20137 \u00b5m for Re3.7, depending on latitude, with smaller biases at latitudes where more stratiform clouds contribute to the total low-cloud cover. Removing the bias from the zonal-means reveal that Re1.6, Re2.1, and Re3.7 are more similar with each other compared to their original values. The change in zonal-mean of Re as a function of latitude is also very different between original and bias-corrected products. These differences change the interpretation of the vertical and horizontal distribution of Re from the original MODIS product.",

It provides theoretical analysis and guidance to the companion study in which we have developed an inversion algorithm for retrieving twenty-two aerosol microphysical parameters associated with a bi-modal PSD function from real AERONET measurements. Our theoretical analysis starts with generating the synthetic measurements at four spectral bands (440, 675, 870, and 1020 nm) with a Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM) for various types of spherical aerosol particles. Subsequently, the quantitative information content for retrieving aerosol parameters is investigated in four observation scenarios, i.e., I1, I2, P1, and P2. Measurements in the scenario (I1) comprise the solar direct radiances and almucantar radiances that are used in the current AERONET operational inversion algorithm. The other three scenarios include different additional measurements: (I2) the solar principal-plane radiances, (P1) the solar principal-plane radiances and polarization, and (P2) the solar almucantar polarization. Results indicate that adding polarization measurements can increase the degree of freedom for signal (DFS) by 2\u20135 in the scenario P1, while not as much of an increase is found in the scenarios I2 and P2. Correspondingly, smallest retrieval errors are found in the scenario P1: 2.3% (2.9%) for the fine-mode (coarse-mode) aerosol volume concentration, 1.3% (3.5%) for the effective radius, 7.2% (12%) for the effective variance, 0.005 (0.035) for the real part refractive index, and 0.019 (0.068) for the single scattering albedo. These errors represent a reduction from their counterparts in scenario I1of 79% (57%), 76% (49%), 69% (52%), 66% (46%), and 49% (20%), respectively. We further investigated those retrieval errors over a variety of aerosol loading and fine/coarse-mode prevalence, which indicates that observations in scenario P1 can yield the retrieval of refractive index and single scattering albedo for both fine and coarse aerosol modes, when aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm is larger than 0.2 and 870/1020-nm \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent ranges between 0.7 and 1.6.",

The lightning channel is represented as a transmission line including corona and nonlinear losses. Analyses for the hypothetical case of a lossless channel considering matched tower and channel impedances show that the arrival of current pulses at the upward moving return-stroke front leads to an increase in corona currents leaving the channel. This transient process generates current pulses whose arrival at the tower top can be interpreted as the effect of a current reflection at the upward moving front, even though no impedance discontinuity exists at that point if return-stroke and leader channel properties are assumed the same. In the more realistic case of a lossy channel considering unmatched channel and tower impedances, the nonlinear channel resistance modifies the current pulses that propagate along the channel so that they merge smoothly with the return-stroke front. In this case, the interaction of the current pulses transmitted from the tower to the channel with the upward-moving return-stroke front does not lead to features that can be clearly interpreted as the result of current reflections at that point in the evaluated conditions. Finally, it is argued that the current reflection coefficient at the tower top should be viewed as a current dependent parameter as opposed to a constant, linear value.\n",

Methane and VOCs were measured over the Haynesville and Marcellus shale gas plays onboard the NCAR C-130 and NOAA WP-3D research aircraft in June-July of 2013. We used an eddy covariance technique to measure in situ fluxes of CH4 and benzene from both C-130 flights with high-resolution data (10 Hz) and WP-3D flights with low-resolution data (1 Hz). Correlation (R=0.65) between CH4 and benzene fluxes was observed when flying over shale gas operations and the enhancement ratio of fluxes was consistent with the corresponding concentration observations. Fluxes calculated by the eddy covariance method show agreement with a mass balance approach within their combined uncertainties. In general, CH4 fluxes in the shale gas regions follow a lognormal distribution, with some deviations for relatively large fluxes (>10 \u00b5g m\u22122 s\u22121). Statistical analysis of the fluxes shows that a small number of facilities (i.e. ~10%) are responsible for up to ~40% of the total CH4 emissions in the two regions. We show that the airborne eddy covariance method can also be applied in some circumstances when meteorological conditions do not favor application of the mass balance method. We suggest that the airborne eddy covariance method is a reliable alternative and complementary analysis method to estimate emissions from oil and gas extraction.",

In northern Tropics, the largest intraseasonal variability of SST during boreal winter is found in the SCS, with two localized regions of large standard deviation, one extending westward from the Luzon Strait and the other extending southward from the coast of central Vietnam. Correspondingly, large intraseasonal variability in surface heat fluxes is observed in the above regions. Analysis shows that the formation of large intraseasonal SST anomalies in these regions is attributed largely to wind-related surface latent heat flux changes, with supplementary contribution from cloud-related surface shortwave radiation changes. Wind-induced Ekman advection has a negative effect and the Ekman upwelling pattern differs from the intraseasonal SST anomaly pattern. The intraseasonal variations of SST in the SCS display a close association with the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) change with a time lag of 3\u20135 days. In a weak (strong) phase of the EAWM, decrease (increase) in surface wind speed and suppression (enhancement) in surface latent heat flux lead to intraseasonal SST warming (cooling). This intraseasonal SST signal displays a southward propagation with the SST change in northern SCS leading that in southern SCS by about 2 days. A similar southward propagation is seen in surface wind speed and latent heat flux anomalies. The southward propagation of cloud and shortwave radiation anomalies is limited to northern part of the SCS.",

We studied the simultaneous impacts of normalized convective available potential energy (NCAPE) and warm cloud depth (WCD) as well as cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (D \u2265 40 nm; N40) on total lightning density (TLD), average height of 30 dBZ echoes (AVGHT30), and vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) within individual CFs. The results show that TLD increases by up to 600% and AVGHT30 increases by up to 2\u20133 km with increasing NCAPE and N40 for fixed WCD. The partial sensitivity of TLD/AVGHT30 to NCAPE and N40 separately were comparable in magnitude, but account for a fraction of the total range of variability (i.e., when the influences of NCAPE and N40 are considered simultaneously). Both TLD and AVGHT30 vary inversely with WCD such that maxima of TLD and AVGHT30 are found for the combination of high NCAPE, high N40, and shallower WCD. The relationship between lightning and radar reflectivity was shown to vary as a function of N40 for a fixed thermodynamic environment. Analysis of VPRRs shows that reflectivity in the mixed phase region is up to 5.0-5.6 dB greater for CFs in polluted environments compared to CFs in pristine environments (holding thermodynamics fixed). This analysis favors a merged hypothesis for the simultaneous roles of thermodynamics and aerosols as they influence deep convective clouds in the Tropics.",

Our numerical approach allows us to calculate an estimated input-induced uncertainty for every valid retrieval during the SSMIS mission. Our uncertainty estimates are consistent with the differences observed between SSMIS wind speed and vapor measurements made by SSMIS on the F16 and F17 satellites, supporting their accuracy.

From mid-July to mid-August four distinct episodes of unseasonal southerly flow were identified and associated with upper level troughs over central Europe and the Balkans. These features developed as repeated episodes of wave breaking, leading to blocking over Europe in July, and triggered equatorward streamers of high potential vorticity. During July a two fold increase in blocking occurrence against climatology was identified over parts of Europe and was part of a 5-wave hemispheric pattern featuring abundant high-latitude blocking also over central Asia, the central Pacific and western Atlantic. Overall, the frequent european blocking resulted in the southward displacement of the midlatitude storm track towards the Balkans and the relaxation of the traditional sharp east-west pressure gradient that triggered the collapse of Etesians. The bifurcation of the midlatitude jet caused by blocking led to the intensification of the westerly flow over the Mediterranean accompanying the passing disturbances further to the north, which combined with the weak Etesians resulted in a dramatic modification of the large-scale circulation over the Mediterranean Basin.",

Interactions between propagating waves of different scales are likely to be numerous and important. We find that a static medium scale wave wind field of sufficient amplitude can channel and/or critical level filter a small scale wave or cause significant reflection, depending upon both waves\u2019 parameters. However, the inclusion of a time-dependent phase progression of the medium scale wave can reduce energy loss through critical level filtering by up to ~70% and can also reduce reflection by up to ~60% for the cases simulated. We also find that the relative direction of propagation between the small scale and medium scale wave can significantly affect small-scale wave filtering. When the phases are progressing in the same horizontal direction, the small-scale wave is far more likely to become trapped and ultimately critical level filtered than if the phases are propagating in opposite horizontal directions unless reflection occurs first. Considerations of time-dependent winds associated with medium scale propagating waves and their directionality are important for assessing the propagation and dispersion of small-scale waves over large horizontal distances.",

We develop a new LDAS that can improve the skill of an ecohydrological model to simulate simultaneously surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics by assimilating passive microwave observations that are sensitive to both surface soil moisture and terrestrial biomass. This LDAS first calibrates both hydrological and ecological parameters of a land surface model, which explicitly simulates vegetation growth and senescence. Then, it adjusts the model states of soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) sequentially using a genetic particle filter. We can adjust the subsurface soil moisture, which is not observed directly by satellites, because we simulate the interactions between vegetation dynamics and subsurface water dynamics. From a point-scale evaluation, we succeed in improving the performance of our land surface model and generate ensembles of the model state whose distribution reflects the combined information in the land surface model and satellite observations. We show that the adjustment of the subsurface soil moisture significantly improves the capacity to simulate vegetation dynamics in seasonal forecast timescales. This LDAS can contribute to the generation of ensemble initial conditions of surface and subsurface soil moisture and LAI for a probabilistic framework of weather and seasonal forecasting.\n",

Results indicate that the haze events over this region primarily occur in boreal winter of year and mainly in the morning of day. The results of the analysis of the long-term variations indicate that the annual haze days were relatively few in the 1960s but increased steeply in the 1970s and have remained stable to the present. Some differences are obvious among seasons. A stably increasing trend is discernable in summer and autumn, relatively low in the 1960s and the 1990s-2000s and relatively high in the 1970s-1980s in spring and winter. Haze variations in urban regions are quite similar to haze variations in rural regions but with more haze days in urban regions because of the high aerosol emissions. Further analyses indicate that the occurrences of severe haze events in boreal winter generally correlate with the weakened northerly winds and the development of inversion anomalies in the lower troposphere, the weakened East Asian trough in the mid-troposphere and the northward East Asian jet in the high troposphere. All of these factors provide a favorable atmospheric background for the maintenance and development of haze events in this region.",

This study uses a number of satellite-derived datasets to evaluate how well the current generation of climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulate the seasonal cycle of climatological snow cover fraction (SCF) and surface albedo over the Northern Hemisphere snow season (September \u2013 June). Using a variety of metrics, the CMIP5 models are found to simulate SCF evolution better than that of albedo. The seasonal cycle of SCF is well reproduced despite substantial biases in simulated surface albedo of snow-covered land (\u03b1sfc_snow), which affect both the magnitude and timing of the seasonal peak in \u03b1sfc_snow during the fall snow accumulation period, and the springtime snow ablation period. Insolation-weighting demonstrates that the biases in \u03b1sfc_snow during spring are of greater importance for the surface energy budget. Albedo biases are largest across the boreal forest, where the simulated seasonal cycle of albedo is biased high in 15/16 CMIP5 models. This bias is explained primarily by unrealistic treatment of vegetation masking and subsequent overestimation (more than 50% in some cases) of peak \u03b1sfc_snow, rather than by biases in SCF. While seemingly straightforward corrections to peak \u03b1sfc_snow could yield significant improvements to simulated snow albedo feedbacks, changes in \u03b1sfc_snow could potentially introduce biases in other important model variables such as surface temperature.\n",

In this study, we investigate the effects of wind shear at different vertical levels on the organization and properties of convective systems using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with spectral-bin microphysics. Based on a control run for a MCS with weak wind shear (Ctrl), we find that increasing wind shear at the lower troposphere (L-shear) leads to a more organized quasi-line convective system. Strong wind shear in the middle troposphere (M-shear) tends to produce large vorticity and form a mesocyclone circulation and an isolated strong storm that leans toward supercellular structure. By increasing wind shear at the upper vertical levels only (U-shear), the organization of the convection is not changed much, but the convective intensity is weakened. Increasing wind shear in the middle troposphere for the selected case results in a significant drying, and the drying is more significant when conserving moisture advection at the lateral boundaries, contributing to the suppressed convective strength and precipitation relative to Ctrl. Precipitation in the L- and U-shear does not change much from Ctrl. Evident changes of cloud macro- and micro-physical properties in the strong wind shear cases are mainly due to large changes in convective organization and water vapor. The insights obtained from this study help us better understand the major factors contributing to convective organization and precipitation.",

Such dry regions usually have their main moisture sources elsewhere; thus the rainfall variability is directly related to the moisture transport. This study seeks to identify source regions of water vapor for Sahelian Sudan during the monsoon period, from July to September. We have used the Lagrangian trajectory model FLEXPART driven by ERA-interim results for the time period 1998 to 2008. The results show that most of the air masses that reach this region during the monsoon period have their major origins over the Arabian Peninsula, Central Africa or are associated with the tropical easterly jet. Flow associated with ITCZ contributes almost half of the total precipitated water; most of it comes from Central Africa. This suggests that moisture recycling is the major contributor, compared to Oceanic sources. The flows from the northeast (Arabian Peninsula and north Asia) and east (Horn of Africa and north Indian Ocean) contribute about one third of the precipitated water. The rest of precipitated water comes from the Mediterranean, subtropical Atlantic and western Sahel, all with smaller contribution. Our results also indicate that different sub-regions of Sahelian Sudan have different moisture sources. Such result needs to be taken into account in seasonal forecasting practices.",

Aerosols can cause transitions between regimes of fully cloudy closed cells and open cells. The possible role of aerosols in cloud cover has a big impact on the amount of reflected solar radiation from the clouds, thus potentially constitutes very large aerosol indirect radiative effect, which can exceed 100 Wm\u22122. It is hypothesized that continentally-polluted clouds remain in closed cells regime for longer time from leaving continent and hence for longer distance away from land, thus occupying larger ocean areas with full cloud cover. Attributing this to anthropogenic aerosols would imply a very large negative radiative forcing with a significant climate impact. This possibility is confirmed by analyzing a detailed case study based on geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite observations of the microphysical and dynamical evolution of MSC. We show that large area of closed cells was formed over the northeast Atlantic Ocean downwind of Europe in a continentally polluted air mass. The closed cells undergo cleansing process that was tracked for 3.5 days that resulted with a rapid transition from closed to open cells once the clouds started drizzling heavily. The mechanism leading to the eventual breakup of the clouds due to both meteorological and aerosol considerations are elucidated. We termed this cleansing and cloud breakup process maritimization.

Here, we review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability on the properties of different drought types. The downscaled and bias-corrected data from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) was used to produce an ensemble of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed, through a relative entropy approach and was used for drought analysis. A novel multivariate drought index known as Multivariate Drought Index (MDI) was then employed for an integrated quantification of all physical forms of drought. We studied the spatial patterns of drought properties, and performed multivariate frequency analysis for each planning region in Texas to recognize the distribution of potential drought hazard areas under climate change impact by formulating a Drought Hazard Index (DHI). A drought vulnerability assessment was also carried out by taking into consideration various socio-economic factors, leading to the development of socio-economic Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI). A set of composite drought risk maps that combines hazard and vulnerability analysis were developed. This study also explored the cause-effect relationship between the drought events and several hydro climatic triggers. A transfer entropy measure was used to quantify the causal relationships, thus indicating the predominant future drought triggers. Overall, the findings are expected to help achieve an effective drought mitigation strategy for the state of Texas.",

Our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial Africa, South Asia, and the Amazon basin between June 2006 and June 2008. We identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosoltransport by region and stage of convective development. The most extensive UT ALs over equatorial Africa are associated with mature MCSs, while the most extensive UT ALs over South Asia and the Amazon are associated with growing MCSs. Convective aerosol transport over the Amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of MCSs over the Amazon. Variations in UT ALs in the vicinity oftropical MCSs are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated MCSs, and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. We also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of MCS development. Relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport are relatively weak during the decaying stage of convective development.

Due to insufficient measurements and dispersion model uncertainties, reliable interpretation of a retrieved source is limited by lack of resolution, non-uniqueness and instability in the inverse solution. The study presents an optimality analysis, in terms of resolution, stability and reliability, of an inverse solution given by a recently proposed inversion technique, called as Renormalization. The inversion technique is based on an adjoint source-receptor framework and construction of a weight function which interprets a priori information about the unknown release apparent to the monitoring network. The properties of weight function provides a perfect data resolution, maximum model resolution and minimum variance (or stability) for the retrieved source. The reliability of the retrieved source is interpreted in view of the information derived from the geometry of the monitoring network. The inversion technique and resolution features are evaluated for a point source reconstruction using measurements from a recent dispersion experiment (Fusion Field Trials 2007) conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. With the real measurements, the point release is reconstructed within an average distance of 23\u2009m from the true release where the average distance of the nearest receptor from the true source was 32\u2009m. In all the trials, the point release is retrieved within 3\u201360\u2009m euclidean distance from their true location. The source strength is retrieved within a factor of 1.5 to the true release mass. The posterior uncertainty in the release parameters is observed to be within 20% of their mean value. The source localization features are resolved to its maximum extent feasible with the design of the monitoring network. The sensitivity studies are conducted to highlight the importance of receptors reporting zero concentration measurements and variations in the resolution features of the source retrieval with respect to the various arrangements of the receptors.",

In June 2011 a comprehensive data set of ground-based and airborne in-situ measurements and remote sensing observations was acquired within the Fennec/LADUNEX field campaign in the western Sahara region. Here, we evaluate the ability of the state-of-the-art Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, newly fitted with a dust mobilization capability, to simulate dust transport in this region. We investigate a case where a large Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) triggered dust emissions in central Mali, which subsequently moved as a large cold-pool dust front towards northern Mauritania. Specifying dust mobilization for this case is shown to be an important obstacle to simulating dust transport during this event, since neither the MCS nor the associated cold pool causing dust emission are represented in the meteorological analysis. Obtaining a realistic dust transport simulation for this case therefore requires an inversion approach using a manual specification of the dust sources supported by satellite imagery. When compared to in-situ and remote-sensing data from two aircraft, the Lagrangian dust transport simulations represent the overall shape and evolution of the dust plume well. While accumulation and coarse mode dust are well represented in the simulation, giant mode particles are considerably underestimated. Our results re-emphasize that dust emission associated with deep moist convection remains a key issue for reliable dust model simulations in northern Africa.\n",

Three methods for determining the aerosol optical properties using size distributions were discussed. The first is referred to as a bin method in which the aerosol optical properties are determined for each bin of the size distribution; The second is named as an assembly mean method in which the aerosol optical properties are determined with an integration of the aerosol optical parameters over the observed size distribution; The third is a normal parameterization method based on an assumed size distribution. The bin method was used to generate the benchmark results in the radiation calculations against the methods of the assembly mean and parameterizations based on two size distribution functions, namely log-normal and Gamma were examined. It is seen that the assembly mean method can produce aerosol radiative forcing with accuracy of better than 1%. The accuracies of the parameterizations based on log-normal and Gamma size distributions are about 25% and 5%, respectively. Both the log-normal and Gamma size distribution can be determined by two parameters, the effective radius and effective variance. The better results from the Gamma size distribution can be explained by a third parameter of skewness which is found to be useful for judging how close the assumed distribution is to the observation result. The parameterizations based on the two assumed size distributions are also evaluated in a climate model. The results show that the reflected solar fluxes over the desert areas determined by the scheme based on the Gamma size distribution are about 1\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 less than those from the scheme based on the log-normal size distribution, bringing the model results closer to the observations.",

Both CESM and CMIP5 ensembles can reproduce the observed temporal and spatial variability of aridity. On the interannual time scale, annual average PET is sensitive to the variability of relative humidity, net surface energy flux, and surface air temperature while the precipitation variability is the dominant component of annual average aridity sensitivity. For the long-term trends, differences between the two ensembles illustrate that the impact of the internal variability is smaller than that of the model structural uncertainty with the trends from the CMIP5 ensemble of models having a much larger spread than those from the single model CESM-LE. The annual mean aridity averaged over global land increases (becomes drier) by 6.4% in 2055\u20132080 relative to 1980\u20132005. Aridity trends differ by region in the ensemble mean. In the future, increasing precipitation leads to decreasing aridity over northwest China and central (or tropical) Africa, while decreasing precipitation leads to drying (increasing aridity) in the sub-tropics, northern and southern Africa and the Amazon.

        "description": "\n\nSurface ozone (O3) air pollution in populated regions has been attributed to emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) and reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These constituents react with hydrogen oxide radicals (OH + HO2 = HOx) in the presence of sunlight and heat to produce O3. The question of whether to reduce NOx emissions, VOC emissions, or both, is complicated by spatially and temporally heterogeneous ozone-NOx-VOC sensitivity. This study characterizes spatial and temporal variation in O3 sensitivity by analyzing the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO, a marker of VOCs) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a metric known as the Formaldehyde Nitrogen Ratio (FNR). Level-3 gridded retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA Aura satellite were used to calculate FNR, with our analysis focusing on China. Based on previous studies, we take FNR<1.0 as indicating VOC-limited regimes, FNR>2.0 as indicating NOx-limited regime, and FNR between 1.0 and 2.0 as indicating transitional regime (where either NOx reductions or VOC reductions would be expected to reduce O3). We find that the transitional regime is widespread over the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during the ozone season (defined as having near surface air temperatures > 20\u00b0 C at the early-afternoon OMI overpass time). Outside of these regions, the NOx-limited regime is dominant. Because HCHO and NO2 have distinct seasonal patterns, FNR also has a pronounced seasonality, consistent with the seasonal cycle of surface O3. Examining trends from 2005 to 2013 indicates rapid growth in NO2, especially over less-developed areas where O3 photochemistry is NOx-limited. Over this time period, HCHO decreased in southern China where VOC emissions are dominated by biogenic sources, but increased slightly over the NCP where VOC emissions are dominated by anthropogenic sources. A linear regression approach suggests that most of China (70% of grid cells) will be characterized by a transitional regime during the O3 season by 2030. However, in megacities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, NO2 has decreased such that the chemical regime has shifted from VOC-limited in 2005 to transitional in 2013.\n",

Both the linear correlation between wind divergence and downwind SST gradient and the correspondence between vorticity and crosswind SST gradient support the vertical momentum mixing mechanism, which indicates that SST perturbations modify surface winds by changing the vertical turbulent mixing in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). High-resolution NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data can reproduce the atmospheric responses to the oceanic eddies in the MABL albeit with some differences in intensity. In addition, the CFSR data reveal that the atmospheric responses to these oceanic eddies are not confined in the MABL. MABL deepens (shoals) over the warm (cold) eddies; enhanced (reduced) vertical transport of transient zonal momentum occurs over the warm (cold) eddies from the sea surface to about 850-hPa level; vertical velocity anomalies over oceanic eddies penetrate beyond the MABL into free atmosphere; there exists a positive correlated relationship between SST and convective rain rate anomalies, indicative of ocean eddies' impact on the free troposphere.

An overflight of a four-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB digital camera sensor was carried out during the field operations. Finally, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data covering the Central European Alps were analyzed.\nObserved reflectance evidenced that MD strongly reduced the spectral reflectance of snow, in particular from 350 to 600 nm. Reflectance was compared with that simulated by parameterizing the Snow, Ice and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) radiative transfer model. We defined a novel spectral index, the Snow Darkening Index (SDI), that combines different wavelengths showing nonlinear correlation with measured MD concentrations (R2=0.87, RMSE=0.037). We also estimated a positive instantaneous radiative forcing that reaches values up to 153 W/m2 for the most concentrated sampling area.\nSDI maps at local scale were produced using the UAV data, while regional SDI maps were generated with OLI data. These maps show the spatial distribution of MD in snow after a natural deposition from the Saharan desert. Such post-depositional experimental data are fundamental for validating radiative transfer models and Global Climate Models (GCM) that simulate the impact of MD on snow radiative properties.\n",

Until recently, no in-situ observations have been available to investigate links between microphysical snowfall properties and their scattering properties. In this study, we investigate for the first time relations between collocated ground-based triple frequency observations with in-situ measurements of snowfall at the ground. The three analyzed snowfall cases obtained during a recent field campaign in Finland, cover light to moderate snowfall rates with transitions from heavily rimed snow to open-structured, low density snowflakes. The observed triple frequency signatures agree well with the previously published findings from airborne radar observations. A rich spatio-temporal structure of triple frequency observations throughout the cloud is observed during the three cases, which often seems to be related to riming and aggregation zones within the cloud. The comparison of triple frequency signatures from the lowest altitudes with the ground-based in-situ measurements reveals that in the presence of large (>5 mm) snow aggregates, a bending-away in the triple frequency space from the curve of classical spheroid scattering models is always observed. Rimed particles appear along an almost horizontal line in the triple frequency space, which was not observed before. Overall, the three case studies indicate a close connection of triple frequency signatures and snow particle structure, bulk snowfall density, and characteristic size of the PSD.",

Accurate EASM rainfall prediction necessitates robust palaeoclimate reconstructions from proxy data and quantitative linkage to modern climatic conditions. Many precisely-dated oxygen isotope records from Chinese stalagmites have been interpreted as directly reflecting past EASM rainfall amount variability, but recent research suggests such records instead integrate multiple hydroclimatic processes. Using a Lagrangian precipitation moisture source diagnostic, we demonstrate that EASM rainfall is primarily derived from the Indian Ocean. Conversely, Pacific Ocean moisture export peaks during winter and the moisture uptake area does not differ significantly between summer and winter, and is thus a minor contributor to monsoonal precipitation. Our results are substantiated by an accurate reproduction of summer and winter spatial rainfall distributions across China. We also correlate modern EASM rainfall oxygen isotope ratios with instrumental rainfall amount and our moisture source data. This analysis reveals that the strength of the source effect is geographically variable, and differences in atmospheric moisture transport may significantly impact the isotopic signature of EASM rainfall at the Hulu, Dongge and Wanxiang Cave sites. These results improve our ability to isolate the rainfall amount signal in palaeomonsoon reconstructions and indicate that precipitation across central and eastern China will directly respond to variability in Indian Ocean moisture supply.",

        "description": "\n\nTwo years of ground-based remote sensing observations are used to study the vertical structure of marine cumulus near the Island of Barbados, including their cloud fraction and mass flux profile. Daily radar derived cloud fraction profiles peak at different height levels depending on the depth of cumuli and thus the extent to which they precipitate. Non-precipitating cumuli have a peak cloud fraction of about 5 % near mean cloud base (700 m), whereas precipitating cumuli tend to have a peak of only 2 % near cloud base. Nineteen percent of the precipitating cumuli are accompanied by large cloud fractions near the detrainment level of cumulus tops (~1,700 m). Day-to-day variations in cloud fraction near cloud base are modest (~3 %). Non-precipitating cumuli have their largest reflectivities near cloud top and an ascending core surrounded by a subsiding shell. Precipitating cumuli with enhanced elevated cloudiness (stratiform outflow) are deeper and contain larger vertical gradients in reflectivity and Doppler velocity than precipitating cumuli without such outflow. Bulk (3h) statistics reveal that non-precipitating shallow cumuli are active and organized. They contain on average 79 % in-cloud updrafts with 86 % of them being organized in large coherent structures contributing to a maximum updraft mass flux of 8-36 gm\u22122s\u22121 just above cloud base. Alternatively, downdrafts contribute insignificantly to the mass flux and show little vertical and temporal variability (0-7 gm\u22122s\u22121). Complementary Raman lidar information suggests that updraft mass flux profile slope is inversely related to environmental relative humidity.",

        "description": "\n\nThis study analyzes the effects of atmospheric absorption and emission on the polarization difference (PD) and brightness temperature (TB) generated by horizontally-oriented snow particles. A three-layer plane-parallel atmosphere model is used in conjunction with a simplified radiative transfer (RT) scheme to illustrate the combined effects of dichroic and non-dichroic media on microwave signatures observed by ground-based and space-borne sensors. Based on idealized scenarios which encompass a dichroic snow layer and adjacent non-dichroic layers composed of supercooled liquid water (SCLW) droplets and water vapor, we demonstrate that the presence of atmospheric absorption/emission enhances TB and damps PD when observed from the ground. From a space-borne perspective, however, TB can be reduced or enhanced by an absorbing/emitting layer above the snow layer, while a strong absorbing/emitting layer below the dichroic snow layer may even enhance PD. The induced PD and TB which rely on snow microphysical assumptions can vary up to 2 K and 10 K, respectively, due to the temperature-dependent absorption of SCLW. RT calculations based on 223 snowfall profiles selected from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) datasets indicate that the existence of SCLW has a noticeable impact on PD and TB at three window frequencies (150 GHz, 243 GHz and 664 GHz) during snowfall. Our results imply that while polarimetric channels at the three window channels have the potential for snowfall characterization, accurate information on liquid water is required to correctly interpret the polarimetric observations.",

The storm was observed on 22 February 2012 as part of the AgI (silver iodide) Seeding Cloud Impact Investigation (ASCII) experiment in Wyoming. The cloud base (top) temperature was about \u22125\u2009\u00b0C (\u221212\u2009\u00b0C). Vertical velocity data from an airborne Doppler W-band (3\u2009mm) profiling Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) indicate broad ascent due to the strong wind (20\u2009m\u2009s-1) impinging on the terrain, and small pockets of intense updrafts. The large droplets, low droplet and ice particle concentrations, and strong updrafts lead to natural snow growth mainly by accretion (riming). The treated (seeded) period is compared with the preceding untreated period. The main target site, located on a mountain pass, was impacted by AgI seeding, according to a trace chemistry analysis of the falling snow.\nData from three radar systems were used in the analysis of the impact of seeding on snow growth: the WCR, two Ka-band (1.2\u2009cm) profiling Micro-Rain Radars (MRR), and a X-band (3\u2009cm) scanning polarization Doppler-on-Wheels (DOW) radar. This case is complicated somewhat by a natural increase in cloud liquid water and in snow growth by riming, starting halfway during the seeding period, and continuing after seeding ended. Composite data from the cm-wave radar systems indicate an increase in low-level reflectivity during seeding, even after accounting for the natural trend observed in the upwind control region. A precipitation particle probe at the main target site shows an increase in concentration of both small and large hydrometeors.",

The results indicated that a horizontal gradient of sulfate from the source over China to the outflow over Korea-Japan was present in both the simulations and the observations. At the observation sites, the correlation coefficients of the sulfate concentrations between the simulations and the observations were high (NICAM: 0.49-0.89, MIROC: 0.61-0.77), whereas the simulated sulfate concentrations were lower than those obtained by the observation with the normalized mean bias of NICAM being \u221268 to \u221254% (all), \u221277 to \u221263% (source), and \u221267 to \u221230% (outflow) and that of MIROC being \u221261 to \u221228% (all), \u221277 to \u221263% (source), and \u221260 to +2% (outflow). Both NICAM and MIROC strongly underpredict surface SO2 over China source regions and Korea-Japan outflow regions, but the MIROC SO2 is much higher than NICAM over both regions. These differences between the models were mainly explained by differences in the sulfate formation within clouds and the dry deposition of SO2. These results indicated that the uncertainty of the meteorological and cloud fields as well as the vertical transport patterns between the different host climate models has a substantial impact on the simulated sulfate distribution.",

The calibrated dataset documents seasonal variations in the relationship between \u03b418O and local humidity (ppmv), and between deuterium excess and \u03b418O. These seasonal variations are attributed to seasonal changes in atmospheric transport. A strong linear relationship is observed between deuterium excess and atmospheric relative humidity calculated at regional sea surface temperature. Surprisingly, we find a similar relationship between deuterium excess and relative humidity as observed in the Bermuda Islands. During days with low amount of isotopic depletion (more enriched values), our data significantly deviate from the global meteoric water line. This feature can be explained by a supply of an evaporative flux into the planetary boundary layer above the ocean, which we show using a 1-d box model. Based on the close relationship identified between moisture origin and deuterium excess, we combine deuterium excess measurements performed in Iceland and south Greenland with moisture source diagnostics based on back-trajectory calculations to establish the distribution of d-excess moisture uptake values across the North Atlantic. We map high deuterium excess in the Arctic, and low deuterium excess for vapor in the subtropics and mid-latitudes.

The simulations integrate a new satellite dataset for urban extent and a geo-located crowd-sourced dataset for road surface area and consider differences only in urban land cover and its physical properties. The simulations account for changes in meteorologically driven natural emissions, but do not include changes in anthropogenic emissions resulting from urbanization and road network variations. The astounding urbanization, which quadrupled Beijing urban extent between 2000 and 2009 in terms of physical infrastructure change, created a ring of impact that decreased surface albedo, increased ground and near-surface air temperatures, increased vertical turbulent kinetic energy, and decreased the near-surface relative humidity and wind speed. The meteorological changes alone decreased near-surface particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and many other chemicals due to vertical dilution but increased near-surface ozone due to the higher temperature and lower NO. Vertical dilution and wind stagnation increased elevated pollution layers and column aerosol extinction. In sum, the ring of impact around Beijing may have increased urban heating, dried soil, mixed pollutants vertically, aggravated air stagnation, and increased near-surface oxidant pollution even before accounting for changes in anthropogenic emissions.",

Global mean LNOx production rates of 0 to 492 mol NO flash\u22121 and the subsequent responses of NOx, ozone (O3), hydroxyl radical (OH), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and NOy (NOx + HNO3 + PAN) are investigated. The radiative implications associated with LNOx-induced changes in tropospheric O3 are assessed. Increasing the LNOx production rate by a factor of 4 (from 123 to 492 mol flash\u22121) leads to tropical upper-tropospheric enhancements of greater than 100 % in NOx, OH, HNO3 and PAN. This increase in LNOx also leads to O3 enhancements of up to 60 %, which subsequently yields a factor-of-three increase in the mean net radiative flux at the tropopause. An LNOx source of 246 mol flash\u22121 agrees reasonably well with measurements, with an approximate factor-of-two uncertainty due to the short length of the study, inconsistencies in the observational data sets, and systematic biases in modeled LNOx production. Further research into the regional dependencies of lightning flash rates and LNOx production per flash, as well as improvements in satellite retrievals, should help resolve the discrepancies that currently exist between the model and observations.\n",

The 0.1-s maximum wind speed and pressure deficit near the ground were recorded as 35.3 m s-1 and \u20133.8 hPa, respectively. The horizontal two-dimensional distributions of the tornadic vortex wind and pressure were retrieved by the LAWPS data, which provided unprecedented observational detail on the following important features of the near-surface structure of the tornadic vortex. Asymmetric convergent inflow toward the vortex center existed. Total wind speed was strong to the right and rear side of the translational direction of the vortex and weak in the forward part of the vortex possibly because of the strong convergent inflow in that region. The tangential wind speed profile of the vortex was better approximated using a modified Rankine vortex rather than the Rankine vortex both at 5 m AGL and 100 m AGL, and other vortex models (Burgers-Rott and Wood-White vortex) were also compared. The cyclostrophic wind balance was violated in the core radius R0 and outside the core radius in the forward sector; however, it was held with a relatively high accuracy of approximately 14 % outside the core of the vortex in the rearward sector (from 2R0 to 5R0) near the ground.",

The complete removal of the Congo basin rainforest results in a dipole rainfall anomaly pattern, characterized by a decrease (~ -42%) in rainfall over the western Congo and an increase (~10%) in the basin's eastern part. Three further experiments systematically examine the individual response to the changes in albedo, surface roughness and evapotranspiration efficiency that accompany deforestation. The increased albedo (~0.05) caused by the Congo basin rainforest clearance results in cooler and drier climate conditions over the entire basin. The drying is accompanied with a reduction in available surface energy. Reducing evapotranspiration efficiency or roughness length produce similar positive air temperature anomaly patterns. The decreased evapotranspiration efficiency leads to a dipole response in rainfall, similar to that resulting from a reduced surface roughness following Congo basin rainforest clearance. This precipitation anomaly pattern is strongly linked to the change in low level water vapor transport, the influence of the Rift valley highlands and the spatial pattern of water recycling activity. The climate responds linearly to the separate albedo, surface roughness and evapotranspiration efficiency changes, which can be summed to produce a close approximation to the impact of the full deforestation experiment. It is suggested that the widely contrasting climate responses to deforestation in the literature could be partly due to the relative magnitude of change of the radiative and non-radiative parameterizations in their respective land-surface schemes.",

The LES models are driven by continuous large-scale and surface forcings, and are constrained by multi-modal and temporally varying aerosol number size distribution profiles derived from aircraft observations. We compare simulated cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties with ground-based remote sensing and aircraft observations. The LES simulations capture the observed transitions of the evolving cumulus-topped boundary layers during the three daytime periods, and generally reproduce variations of droplet number concentration with liquid water content (LWC), corresponding to the gradient between the cloud centers and cloud edges at given heights. The observed LWC values fall within the range of simulated values; the observed droplet number concentrations are commonly higher than simulated, but differences remain on par with potential estimation errors in the aircraft measurements. Sensitivity studies examine the influences of bin microphysics versus bulk microphysics, aerosol advection, supersaturation treatment, and aerosol hygroscopicity. Simulated macrophysical cloud properties are found to be insensitive in this non-precipitating case, but microphysical properties are especially sensitive to bulk microphysics supersaturation treatment and aerosol hygroscopicity.",

Here, using the NASA GEOS-5 model with aerosol tracers and a state-of-the-art snow darkening module (GOddard SnoW Impurity Module, or GOSWIM) for the land surface, we examine the role of SDE on climate in the boreal spring snowmelt season. SDE is found to produce significant warming (over 15 W m\u22122) over broad areas in mid-latitudes, with dust being the most important contributor to the warming in Central Asia and the western Himalayas and with BC having larger impact in the Europe, eastern Himalayas, East Asia, and North America. The contribution of OC to the warming is generally low but still significant mainly over southeastern Siberia, northeastern East Asia, and western Canada (~19% of the total solar visible absorption by these snow impurities). The simulations suggest that SDE strengthens the boreal spring water cycle in East Asia through water recycling and moisture advection from the ocean and contributes to the maintenance of dry conditions in parts of a region spanning Europe to Central Asia, partially through feedbacks on the model\u0149s background climatology. Overall, our study suggests that the existence of SDE in the Earth system associated with dust, BC, and OC contributes significantly to enhanced surface warming over continents in northern hemisphere midlatitudes during boreal spring, raising the surface skin temperature by approximately 3\u20136 K near the snowline.\n",

This study examines the potential climate impacts of the onset of an extreme \u2018Maunder Minimum like\u2019 grand solar minimum using a comprehensive global climate model. Over the second half of the 21st century, the scenario assumes a decrease in total solar irradiance of 0.12% compared to a reference RCP8.5 experiment. The decrease in solar irradiance cools the stratopause (~1 hPa) in the annual and global mean by 1.4 K. The impact on global mean near-surface temperature is small (~\u22120.1 K), but larger changes in regional climate occur during the stratospheric dynamically active seasons. In Northern hemisphere (NH) winter-time, there is a weakening of the stratospheric westerly jet by up to ~3-4 m s1, with the largest changes occurring in January-February. This is accompanied by a deepening of the Aleutian low at the surface and an increase in blocking over northernEurope and the north Pacific. There is also an equatorward shift in the Southern hemisphere (SH) midlatitude eddy-driven jet in austral spring. The occurrence of an amplified regional response during winter and spring suggests a contribution froma top-down pathway for solar-climate coupling; this is tested using an experiment in which ultraviolet (200\u2013320 nm) radiation is decreased in isolation of other changes. The results show that a large decline in solar activity over the 21st centurycould have important impacts on the stratosphere and regional surface climate.",

Model ensembles are initialized in 1980 from the transient historical runs and driven with forcings used in the CMIP5 experiments and updated forcings based upon current observational understanding, described in Part 1. The ensembles\u2019 surface temperature trends are statistically indistinguishable over 1998-2012 despite differences in the prescribed forcings. There is thus no evidence that forcing errors play a significant role in explaining the hiatus according to NorESM. The observations fall either towards the lower portion of the ensembles or, for some observational estimates and regions, outside. The exception is the Arctic where the observations fall towards the upper ensemble bounds. Observational dataset choices can make a large difference to findings of consistency or otherwise. Those NorESM ensemble members that exhibit nino3.4 SST trends similar to observed also exhibit comparable tropical and to some extent global-mean trends, supporting a role for ENSO in explaining the hiatus. Several ensemble members capture the marked seasonality observed in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude trends, with cooling in the wintertime and warming in the remaining seasons. Overall, we find that we cannot falsify NorESM as being capable of explaining the observed hiatus behavior. Importantly, this is not equivalent to concluding NorESM could simultaneously capture all important facets of the hiatus. Similar experiments with further, distinct, Earth System Models are required to verify our findings.",

X-band polarimetric radar, disdrometer, and hydrometeor videosonde data were used to examine the precipitation processes. The cloud top was approximately 12\u2009km above sea level, as convection was depressed while stratiform regions developed near Okinawa Island. In the rain region below 3\u2009km, the mean median volume diameter of the raindrop size distribution (DSD) estimated from the radar variables was 1.55\u2009mm, and the mean normalized intercept parameter was 104.12\u2009mm\u22121\u2009m\u22123 with a mean radar reflectivity of 40.5\u2009dBZe. The DSD indicates that the stratiform precipitation was characterized by higher number concentrations of smaller drops than observed previously in convective cells in a Baiu frontal convective precipitation region around Okinawa Island. The DSD also suggests the presence of larger raindrops than in convective cells embedded in a Baiu frontal stratiform precipitation region around Okinawa Island. In the ice region at 5\u20136\u2009km, just above the melting layer and 6\u2009km below the cloud top, the differential reflectivity and specific differential phase showed positive values, and videosonde measurements revealed that the number concentration of column-, plate-, and capped-column-like crystals (maximum dimensions of \u22650.1\u2009mm) was 112\u2009L\u22121.

The simulation results show that the mean aerosol loading and optical depth over the region are 17.87\u2009mg/m2 and 0.25, respectively. Sulfate and black carbon (BC) account for approximately 61.2% and 7.8% of the total aerosols, respectively. The regional mean radiative forcing (RF) is approximately \u22123.64, \u22120.55, and +0.88\u2009W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere for the total aerosol effect, the total aerosol direct effect, and the BC direct effect, respectively. The surface direct RF of BC accounts for approximately 31% of the total RF of all aerosols. Because of the total aerosol effect, both the energy budgets and air temperature are considerably reduced in the region with high aerosol loadings, leading to decreases in the land-ocean air temperature gradient in summer. The total column-absorbed solar radiation and surface air temperature decrease by 8.4\u2009W/m2 and 0.31\u2009K, respectively. This cooling effect weakens horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulations over East Asia. The wind speed at 850\u2009hPa decreases by 0.18\u2009m/s, and the precipitation decreases by 0.29\u2009mm/d. The small responses of solar radiation, air temperature, and atmospheric circulations to the BC warming effect are opposite to those of the total aerosol effect. The BC-induced enhancement of atmospheric circulation can increase local floods in south China, while droughts in north China may worsen in response to the BC semidirect effect. The total aerosol effect is much more significant than the BC direct effect. The East Asian summer monsoon becomes weaker due to the total aerosol effect. However, this weakness could be partially offset by the BC warming effect. Sensitivity analyses further indicate that the influence of aerosols on the EASM might be more substantial in years when the southerlies or southwesterlies at 850\u2009hPa are weak compared with years when the winds are strong. Changes in the EASM can induce variations in the distribution and magnitude of aerosols. Aerosols in the lower troposphere over the region can increase by 3.07 and 1.04\u2009\u00b5g/m3 due to the total aerosol effect and the BC warming effect, respectively.",

Meteorology from 10\u2009years in the 1990s (present) and 10\u2009years in the 2050s (future) based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario is used. Anthropogenic pollutant emissions are assumed to remain constant, while biogenic emissions are climate sensitive and, depending on species, increase between 15 and 27% on average. The predicted changes of PM2.5 are modest (increases of less than 10% on average across the domain) and quite variable in space, ranging from +13% in the Plains to \u22127% in the Northeast. Variability is driven concurrently by changes in temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and relative humidity, with no single dominant meteorological factor. Sulfate and organic aerosol are responsible for most of the PM2.5 change. The improved treatment of organic aerosol using the volatility basis set does not increase significantly its sensitivity to climate change compared to traditional treatments that neglect the volatility of primary particles and do not simulate the chemical aging processes. Future organic aerosol is predicted to be more oxidized due to increases of its secondary biogenic and anthropogenic components. These results suggest that the effects of planned and expected emission anthropogenic emission controls will be more important than those of climate change for PM2.5 concentrations in 2050. Maximum daily 8\u2009h average ozone increases by 5% on average are predicted, with a marked increase in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest.",

This is due to difficulties in modeling cloudy radiances as well as in observing their vertical structure from space. To take full advantage of the thermodynamic information in advanced infrared (IR) sounder observations requires assimilating radiances from cloud-contaminated regions. An optimal imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique has been developed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This technique can be used to retrieve clear column radiances through combining collocated multiband imager IR clear radiances and the sounder cloudy radiances; no background information is needed in this method. The imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique is similar to that of the microwave/IR cloud clearing in the derivation of the clear-sky equivalent radiances. However, it retains the original IR sounder resolution, which is critical for regional numerical weather prediction applications. In this study, we have investigated the assimilation of cloud-cleared IR sounder radiances using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for three hurricanes, Sandy (2012), Irene (2011), and Ike (2008). Results show that assimilating additional cloud-cleared AIRS radiances reduces the 48 and 72\u2009h temperature forecast root-mean-square error by 0.1\u20130.3\u2009K between 300 and 850\u2009hPa.

The rationale underpinning the method consists in exploiting the peculiar features observed in Doppler spectra caused by the wavelength dependence of scattering and absorption properties. A notional study based on a large data set of DSDs measured by a two-dimensional video disdrometer demonstrates that the retrieval performs best for small/moderate air broadening spectral width and when mean volume diameters exceed at least 1\u2009mm. The retrieval is also limited to ranges below cloud base and where the signal-to-noise ratio of both radars exceed 10\u2009dB, which rules out regions affected by strong attenuation. Broadly speaking, it is applicable to rain rates comprised between roughly 1 and 30\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121. Preliminary retrieval for observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site shows very good agreement with independent reflectivity measurements from a 0.915\u2009GHz wind profiler.

Broadband albedo is shown for mass fractions covering the full range from pure snow to pure BC and pure dust, and for snow grain radii from 5\u2009\u00b5m to 2500\u2009\u00b5m, to cover the range of possible grain sizes on planetary surfaces. Parameterizations are developed for opaque homogeneous snowpacks for three broad bands used in general circulation models and several narrower bands. They are functions of snow grain radius and the mass fraction of BC and/or dust and are valid up to BC content of 10\u2009ppm, needed for highly polluted snow. A change of solar zenith angle can be mimicked by changing grain radius. A given mass fraction of BC causes greater albedo reduction in coarse-grained snow; BC and grain radius can be combined into a single variable to compute the reduction of albedo relative to pure snow. The albedo reduction by BC is less if the snow contains dust, a common situation on mountain glaciers and in agricultural and grazing lands. Measured absorption spectra of mineral dust are critically reviewed as a basis for specifying dust properties for modeling. The effect of dust on snow albedo at visible wavelengths can be represented by an \u201cequivalent BC\u201d amount, scaled down by a factor of about 200. Dust has little effect on the near-IR albedo because the near-IR albedo of pure dust is similar to that of pure snow.",

CIPS measurements are analyzed to detect patterns that repeat from one orbit to the next but are displaced in location; the displacement provides a measure of the wind velocity. Pattern matching is achieved by resampling the CIPS data to longitude and latitude grids with the grid-box size forced at ~5\u2009km in both directions. The correlated patterns are searched within a geographic region referred to as a \u201cframe\u201d of ~500\u2009km in longitude\u2009\u00d7\u2009400\u2009km in latitude.

Mean meridional winds are overall small, but in late summer the histogram indicated a poleward wind of ~20\u201330\u2009m/s. The variability of CIPS cloud albedo on consecutive orbits is also examined at fixed geolocations. The statistical results suggest that ~86% of pairs underwent mean cloud albedo variation of < 50% on consecutive orbits, suggesting a moderate change. It is also found that the correlation of the cloud structures between two consecutive orbits at a fixed location is generally poor. These findings suggest that cloud patterns are subject to wind advection, but the cloud patches are more extended in size than the movement that occurs. Cloud voids are found to be more likely to remain at the same geolocations.",

This work calculates a semiempirical lifetime based on Microwave Limb Sounder satellite measurements of stratospheric profiles of nitrous oxide, ozone, and temperature; laboratory cross-section data for ozone and molecular oxygen plus kinetics for O(1D); the observed solar spectrum; and a simple radiative transfer model. The result is 116\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009years. The observed monthly-to-biennial variations in lifetime and tropical abundance are well matched by four independent chemistry-transport models driven by reanalysis meteorological fields for the period of observation (2005\u20132010), but all these models overestimate the lifetime due to lower abundances in the critical loss region near 32\u2009km in the tropics. These models plus a chemistry-climate model agree on the nitrous oxide feedback factor on its own lifetime of 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, giving N2O perturbations an effective residence time of 109\u2009years. Combining this new empirical lifetime with model estimates of residence time and preindustrial lifetime (123\u2009years) adjusts our best estimates of the human-natural balance of emissions today and improves the accuracy of projected nitrous oxide increases over this century.",

Two numerical experiments using past and current land use scenarios successfully simulated the observed temperature trends, showing a greater rate of warming in winter than in summer and a greater increase in daily minimum than daily maximum temperatures. The results suggest that seasonal and diurnal variations in the thermal structure of the planetary boundary layer play a leading role in determining the warming rate of surface air. Under strongly stable stratification, anomalous heating within the urban canopy dissipates into a near-surface shallow layer, resulting in increased daily minimum temperatures during winter. In summer, however, anomalous urban heating due to increased Bowen ratios is attenuated by vertical mixing in the convective daytime boundary layer, suppressing the impact of urban heating on surface warming.",

For this, we use observational data from paired eddy covariance flux towers in Europe, representing a LUC from forest to open land (deforestation). Two model simulations with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM2 (The Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling model in climate mode COSMO-CLM coupled to the Community Land Model CLM) are performed which differ only in prescribed land use for site pair locations. The model is evaluated by comparing the observed and simulated difference in surface temperature (Ts) between open land and forests. Next, we identify the biogeophysical mechanisms responsible for Ts differences by applying a decomposition method to both observations and model simulations. This allows us to determine which LUC-related mechanisms were well represented in COSMO-CLM2, and which were not. Results from observations show that deforestation leads to a significant cooling at night, which is severely underestimated by COSMO-CLM2. It appears that the model is missing one crucial impact of deforestation on the nighttime surface energy budget: a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation. Results are better for daytime, as the model is able to simulate the increase in albedo and associated surface cooling following deforestation reasonably well. Also well simulated, albeit underestimated slightly, is the decrease in sensible heat flux caused by reduced surface roughness. Overall, these results stress the importance of differentiating between daytime and nighttime climate when discussing the effect of LUC on climate. Finally, we believe that they provide new insights supporting a wider application of the methodology (to other regional climate models).",

This crucial dependence is nonlinear, with different types and orders of nonlinearity that are due to differences in the absorption/emission and scattering signatures at the different instrument frequencies. Because it is not monotone as a function of the underlying condensed water mass, the nonlinearity requires great care in its representation in the observation operator, as the inevitable uncertainties in the numerous precipitation variables are not directly convertible into an additive white uncertainty in the forward calculated observations. In particular, when attempting to assimilate such data into a cloud-permitting model, special care needs to be applied to describe and quantify the expected uncertainty in the observations operator in order not to turn the implicit white additive uncertainty on the input values into complicated biases in the calculated radiances. One approach would be to calculate the means and covariances of the nonlinearly calculated radiances given an a priori joint distribution for the input variables. This would be a very resource-intensive proposal if performed in real time. We propose a representation of the observation operator based on performing this moment calculation off line, with a dimensionality reduction step to allow for the effective calculation of the observation operator and the associated covariance in real time during the assimilation. The approach is applicable to other remotely sensed observations that depend nonlinearly on model variables, including wind vector fields. The approach has been successfully applied to the case of tropical cyclones, where the organization of the system helps in identifying the dimensionality-reducing variables.",

An ensemble of experiments forced only by changing SSTs is compared to an ensemble of experiments in which both the observed SSTs and chemically and radiatively active trace species are changing. By comparing the two ensembles, it is shown that warming of Indian Ocean, North Pacific, and North Atlantic SSTs and cooling of the tropical Pacific have strongly contributed to recent polar stratospheric cooling in late winter and early spring. When concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases are fixed, polar ozone concentrations show a small but robust decline due to changing SSTs. Ozone loss is larger in the presence of changing concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases. The stratospheric changes can be understood by examining the tropospheric height and heat flux anomalies generated by the anomalous SSTs.

For short-lived compounds, ERF can be highly inhomogeneous geographically. The relationship between the spatial patterns of ERF and surface temperature response is poorly characterized, however. We examine that relationship in the latest generation of global climate models. We find that the uneven distribution of historical aerosol, ozone, and land use forcing leads to substantial differences compared to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG). There is a stronger response per unit global mean forcing to historical inhomogeneous forcing than to WMGHG both globally and in much of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics, in fairly good agreement with results inferred from observations. Our results indicate that the enhanced global mean response is attributable to the concentration of inhomogeneous forcing in the NH extratropics, where there is strongest sensitivity to forcing, rather than to processes specific to the inhomogeneous forcers. In many regions, inclusion of inhomogeneous forcing greatly increases the spread in historical temperature changes simulated by the models, suggesting that better forcing characterization could play an important role in improving modeling of decadal-scale regional climate change. Finally, incorporating observed temperatures, the results provide estimates of global historical aerosol forcing (\u22121.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009W\u2009m\u22122) consistent with other studies (though with narrower uncertainties) and also provide constraints on NH and NH extratropical historical aerosol forcing (\u22121.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 and \u22121.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, respectively) and aerosol\u2009+\u2009ozone forcing.",

These changes reduce OMI SCD(NO2) by 10\u201335%, bringing them much closer to SCDs retrieved from independent measurements and models. The revised SCDs, submitted to the stratosphere-troposphere separation algorithm, give tropospheric VCDs \u223c10\u201315% smaller in polluted regions, and up to \u223c30% smaller in unpolluted areas. Although the revised algorithm has been optimized specifically for the OMI NO2 retrieval, our approach could be more broadly applicable.",

        "description": "\n\nThe impact of sandwich foehn on air pollution in Urumqi, a gap town located on the northern lee side of the Tianshan Mountains of China, is analyzed. The results show that during days with high pollution, the boundary layer over the city and the down-valley area can be divided into a three-layer structure, with the southeasterly foehn sandwiched between the northwesterly winds on top and the cold air surface pool beneath. The southeasterly foehn at heights between 480 and 2100\u2009m results in a very stable boundary layer structure. In combination with the decoupling between the foehn flow and cold air pool, such boundary layer structure prevents vertical mixing of atmospheric pollutants. In the up-valley area from the northern lee side flank to the southern urban area, the ground-based foehn confronts the thermally driven valley breeze and forms a \u201cminifront,\u201d which moves northward in the morning and retreats southward in the afternoon. Although the minifront disappears in the early evening, the wind shear of the mountain breeze between the southern suburb and downtown areas is still remarkable, which is favorable for a convergence line to persist around the city all day long. In this case, air pollutants emitted from the up-valley and down-valley areas are transported toward the urban area. Therefore, the air pollutants accumulate daily, leading to the frequent occurrence of heavy pollution events in Urumqi. This indicates that the sandwich foehn plays a critical role in the formation of heavy air pollution events in Urumqi.",

The data are used to deduce atmospheric deposition histories of TEs over ~130\u2009years. The cores were collected using a gravity corer, sliced, freeze dried, and ages determined using 210Pb and 137Cs techniques. TE data in WPP were supplemented with our earlier elemental carbon (EC) measurements. Lithophilic elements showed no systematic temporal pattern or any significant enrichment over their crustal abundances. Anthropogenic TEs exhibited distinct increases beginning ~1900, and peaked around 1920\u20131970, due apparently to energy-related emissions. Peak concentrations of most TEs, except Pb and Hg, were observed at ~1921 in WPP and ~1940s in CP. Concentration of Pb peaked in 1973 in both lakes and Hg only in CP at ~1965. Lead fluxes were reflective of historical smelter production and combustion of coal and leaded gasoline. Copper and zinc fluxes mimicked corresponding primary production, while EC fluxes followed the long-term trend for fossil and biofuel combustion. TE and EC flux trends were closely related to the growth of industrialization in the Central and Midwestern U.S. and changing fuel consumption patterns. Compared to peak values, the modern TE fluxes decreased by 25\u201385%, whereas EC decreased by 96%. Apparently, the regulations intended to control pollutant emissions have succeeded in reducing atmospheric concentrations of the species studied and have improved air quality.",

Here an algorithm is introduced to simultaneously retrieve above-cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT), the cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective particle radius (CER) of the underlying MBL clouds while also providing pixel-level estimates of retrieval uncertainty. This approach utilizes reflectance measurements at six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels from the visible to the shortwave infrared. Retrievals are run under two aerosol model assumptions on 8\u2009years (2006\u20132013) of June\u2013October Aqua MODIS data over the SE Atlantic, from which a regional cloud and above-cloud aerosol climatology is produced. The cloud retrieval methodology is shown to yield COT and CER consistent with those from the MODIS operational cloud product (MOD06) when forcing AOT to zero, while the full COT-CER-AOT retrievals that account for the above-cloud aerosol attenuation increase regional monthly mean COT and CER by up to 9% and 2%, respectively. Retrieved AOT is roughly 3 to 5 times larger than the collocated 532\u2009nm Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) retrievals, though closer agreement is observed with the CALIOP 1064\u2009nm retrievals, a result consistent with previous case study analyses. Regional cloudy-sky above-cloud aerosol DRE calculations are also performed that illustrate the importance of the aerosol model assumption and underlying cloud retrievals.",

Climate anomalies associated with the EAWM differ between extratropical and tropical regions due to the EAWM's meridional extent. Spatial differences in the EAWM variability on centennial and millennial time scales during the Holocene have not been well understood. This study describes Holocene spatiotemporal features of the EAWM based on comparisons of proxy records and climate simulations. The analysis specifically compared four proxy records located throughout China to assess the EAWM's spatial variability during the Holocene. These records indicate a stronger EAWM during the early Holocene than that during the late Holocene. The EAWM also shows a rapid, asynchronous decline from northwestern to southeastern China. The EAWM declined in northwestern China from 10 to 7.5\u2009ka B.P., whereas the decline did not occur in southern China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau until 6\u20134.5\u2009ka B.P. Coupled equilibrium and transient simulations of climate evolution during the Holocene indicate that the decline of the EAWM from 10 to 7.5\u2009ka B.P. was probably caused by melting of Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets and enhanced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The decline of the EAWM from 6 to 4.5\u2009ka B.P. over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and southern China is related to an abrupt increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the tropical western Indian Ocean. We therefore argue that the regional shift in EAWM intensity was probably related to a distinguishing response to high-latitude (NH ice sheets and AMOC) and low-latitude (tropical SSTs) forcings.",

In this paper 5\u2009years of radiative heating profiles derived from CloudSat radar and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation data are analyzed to document radiative heating anomalies during the MJO. Atmospheric shortwave absorption and surface longwave radiation anomalies are of opposite sign and 10\u201320% as large as top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies, confirming that OLR provides a useful estimate of the total column radiative heating anomaly. Positive anomalies generally peak about 1\u2009week before the MJO peak and are smallest over the Indian Ocean. Anomalies over the Maritime Continent are strongest and coincident with the MJO peak. Shortwave heating profile anomalies are weaker than longwave anomalies in the active region of the MJO but generally of opposite sign; thus, shortwave heating damps the longwave destabilization of the lower troposphere. The exception is the onset phase of the MJO, where shortwave and longwave heating anomalies due to thin cirrus are both positive in the upper troposphere and exert a stabilizing influence. Specific humidity anomalies in the middle troposphere reach 0.5\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121, but the associated clear-sky heating anomaly is small. Radiative enhancement of column moist static energy becomes significant as precipitation increases before the MJO peak and remains high after the MJO peak as precipitation begins to decline. Elevated radiative heating after the peak may contribute to destabilizing the MJO.",

Aerosol samples were collected at Cape Hedo, Okinawa Island, Japan, from October 2009 to February 2012 and analyzed for five primary saccharides and four sugar alcohols as PBAP tracers. We detected high levels of sucrose in spring when blossoming of plants happens and prolifically emits pollen to the air. Concentrations of glucose, fructose, and trehalose showed levels higher than the other saccharides in spring in 2010. In comparison, primary saccharide levels were mutually comparable in spring, summer, and autumn in 2011, indicating the interannual variability of their local production in subtropical forests, which is driven by local temperature and radiation. High trehalose events were found to be associated with Asian dust outflows, indicating that Asian dust also contributes to PBAPs at Okinawa. Sugar alcohols peaked in summer and correlated with local precipitation and temperature, indicating high microbial activities. Positive matrix factorization analysis confirmed that the PBAPs are mainly derived from local vegetation, pollen, and fungal spores. A higher contribution of PBAP tracers to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was found in summer (14.9%). The annual mean ambient loadings of fungal spores and PBAPs were estimated as 0.49\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123 and 4.12\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123, respectively, using the tracer method.

One of the unique features of this algorithm is using the ancillary parameters (i.e., surface type, surface temperature, land elevation, and ice layer thickness) to stratify the single database into many smaller but more homogeneous databases, in which both the surface condition and precipitation vertical structure are similar. It is found that the probability of detection (POD) increases about 8% and 12% by using stratified databases for rainfall and snowfall detection, respectively. In addition, by considering the relative humidity at lower troposphere and the vertical velocity at 700 hPa in the precipitation detection process, the POD for snowfall detection is further increased by 20.4% from 56.0% to 76.4%. The better result is evident in both ends of the retrieved rain rate when the stratified databases are used, especially when the rain rate is greater than 30 mm/h. Similarly, the retrieved snowfall rate using stratified databases also outperforms that using single database. The correlation between retrieved and observed rain rates from stratified databases is 0.63, while it is 0.42 using the single database. The root-mean-square error is reduced by 50.3% from 2.07 to 0.98 by using stratified databases. The retrieved snow rates from stratified database are also better correlated with observations and possess smaller root-mean-square error. Additionally, the precipitation overestimation from the single database over the western United States is largely mitigated when the stratified databases are utilized. It is further demonstrated that over the majority of the stratified databases, the relationship between precipitation rate and brightness temperature is much closer to that from the corresponding category in the validation databases, rather than that from the single database. Therefore, overall superior performance using the stratified databases for both the precipitation detection and retrieval is achieved.",

In the literature, the focus seems to have been on describing the complexity of spatiotemporal distribution of hydrological variables, but little attention has been paid to the study of complexity gradation, because the degree of absolute complexity of hydrological systems cannot be objectively evaluated. Here we show that complexity and predictability of hydrological processes can be graded into three ranks (low, middle, and high). The gradation is based on the difference in the energy distribution of hydrological series and that of white noise under multitemporal scales. It reflects different energy concentration levels and contents of deterministic components of the hydrological series in the three ranks. Higher energy concentration level reflects lower complexity and higher predictability, but scattered energy distribution being similar to white noise has the highest complexity and is almost unpredictable. We conclude that the three ranks (low, middle, and high) approximately correspond to deterministic, stochastic, and random hydrological systems, respectively. The result of complexity gradation can guide hydrological observations and modeling, and identification of similarity patterns among different hydrological systems.",

In order to obtain reliable estimates from eddy covariance (EC) measurements in such conditions, the current study aimed at proposing adequate planar fit tilt corrections that account for the combined effects of topography, wind direction, and vegetation height on airflow inclinations. EC measurements were collected within an agricultural hilly watershed in northeastern Tunisia, throughout the growth cycles of cereals, legumes, and pasture. The wind had two dominant directions that induced upslope and downslope winds. For upslope winds, the airflows were parallel to the slopes and slightly came closer to the horizontal plane when vegetation grew. For downslope winds, over fields located in the lee of the rim top, the airflows were almost horizontal over bare soil and came closer to the topographical slope when vegetation grew. We therefore adjusted the planar fit tilt correction on EC measurements according to vegetation height and by discriminating between upslope and downslope winds. This adjusted tilt correction improved the energy balance closure in most cases, and the obtained energy balance closures were similar to that reported in the literature for flat conditions. We conclude that EC data collected within crop fields on hilly slopes can be used for monitoring land surface fluxes, provided planar fit tilt corrections are applied in an appropriate manner.",

We developed herein an integrated modeling system with an energy budget-based multilayer scheme for clean glaciers, a single-layer scheme for debris-covered glaciers, and multilayer scheme for seasonal snow over glacier, soil, and forest within a distributed biosphere hydrological modeling framework. Model capability is demonstrated for Hunza River Basin (13,733\u2009km2) in the Karakoram region of Pakistan on a 500\u2009m grid for 3 hydrologic years (2002\u20132004). Discharge simulation results show good agreement with observations (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency\u2009=\u20090.93). Flow composition analysis reveals that the runoff regime is strongly controlled by the snow and glacier melt runoff (50% snowmelt and 33% glacier melt). Pixel-by-pixel evaluation of the simulated spatial distribution of snow-covered area against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived 8\u2009day maximum snow cover extent data indicates that the areal extent of snow cover is reproduced well, with average accuracy 84% and average absolute bias 7%. The 3\u2009year mean value of net mass balance (NMB) was estimated at +0.04\u2009myr\u22121. It is interesting that individual glaciers show similar characteristics of NMB over 3\u2009years, suggesting that both topography and glacier hypsometry play key roles in glacier mass balance.

This study presents a global climatology of tropopause folds using ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1979 to 2012 and a refined version of a previously developed 3-D labeling and fold identification algorithm. This algorithm objectively separates stratospheric and tropospheric air in complex situations, e.g., in regions with strong low-level inversions, and in extratropical cyclones where diabatically generated potential vorticity anomalies typically occur. Three classes of tropopause folds are defined (shallow, medium, and deep), and their geographical distribution, vertical extent, and seasonal cycle are investigated. Most shallow folds occur along the subtropical jet stream, in agreement with previous studies. Hot spots of medium and deep tropopause folds are found west of Australia and along the coast of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere and around the east coast of North America in the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal cycles show maxima in winter for all fold classes. Medium and deep folds are frequently associated with surface wind gust and precipitation extremes, as quantified for folds over the southern Indian Ocean. Wind gust extremes occur mainly in an elongated band upstream and equatorward of folds, whereas precipitation extremes occur mainly east and poleward of folds. Overall, in the considered region, about 20% of medium folds and 33% of deep folds are associated with surface wind or precipitation extremes in the vicinity of the fold.",

The uncertainty ranges in calculated N2O and CH4 global lifetimes computed using the SPARC estimated uncertainties are reduced by nearly a factor of 2 compared with uncertainties from Sander et al.

        "description": "\nThis study presents the outcome of an inverse modeling intercomparison experiment on the use of total column CO2 retrievals from Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT) for quantifying global sources and sinks of CO2. Eight research groups submitted inverse modeling results for the first year of GOSAT measurements. Inversions were carried out using only GOSAT data, a combination of GOSAT and surface measurements, and using only surface measurements. As expected, the most robust flux estimates are obtained at large scales (e.g., within 20% of the annual flux at the global scale), and they quickly diverge toward the scale of the subcontinental TRANSCOM regions and beyond (to >100% of the annual flux). We focus our analysis on a shift in the CO2 uptake over land from the Tropics toward the Northern Hemisphere Extra tropics of \u223c1 PgC/yr when GOSAT data are used in the inversions. This shift is largely driven by TRANSCOM regions Europe and Northern Africa, showing, respectively, an increased uptake and release of 0.7 and 0.9 PgC/yr. Inversions using GOSAT data show a reduced gradient between midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and the Tropics, consistent with the latitudinal shift in carbon uptake. However, the reduced gradients degrade the agreement with background aircraft and surface measurements. To narrow the range of inversion-derived flux, estimates will require further efforts to understand the differences not only between the retrieval schemes but also between inverse models, as their contributions to the overall uncertainty are estimated to be of similar magnitude.",

Seasonal changes in CCN are evident, with low magnitudes during autumn/winter, and high CCN during spring/summer accompanied with a characteristic westward decrease. CCN monthly evolution is consistent with satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentration Nd from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. One-point correlation (r) analysis between the 1000\u2009hPa zonal wind time series over a region between 125\u00b0W and 135\u00b0W, 35\u00b0N and 45\u00b0N, and the Nd field yields a negative r (up to \u22120.55) over a domain that covers a zonal extent of at least 20\u00b0 from the California shoreline, indicating that Nd decreases when the zonal wind intensifies. The negative r expands southwestward as the zonal wind precedes Nd by up to 3\u2009days, suggesting a transport mechanism from the coast of North America mediated by the California low-coastal jet, which intensifies in summer when the aerosol concentration and Nd reach a maximum. A first assessment of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) is performed by combining CCN and satellite Nd values from the Fifteenth Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The CCN-Nd correlation is 0.66\u20130.69, and the ACI metric defined as ACI\u2009=\u2009\u2202ln(Nd)/\u2202ln(CCN) is high at 0.9, similar to other aircraft-based studies and substantially greater than those inferred from satellites and climate models.",

The spaceborne lidar system, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe vertical distributions of global aerosol layers. In this study we examine the most probable height (MPH) of dust and smoke layers, which are calculated either from aerosol occurrence frequency (OF) in vertical feature mask or aerosol extinction profile. The study focuses on six high-aerosol-loading regions where aerosols are of great interest in a range of scientific topics: Saharan Air Layer (SAL) over Tropical Atlantic, West African Monsoon region (WAM), Southeast Atlantic Ocean (SAO), Southeast Asia (SEA) and South China Sea, Amazon (AMZ), and Northwestern Pacific (NWP). The analysis revealed interesting spatial and seasonal variability of different vertical mixture features over these regions: seasonal migration of dust layers over SAL, separation and mixture of dust and smoke layers over WAM and NWP, and smoke layer above clouds over SAO, SEA, and AMZ. Results also indicated that the OF-based MPH tends to be much higher than the aerosol optical depth (AOD)-based MPH, owing to the predominating near-surface sources. Within the same vertical resolution grid of CALIPSO, aerosols are found with higher OF at higher levels but AOD tends to increase toward lower levels, because most aerosol sources are near the surface and the aerosol layers transported to high altitudes are generally much more diluted over larger spatial domain than those near the surface.",

To examine multiscale dynamics' influences on ISS formation, we analyze in situ aircraft observations (~200\u2009m scale) over North America in coordinates relative to dynamical boundaries in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Two case studies demonstrate that ISS formation is likely influenced by mesoscale uplifting, small-scale waves, and turbulence. A collective analysis of 15 flights in April\u2013June 2008 shows that the top layers of ISS and ice crystal distributions are strongly associated with thermal tropopause height. In addition, the average occurrence frequencies of ISS and ice crystals on the anticyclonic side of the jet stream are ~1.5\u20132 times of those on the cyclonic side. By defining five cirrus evolution phases based on the spatial relationships between ice-supersaturated and in-cloud regions, we find that their peak occurrence frequencies are located at decreasing altitudes with respect to the thermal tropopause: (phase 1) clear-sky ISS around the tropopause, (phase 2) nucleation phase around 2\u2009km below the tropopause, (phases 3 and 4) early and later growth phases around 6\u2009km below the tropopause, and (phase 5) sedimentation/sublimation around 2\u20136\u2009km below the tropopause. Consistent with this result, chemical tracer correlation analysis shows that the majority (~80%) of the earlier cirrus phases (clear-sky ISS and nucleation) occurs inside the chemical tropopause transition layer, while the later phases happen mostly below that layer. These results shed light on the role of dynamical environment in facilitating cirrus cloud formation and evolution.",

By definition, detectable trends are those that are unlikely to have arisen from internal variability alone. To represent this internal variability, we use station-specific, seasonally varying, daily time scale stationary stochastic weather models\u2014models in which the simulated interannual-to-multidecadal precipitation variance is purely the result of the random evolution of daily precipitation events within a given time period\u2014to first estimate the trends in various means and extremes that can occur even with fixed, climatological daily precipitation characteristics. Detection of secular trends in the observed climate\u2014whether naturally or anthropogenically induced\u2014can then be defined relative to this stochastic variability, i.e., as trends in the means and/or extremes that are likely to have occurred only through a change in the underlying precipitation characteristics.

First, they identify \u201chot spot\u201d regions in which trends in precipitation characteristics are already emerging from within the envelope of stochastic variability, including (but not limited to) positive trends in annual occurrence across most of the U.S. and positive trends in annual intensity and heavy-event accumulations across the Interior Plains and around the Great Lakes. Further, they identify \u201csentinel\u201d metrics which show the greatest detectability\u2014e.g., annual precipitation occurrence and intensity\u2014as well as those which show the least detectability and hence are unlikely to produce any statistically meaningful signals\u2014e.g., seasonal total precipitation and extremes.",

For calculation of the surface shortwave net radiation budget, temporal mean albedo is more important than instantaneous albedo. Although Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo products have been extensively validated, little effort has been made to evaluate the accuracy of daily mean albedo from MODIS. In this study, we calculate daily mean albedo from MODIS data using a direct method and a look-up table (LUT) method. Comparison with in situ albedo measured at 27 field stations shows that both methods can estimate daily mean albedo with high accuracy. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of snow-free daily mean albedo retrieved by the LUT method and the direct method is 0.033 and 0.034, respectively. Over the 12 spatially representative stations, RMSE of daily mean albedo is 0.022 and 0.023 by the LUT and direct approach, respectively. Simply using the local noon albedo value as a surrogate of daily mean albedo leads to overestimation of daily shortwave net radiation. By using the data of daily mean albedo, the bias in estimating daily shortwave net radiation can be reduced by 2.8\u2009W/m2 with the direct method and 2.6\u2009W/m2 with the LUT method, compared to the use of local noon albedo.",

Fourteen CMIP3 models and 14 CMIP5 models were investigated over eight regions across China. Skill scores quantifying the match between the simulated and observed probability density functions (PDFs) were applied to evaluate the performance of the models. For daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, the results revealed that CMIP3 and CMIP5 models captured the basic pattern of the observed PDFs in all regions. However, the probabilities at lower values were overestimated in most models. In all regions except the west of Northwest China (region 7), all CMIP5 models captured more than 80% of the observed PDFs. Compared with performance at the annual time scale, the models tended to perform relatively worse over the period June to August. The performances of the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models were not as good for daily precipitation as for daily temperature, and the skill scores for precipitation were generally lower than 0.7 in all regions. The amount of drizzle (daily precipitation <\u20095\u2009mm) was overestimated notably in all regions. The amount of very heavy precipitation (daily precipitation \u2265\u200920\u2009mm) tended to be underestimated in humid regions but overestimated in arid regions.

Using ground-based radar and large-scale forcing data derived from a sounding array, typical profiles of environmental heating, moisture sink, vertical motion, moisture advection, and Eulerian moisture tendency are computed for periods prior to those during which deep convection is prevalent and those during which moderately deep cumulonimbi do not form into deep clouds. Convection with 3\u20137\u2009km tops is ubiquitous but present in greater numbers when tropospheric moistening occurs below 600\u2009hPa. Vertical eddy convergence of moisture in shallow to moderately deep clouds is likely responsible for moistening during a 3\u20137\u2009day long transition period between suppressed and active MJO conditions, although moistening via evaporation of cloud condensate detrained into the environment of such clouds may also be important. Reduction in large-scale subsidence, associated with a vertical velocity structure that travels with a dry eastward propagating zonal wavenumbers 1\u20131.5 structure in zonal wind, drives a steepening of the lapse rate below 700\u2009hPa, which supports an increase in moderately deep moist convection. As the moderately deep cumulonimbi moisten the lower troposphere, more deep convection develops, which itself moistens the upper troposphere. Reduction in large-scale subsidence associated with the eastward propagating feature reinforces the upper tropospheric moistening, helping to then rapidly make the environment conducive to formation of large stratiform precipitation regions, whose heating is critical for MJO maintenance.",

Building upon previous work in which we highlighted the role of the MP on the high-level westerly jet stream, the response of surface-level features of the Asian climate is examined in this study. The results show that the Indian and East Asian summer monsoonal and inland precipitation are mainly enhanced by the uplift of the TP. The precipitation during the onset of the summer monsoon is also intensified over India and eastern China. In addition, the East Asian monsoon domain is significantly expanded with the uplift of the TP, while the Indian summer monsoon domain does not change obviously. The MP plays a significant role in the strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon, which is larger than the TP. With the uplift of the MP, the cold northerly wind in winter intensifies significantly in East Asia from higher latitudes to the South China Sea. The Siberian high is also enhanced and moves remarkably northward to its modern location. The strengthening of the Asian winter monsoon is related to the MP-induced diversion of westerly wind. The bypassing flows around the plateau modify the temperature advections over middle latitudes and the atmosphere thermal structure in winter, which leads to the strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon.",

We compared the present data to field data reported by Kudo et al. (2014).

When EFs from the burning of wet samples were investigated, the consistency between the field and laboratory data for OVOCs was stronger than for dry samples. This may be caused by residual moisture in crop residue that has been stockpiled in humid regions. Comparison of the wet laboratory data with field data suggests that Kudo et al.

Using simulated Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) XCO2, we quantify the impact of inclusion (add-on) or exclusion of observations (data-denial) within a receptor region on flux inversion. We discuss the connections between the observation impact and the underlying source-receptor relationships. The strong sensitivity of XCO2 to nonlocal fluxes makes the XCO2 observations have strong impact on nonlocal flux estimation. On an annual mean, the impact of GOSAT XCO2 over Europe on North America flux estimation is 10%\u201339% of the full observation impact. Because the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude XCO2 are most sensitive to local and tropical fluxes, the mean impact of GOSAT XCO2 over Southern South America on Northern South America (N-S-America) flux estimation is 30%\u201359% of the full observation impact. Because of the strong sensitivity of the XCO2 over N-S-America to Central Africa (C-Africa) fluxes, the mean impact on C-Africa flux estimation is between 14% and 31% of the full observation impact in spite of the sparse observation coverage.

The back trajectory analyses indicate that aerosol samples collected in winter and spring are influenced by the East Asian outflow, whereas summer and fall samples are associated with the pristine maritime air masses. Molecular distributions of water-soluble organics in winter and spring samples show the predominance of oxalic acid (C2) followed by succinic (C4) and malonic acids (C3). In contrast, summer and fall marine aerosols are characterized by the predominance of C3 over C4. Concentrations of dicarboxylic acids were higher over the Sea of Japan than the North Pacific. With a lack of continental outflow, higher concentrations during early summer are ascribed to atmospheric oxidation of organic precursors associated with high biological activity in the North Pacific. This interpretation is further supported by the high abundances of azelaic acid, which is a photochemical oxidation product of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids, over the Bering Sea in early summer when surface waters are characterized by high biological productivity. We found higher ratios of oxalic acid to pyruvic and glyoxylic acids (C2/Pyr and C2/\u03c9C2) and glyoxal and methylglyoxal (C2/Gly and C2/MeGly) in summer and fall than in winter and spring, suggesting a production of C2 from the aqueous-phase oxidation of oceanic isoprene. In this study, dicarboxylic acids account for 0.7\u201338% of water-soluble organic carbon.",

        "description": "\n\nAimed at reducing deficiencies in representing the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) in general circulation models (GCMs), a global model evaluation project on vertical structure and physical processes of the MJO was coordinated. In this paper, results from the climate simulation component of this project are reported. It is shown that the MJO remains a great challenge in these latest generation GCMs. The systematic eastward propagation of the MJO is only well simulated in about one fourth of the total participating models. The observed vertical westward tilt with altitude of the MJO is well simulated in good MJO models but not in the poor ones. Damped Kelvin wave responses to the east of convection in the lower troposphere could be responsible for the missing MJO preconditioning process in these poor MJO models. Several process-oriented diagnostics were conducted to discriminate key processes for realistic MJO simulations. While large-scale rainfall partition and low-level mean zonal winds over the Indo-Pacific in a model are not found to be closely associated with its MJO skill, two metrics, including the low-level relative humidity difference between high- and low-rain events and seasonal mean gross moist stability, exhibit statistically significant correlations with the MJO performance. It is further indicated that increased cloud-radiative feedback tends to be associated with reduced amplitude of intraseasonal variability, which is incompatible with the radiative instability theory previously proposed for the MJO. Results in this study confirm that inclusion of air-sea interaction can lead to significant improvement in simulating the MJO.",

        "description": "\nMany theories for the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) focus on diabatic processes, particularly the evolution of vertical heating and moistening. Poor MJO performance in weather and climate models is often blamed on biases in these processes and their interactions with the large-scale circulation. We introduce one of the three components of a model evaluation project, which aims to connect MJO fidelity in models to their representations of several physical processes, focusing on diabatic heating and moistening. This component consists of 20\u2009day hindcasts, initialized daily during two MJO events in winter 2009\u20132010. The 13 models exhibit a range of skill: several have accurate forecasts to 20\u2009days lead, while others perform similarly to statistical models (8\u201311\u2009days). Models that maintain the observed MJO amplitude accurately predict propagation, but not vice versa. We find no link between hindcast fidelity and the precipitation-moisture relationship, in contrast to other recent studies. There is also no relationship between models' performance and the evolution of their diabatic heating profiles with rain rate. A more robust association emerges between models' fidelity and net moistening: the highest-skill models show a clear transition from low-level moistening for light rainfall to midlevel moistening at moderate rainfall and upper level moistening for heavy rainfall. The midlevel moistening, arising from both dynamics and physics, may be most important. Accurately representing many processes may be necessary but not sufficient for capturing the MJO, which suggests that models fail to predict the MJO for a broad range of reasons and limits the possibility of finding a panacea.",

Mixing diagram analysis was made for the horizontal flight data recorded at 1\u2009Hz and 40\u2009Hz. The dominant observed feature, a positive relationship between cloud droplet mean volume (V) and liquid water content (L), suggested occurrence of homogeneous mixing. On the other hand, estimation of the relevant scale parameters (i.e., transition length scale and transition scale number) consistently indicated inhomogeneous mixing. Importantly, the flight altitudes of the measurements were significantly below cloud top. We speculate that mixing of the entrained air near the cloud top may have indeed been inhomogeneous; but due to vertical circulation mixing, the correlation between V and L became positive at the measurement altitudes in midlevel of clouds, because during their descent, cloud droplets evaporate, faster in more diluted cloud parcels, leading to a positive correlation between V and L regardless of the mixing mechanism near the cloud top.",

A lead time of 12\u201336\u2009h is chosen to constrain the large-scale dynamics and thermodynamics to be close to observations while avoiding being too close to the initial spin-up of the models as they adjust to being driven from the Years of Tropical Convection (YOTC) analysis. A comparison of the vertical velocity and rainfall with the observations and YOTC analysis suggests that the phases of convection associated with the MJO are constrained in most models at this lead time although the rainfall in the suppressed phase is typically overestimated. Although the large-scale dynamics is reasonably constrained, moistening and heating profiles have large intermodel spread. In particular, there are large spreads in convective heating and moistening at midlevels during the transition to active convection. Radiative heating and cloud parameters have the largest relative spread across models at upper levels during the active phase. A detailed analysis of time step behavior shows that some models show strong intermittency in rainfall and differences in the precipitation and dynamics relationship between models. The wealth of model outputs archived during this project is a very valuable resource for model developers beyond the study of the MJO. In addition, the findings of this study can inform the design of process model experiments, and inform the priorities for field experiments and future observing systems.",

Some models display relatively higher or lower MJO fidelity in both initialized hindcasts and climate simulations, while others show considerable variations in fidelity between experiments. Fidelity in hindcasts and climate simulations are not meaningfully correlated. The analysis of each experiment led to the development of process-oriented diagnostics, some of which distinguished between GCMs with higher or lower fidelity in that experiment. We select the most discriminating diagnostics and apply them to data from all experiments, where possible, to determine if correlations with MJO fidelity hold across scales and GCM states. While normalized gross moist stability had a small but statistically significant correlation with MJO fidelity in climate simulations, we find no link with fidelity in medium-range hindcasts. Similarly, there is no association between time step to time step rainfall variability, identified from short hindcasts and fidelity in medium-range hindcasts or climate simulations. Two metrics that relate precipitation to free-tropospheric moisture\u2014the relative humidity for extreme daily precipitation and variations in the height and amplitude of moistening with rain rate\u2014successfully distinguish between higher-fidelity and lower fidelity GCMs in hindcasts and climate simulations.

The data analyzed are from measurements of air samples collected in specially fabricated flask packages at frequencies of days to months at 22 sites over continental North America and shipped back to Boulder, Colorado, for analysis. These measurements are calibrated relative to the CO2 World Meteorological Organization mole fraction scale. The climatologies of CO2 are compared to climatologies of CO, CH4, SF6, N2O (which are also measured from this sampling program), and winds to understand the dominant transport and chemical and biological processes driving changes in the spatial and temporal mole fractions of CO2 as air passes over continental North America. The measurements show that air masses coming off the Pacific on the west coast of North America are relatively homogeneous with altitude. As air masses flow eastward, the lower section from the surface to 4000 m above sea level (masl) becomes distinctly different from the 4000\u20138000 masl section of the column. This is due in part to the extent of the planetary boundary layer, which is directly impacted by continental sources and sinks, and to the vertical gradient in west-to-east wind speeds. The slowdown and southerly shift in winds at most sites during summer months amplify the summertime drawdown relative to what might be expected from local fluxes. This influence counteracts the dilution of summer time CO2 drawdown (known as the \u201crectifier effect\u201d) as well as changes the surface influence \u201cfootprint\u201d for each site. An early start to the summertime drawdown, a pronounced seasonal cycle in the column mean (500 to 8000 masl), and small vertical gradients in CO2, CO, CH4, SF6, and N2O at high-latitude western sites such as Poker Flat, Alaska, suggest recent influence of transport from southern latitudes and not local processes. This transport pathway provides a significant contribution to the large seasonal cycle observed in the high latitudes at all altitudes sampled. A sampling analysis of the NOAA/ESRL CarbonTracker model suggests that the average sampling resolution of 22\u2009days is sufficient to get a robust estimate of mean seasonal cycle of CO2 during this 10\u2009year period but insufficient to detect interannual variability in emissions over North America.",

Despite limited observational data, stable isotope tracers have been commonly used to constrain modern-to-ancient Andean atmospheric processes, as well as to reconstruct paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry histories. Here, we present isotopic compositions of precipitation (\u03b418Op and \u03b4Dp) from 11 micrometeorological stations located throughout the Bolivian Altiplano and along its eastern flank at ~21.5\u00b0S. We collected and isotopically analyzed 293 monthly bulk precipitation samples (August 2008 to April 2013). \u03b418Op values ranged from \u221228.0\u2030 to 9.6\u2030, with prominent seasonal cycles expressed at all stations. We observed a strong relationship between the \u03b418Op and elevation, though it varies widely in time and space. Constraints on air sourcing estimated from atmospheric back trajectory calculations indicate that continental-scale climate dynamics control the interannual variability in \u03b418Op, with upwind precipitation anomalies having the largest effect. The impact of precipitation anomalies in distant air source regions to the central Andes is in turn modulated by the Bolivian High. The importance of the Bolivian High is most clearly observed on the southern Bolivian Altiplano. However, monthly variability among Altiplano stations can exceed 10\u2030 in \u03b418Op on the plateau and cannot be explained by elevation or source variability, indicating a nontrivial role for local scale effects on short timescales. The strong influence of atmospheric circulation on central Andean \u03b418Op requires that paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies consider the role of South American atmospheric paleocirculation in their interpretation of stable isotopic values as proxies.",

Results show that increasing horizontal resolution does improve the summer precipitation simulation over most part of China especially in western China due to the more realistic description of the topography. However, the summer precipitation amount (PA) over eastern China characterized by monsoonal climates is much more underestimated in the finer resolution model. It is also noted that the improvement (deterioration) of the summer PA over western (eastern) China in BCC_CSM1.1\u2009m model is mainly due to the better (worse) simulation of the moderate and heavy precipitation relative to BCC_CSM1.1 model. In addition, increasing model horizontal resolution can significantly improve the convective precipitation simulation especially over western China but shows very limited improvement in the large-scale precipitation simulation. The much more underestimated summer PA over eastern China in BCC_CSM1.1\u2009m model relative to BCC_CSM1.1 model is due to the significantly reduced positive biases of the convective PA but few changes in the negative biases of the large-scale PA. Further mechanism analysis suggests that both the underestimated land-sea thermal contrast and the overestimated Western Pacific subtropical high result in much less northeastward water vapor transport and summer PA over eastern China in BCC_CSM1.1\u2009m model than in BCC_CSM1.1 model.",

Simulated river discharge was evaluated throughout the three largest river basins in Korea. The simulation results showed potential for river discharge modeling in the RCM framework. The model generally captured the seasonal and monthly variabilities, and the daily scale peaks. From the resolution sensitivity experiments, it was confirmed that high-resolution RCM enhances the reproducibility of river discharge; however, the lack of sophistication of the current river-routing scheme, which was originally developed for continental and macroscale application, mitigates taking advantage of enhanced resolution in river model.

The first modal Schumann resonance (SR) frequencies of the horizontal magnetic field components were found to increase by 0.1\u20130.2\u2009Hz during the X-ray burst. During the enhancement of the proton flux, the first modal frequency of the east-west magnetic field component decreases by approximately 0.6 Hz at most, while the variation in the north-south magnetic field component is less well defined. The mechanisms of the variations are simulated with a finite difference time domain technique by modeling the perturbed conductivity profile in the day-night asymmetric Earth-ionosphere cavity and modeling the global lightning source with the raw flash data measured by satellites. The simulated varying trends of the SR frequencies observed near the ground with the altitudes of the conductivity perturbations are nearly the same as those previously reported and are interpreted by the two characteristic height model first proposed by Greifinger and Greifinger. It is concluded that the SR frequencies increase for enhanced conductivity above the altitude of 60\u201370 km because of the lowered magnetic height and decrease for enhanced conductivity below this altitude due to the lowered electric height. This finding can explain the opposite behaviors of the SR frequencies during X-ray bursts and strong solar proton events (SPEs). The simulation model in this work proved to be effective, with the simulated shifts in the values of SR frequencies during X-ray bursts and SPEs being close to the practical measurements.",

Large diurnal and intraseasonal variations of PWV are observed during winter and premonsoon seasons. There is large interannual PWV variability during premonsoon, owing to frequent local convection and summer thunderstorms. During monsoon period, low interannual PWV variability is attributed to the persistent wind from the ocean which brings moisture to this coastal station. However, significant interannual humidity variability is seen at 2 to 6\u2009km altitude, which is linked to the monsoon strength over the station.

Ensembles of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project style simulations have been conducted with and without dust radiative impacts, to differentiate the influence of dust on the tropical rain belt. The analysis focuses on summer season. The results highlight the role of dust-induced responses in global- and regional-scale circulations in determining the strength and the latitudinal extent of the tropical rain belt. A significant response in the strength and position of the local Hadley circulation is predicted in response to meridionally asymmetric distribution of dust and the corresponding radiative effects. Significant responses are also found in regional circulation features such as African Easterly Jet and West African Monsoon circulation. Consistent with these dynamic responses at various scales, the tropical rain belt across MENA strengthens and shifts northward. Importantly, the summer precipitation over the semiarid strip south of Sahara, including Sahel, increases up to 20%. As this region is characterized by the \u201cSahel drought,\u201d the predicted precipitation sensitivity to the dust loading over this region has a wide range of socioeconomic implications.

Spatial and temporal mismatches were reduced by having the mobile laboratory sample in the same areas as the TES footprints. To examine how large heterogeneities in the NH3 surface mixing ratios may affect validation, a detailed spatial survey was performed within a single TES footprint around the overpass time. The TES total NH3 column above a single footprint showed excellent agreement with the in situ total column constructed from surface measurements with a difference of 2% (within the combined measurement uncertainties). The comparison was then extended to a TES transect of nine footprints where aircraft data (5\u201380\u2009ppbv) were available in a narrow spatiotemporal window (<10\u2009km, <1\u2009h). The TES total NH3 columns above the nine footprints agreed to within 6% of the in situ total columns derived from the aircraft-based measurements.

It is shown that, the preonset positive (negative) rainfall anomaly over northwest India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran is associated with decrease (increase) in ISMR, primarily in the months of June and July, which in turn affects the seasonal mean. ISMR in the months of June and July is also strongly linked with the preonset 2\u2009m air temperature over the same regions. The preonset rainfall/2\u2009m air temperature variability is linked with stationary Rossby wave response, which is clearly evident in the wave activity flux diagnostics. As the predictability of Indian summer monsoon relies mainly on the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the found link may further enhance our ability to predict the monsoon, particularly during a non-ENSO year.",

        "description": "\nThe immersion freezing behavior of droplets containing size-segregated, monodisperse feldspar particles was investigated. For all particle sizes investigated, a leveling off of the frozen droplet fraction was observed reaching a plateau within the heterogeneous freezing temperature regime (T >\u2212 38\u00b0C). The frozen fraction in the plateau region was proportional to the particle surface area. Based on these findings, an asymptotic value for ice active surface site density ns, which we named ns\u22c6, could be determined for the investigated feldspar sample. The comparison of these results with those of other studies not only elucidates the general feasibility of determining such an asymptotic value but also shows that the value of ns\u22c6 strongly depends on the method of the particle surface area determination. However, such an asymptotic value might be an important input parameter for atmospheric modeling applications. At least it shows that care should be taken when ns is extrapolated to lower or higher temperature.",

The measured water-soluble organics show pronounced latitudinal distributions with higher concentrations in the region of 30\u00b0N\u201345\u00b0N (average 63\u2009ng\u2009m\u22123) than 10\u00b0N\u201330\u00b0N (18\u2009ng\u2009m\u22123). Mass fraction of oxalic acid (C2) in total aliphatic diacids (\u03a3C2\u2013C12) showed higher values (72\u2009\u00b1\u200910%) in lower latitude (10\u00b0N\u201330\u00b0N) than that (56\u2009\u00b1\u200916%) in higher latitude (30\u00b0N\u201345\u00b0N), suggesting a photochemical production of C2 due to an increased insolation over the tropical WNP. A similar trend was found in other diagnostic ratios such as oxalic to succinic (C2/C4) and oxalic to glyoxylic acid (C2/\u03c9C2), which further corroborate an enhanced photochemical aging over the WNP. In addition, relative abundances of oxalic acid in total diacids showed a marked increase as a function of ambient temperature, supporting their photochemical production. Constantly low concentration ratios of adipic and phthalic acids relative to azelaic acid suggest a small contribution of anthropogenic sources and an importance of oceanic sources during the study period. Significant production of C2 through oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds emitted from the sea surface is also noteworthy, as inferred from the strong linear correlations among water-soluble organic carbon, methanesulphonic acid, and oxalic acid. Sea-to-air emission of unsaturated fatty acids also contributes to formation of diacids over the WNP.",

        "description": "\n\nFor a few decades, climate models are used to provide future scenarios of precipitation with increasingly higher spatial resolution. However, this resolution is not yet sufficient to describe efficiently what happens at local scale. Dynamical and statistical methods of downscaling have been developed and allow us to make the link between two levels of resolution and enable us to get values at a local scale based on large-scale information from global or regional climate models. Nevertheless, both the extreme behavior and the spatial structures are not well described by these downscaling methods. We propose a two-step methodology, called spatial hybrid downscaling (SHD), to solve this problem. The first step consists in applying a univariate (i.e., one-dimensional) statistical downscaling to link the high- and low-resolution variables at some given locations. Once this 1d-link is performed, a conditional simulation algorithm of max-stable processes adapted to the extremal t process enables us to get conditional distributions of extreme precipitation at any point of the region. An application is performed on precipitation data in the south of France where extreme (Cevenol) events have major impacts (e.g., floods). Different versions of the SHD approach are tested. Most of them show particularly good results regarding univariate and multivariate criteria and overcome classical downscaling techniques tested in comparison. Furthermore, these conclusions are robust to the choice of the 1d-link functions tested and to the choice of the conditioning points to drive the conditional local-scale simulations performed by the SHD approach.",

Recent experimental evidence has correlated IBPs to the initial development of lightning leaders inside the thundercloud. NBE wideband waveforms resemble classic IBPs in both amplitude and duration. Most NBEs are quite peculiar in the sense that very frequently they occur in isolation from other lightning processes. The remaining fraction, 16% of positive polarity NBEs, according to Wu et al. (2014), happens as the first event in an otherwise regular intracloud lightning discharge. These authors point out that the initiator type of NBEs has no difference with other NBEs that did not start lightning, except for the fact that they occur deeper inside the thunderstorm (i.e., at lower altitudes). In this paper, we propose a new physical mechanism to explain the source of both IBPs and NBEs. We propose that IBPs and NBEs are the electromagnetic transients associated with the sudden (i.e., stepwise) elongation of the initial negative leader extremity in the thunderstorm electric field. To demonstrate our hypothesis a novel computational/numerical model of the bidirectional lightning leader tree is developed, consisting of a generalization of electrostatic and transmission line approximations found in the literature. Finally, we show how the IBP and NBE waveform characteristics directly reflect the properties of the bidirectional lightning leader (such as step length, for example) and amplitude of the thunderstorm electric field.",

The turbulent fluxes and wind stress curl associated with 10 m wind patterns identified using the self-organizing map technique are investigated for 10 winters (1997\u20132007, November-December-January-February-March) in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-I) and a regional simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 50 km. Sensible heat flux differences between WRF and ERA-I are primarily due to differences in near-surface temperature, while latent heat flux differences are driven by both moisture and wind speed differences. The largest turbulent flux differences occur over the marginal ice zone where the fluxes in WRF are larger than in ERA-I due to specified sea ice thickness that influences the near-surface atmospheric temperature and moisture; WRF has larger magnitude wind stress curl over the Irminger Sea. Patterns of strong westerly tip jet with barrier flow are most likely to impact preconditioning and convection in the Irminger Sea compared to other manifestations of westerly tip jets, and easterly tip jets are expected to have localized ocean impacts south of Cape Farewell.",

Mean climatologies, interannual variabilities, and trends calculated by the Mann-Kendal method are analyzed during 1961\u20132013. The annual regional long-term mean surface RH is 55.3%, with a clear maximum in summer (66.4%) and minimum in winter (44.9%). Compared with observations, NCEP/NCAR overestimates RH in all seasons, especially in spring (18.2%) and winter (17.8%). Mean annual regional surface RH has decreased by \u22120.23%\u2009decade\u22121 and even more rapidly in summer (\u22120.60%\u2009decade\u22121) and autumn (\u22120.39%\u2009decade\u22121). The reduction of surface RH is also captured by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis at the surface, 400, 500, and 600\u2009hPa. A particularly sharp reduction of RH since the mid-1990s is evident in both data sets, in line with rapid warming over the plateau. This suggests that moisture supply to the plateau from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal is limited and that variability and trends of surface RH over the TP are not uniquely driven by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.",

Monthly mean values were homogenized, projected onto a grid, and subjected to principle component analysis, which identified two significantly different regions: North and South. Sunshine duration temporal evolution is presented, and possible reasons for differences between the two regions are discussed in the light of a comparison with the trends found in observations of total cloud cover and with results from two neighboring regions: the Alps and Spain. In addition, trends for irradiance records, estimated from sunshine duration records using the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m-Prescott formula, are presented too. The major feature of the trends, an increase in sunshine duration from the mid-1980s, was common to both northern and southern Italy; the decrease in the preceding 30 year period was not, as northern Italy had a lower rate of decrease than southern Italy. The few records available during the earliest period of the data set indicate that sunshine duration in Italy increased from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. The further steps needed to identify and quantify the mechanisms giving rise to the observed trends and to the reported regional differences in dimming and brightening are outlined.",

Anomalous global mean monthly variability in the net radiation is surprisingly large, often more than \u00b11\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, and arises mainly from clouds and transient weather systems. Relationships are strongest and positive between OLR and temperatures, especially over land for tropospheric temperatures, except in the deep tropics where high sea surface temperatures are associated with deep convection, high cold cloud tops and thus less OLR but also less ASR. Tropospheric vertically averaged temperatures (surface = 150\u2009hPa) are thus negatively correlated globally with net radiation (\u22120.57), implying 2.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 extra net radiation to space for 1\u00b0C increase in temperature. Water vapor is positively correlated with tropospheric temperatures and thus also negatively correlated with net radiation; however, when the temperature dependency of water vapor is statistically removed, a significant positive feedback between water vapor and net radiation is revealed globally with 0.87\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 less OLR to space per millimeter of total column water vapor. The regression coefficient between global RT and tropospheric temperature becomes \u22122.98\u2009W\u2009m\u22122\u2009K\u22121 if water vapor effects are removed, slightly less than expected from blackbody radiation (\u22123.2\u2009W\u2009m\u22122\u2009K\u22121), suggesting a positive feedback from clouds and other processes. Robust regional structures provide additional physical insights. The observational record is too short, weather noise too great, and forcing too small to make reliable estimates of climate sensitivity.",

        "description": "\n\nElectric field values measured inside thunderclouds have consistently been reported to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the value required for the conventional electrical breakdown of air. This result has made it difficult to explain how lightning frequently occurs in thunderclouds. A few different theories have been offered to explain the lightning initiation process, one of them being the theory of lightning initiation from hydrometeors. According to this theory, lightning can be initiated from electrical discharges originating around thundercloud water or ice particles in the measured thundercloud electric field. These particles, called hydrometeors, are believed to cause significant enhancement of the thundercloud electric field in their vicinity and then initiate streamers that are the precursor discharges for the hot lightning leader channel. Previously, Liu et al. (2012a) reported streamer formation from a model hydrometeor in an electric field value of half of the conventional breakdown threshold (Ek) for air. In this paper, we present modeling results for streamer formation in electric fields as low as one third of the breakdown threshold. According to our results, initiation of stable streamers from thundercloud hydrometeors in a 0.3Ek electric field is possible, only if enhanced ambient ionization levels (e.g., the ionization created by corona discharges around the same or other nearby hydrometeors) are present ahead of the streamer. The magnitude and distribution of this ambient density may be a determining factor on whether the streamer branches, recovers after the prebranching stage, or continues propagating stably. We investigate the streamer branching behavior and characteristics and test a theory that has recently been proposed to explain this phenomenon. We find that the geometry of the streamer head plays an important role in the streamer branching phenomena. The fast radial movement of the maximum streamer head curvature, combined with the slow reduction of the maximum curvature value, eventually leads the streamer head to branching. Finally, we compare our modeling results with laboratory experiments and realistic thundercloud conditions and discuss the implications of this study to lightning initiation and other lightning-related phenomena.",

It is important to understand how the climate change signal is modified in the RCM driven by GCM so that the simulated results can be accurately interpreted. This study compares the performance of a RCM and four driving GCMs in simulating precipitation over Africa and investigate how dynamically downscaled present and future climate from the regional model RegCM4.1 driven with four GCMs differ from those of the GCMs. In general, RegCM4.1 has a lower summer (June\u2013August) precipitation bias than the driving GCMs, increasing our confidence in their future projections. Despite uncertainty in future projections, RegCM4.1 shows decreased precipitation over Sahel regardless of which GCM is used to drive the RCM. RegCM4.1 shows an increased interannual variability of summer precipitation over Gulf of Guinea and Central Africa as compared to GCMs in both present-day climate and projected future climate scenarios. The mean annual cycle of precipitation differs between RCM and the driving GCM, in particular during the West African Monsoon (WAM). The WAM onset, peak, and retreat phases are more clearly defined in the RegCM4.1 than the four driving GCMs, where the WAM rainband shifts more southward. This paper highlights the uncertainties in dynamical downscaling for climate prediction, which are due to the inconsistencies in the physical packages between RCM and GCMs.",

Zonal mean zonal winds and wind shear observations are less prone to time varying biases. Together with a zonal mean reference temperature trend profile in the extratropics, the wind data can be used to estimate zonal mean temperature trends in the tropics using the thermal wind relationship. Earlier estimates using this approach for the periods 1970\u20132005 and 1979\u20132005 showed strong trend amplification in the tropical upper troposphere but also very large uncertainties because the latitude for the reference profile was chosen very far north and due to a lack of data in the tropics.\nBoth sources of uncertainties have been addressed by (i) using reference temperature profiles from homogenized radiosonde temperature data sets, (ii) using the new Global historical Radiosondes and Tracked Balloons Archive on standard pressure levels (GRASP) as data source that includes not only radiosondes but also pilot balloons, and (iii) more accurate vertical discretization and sampling of wind data. The new trend estimates are extended back to 1958 and are considerably less noisy. Trend amplification factors between 1.3 and 2.6 were found in the intervals 1979\u20132005 and 1958\u20132010, respectively, when using wind shear information.

By combining the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model (CLM) and vector vorticity equation cloud-resolving model (VVM), experiments are designed to understand the responses of diurnal convection to heterogeneous land surface forcings of various spatial scales and intensities. To delineate the land-atmosphere interactions, a two-step off-line approach is adopted. First, the CLM is driven by observational atmospheric forcing with different characteristic length scales and magnitudes. While the surface fluxes from the CLM show no significant difference in the domain-averaged values, their spatial distribution responds significantly to the precipitation heterogeneity. In the second step, the derived CLM surface fluxes are used to drive the VVM. Results show that the timing of precipitation accelerates with increasing magnitude of surface flux perturbation, while the mean and diurnal ranges of precipitation roughly remain the same. The larger perturbation magnitude enhances the boundary layer vertical kinetic energy, which advances the development of the boundary layer. On the other hand, the mean and diurnal ranges of precipitation increase significantly, and the timing of initial precipitation delays with increasing perturbation length scale. The inland breeze induced by the large patches of surface fluxes tends to enhance the mesoscale organization of deep convection, hence the stronger precipitation. The present results highlight the importance of taking heterogeneous land surface fluxes into consideration in future development of general circulation model convection parameterizations associated with land and atmosphere interactions.",

First, the GPCP data were adjusted to remove biases relative to the gauge data, with consideration of the differences between snowfall and rainfall, and of the gauge density. Then, a blended pentad precipitation field was constructed using the adjusted GPCP precipitation field and the differences between the gauge and adjusted GPCP precipitation fields (residual kriging). The skill of the algorithm is evaluated for three networks of sparse to medium gauge density, with the evaluation data set being much larger than the training data set. The results show that the algorithm produces better representation of pentad precipitation fields than the GPCP precipitation estimates or using the gauge data alone; it has smaller root-mean-square errors and higher correlation skill scores. This algorithm was used to produce the first blended pentad precipitation data set for the period of 1997\u20132007 for Canada (CanBP5dV1). It can be used for other regions around the world.",

While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1\u03c3 model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends.

        "description": "\nThis is a study of the usefulness of radio occultation (RO) data for intercomparing different microwave temperature (MWT) sounding instruments. The RO data used are from the Global Navigational Satellite System Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding on the Metop-A and B satellites. The MWT sounders investigated are the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A instruments on the satellites NOAA 15, 16, and 18 and Metop-A. We collocate RO and MWT data and then use these collocations to study various aspects of the MWT instruments. In addition, two different versions of the MWT data are compared: standard operational data (OPR) and the NOAA Integrated Microwave Intercalibration Approach data (IMICA). The time series of monthly mean differences shows that there are robust patterns for each satellite and data version, which mostly drift only slowly over time. The intersatellite spread, measured by the standard deviation of the yearly mean values by all satellites, is between 0.1 and 0.4\u2009K, depending on channel, with no significant differences between OPR and IMICA data. The only notable exception is Channel 8 of NOAA 16, which appears to have a time-varying offset of 0.5\u20131\u2009K relative to the other instruments. At this point it is not clear whether this deviation is real or a sampling artifact, so further study is needed. Due to the large number of collocations used, it is possible to also investigate the scene brightness and scan angle dependence of the MWT bias (relative to RO). First results of such an analysis are presented and discussed. Particularly, the investigation of the scan angle dependence is novel, since this bias pattern is difficult to assess without RO data. Further work is needed on these angular dependences, before conclusions are robust enough to include in data recalibration efforts, but our overall conclusion is that RO collocations are a powerful tool for intercomparing MWT sounders.",

We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60\u00b0N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)\u2014anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68% of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60\u00b0N in winter and 56% in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams\u2014AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60\u00b0N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.",

A cross-correlation analysis is performed between the lightning and maximum sustained wind variations, giving lag and lead times related to the peak linear correlation for each tropical cyclone. A previous study of 58 cyclones by Price et al. (2009) is reexamined using the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship database for the maximum sustained wind speeds of each tropical cyclone showing a moderate to strong correlation between lightning and wind variations. An 8\u2009year data set of 144 tropical cyclones are analyzed in the same way, with a 10\u00b0 square window, giving similar results to the smaller data set. Using a radial lightning collection window of < 500\u2009km, we confirm the general results of previous studies that lightning can be used on a \u223c1\u2009day timescale to predict the evolution of the winds in tropical cyclones. Investigation of different lightning collection window sizes indicates that the lightning lead times are highly dependent upon the window size. Smaller collection windows have modal lightning lead times of \u223c2.75 and 0 days, indicating that the lightning location inside the cyclone is as important as the total lightning variation. We have also performed a fixed time lag correlation which shows that preexisting knowledge of what time lag to use is needed in order to use this approach as a predictive tool.",

The concept of the strongest isentropic gradients of PV and wind is applied to mark a dynamically relevant PV boundary on every isentrope. An Eulerian algorithm is then used to identify streamers of this PV contour and a trajectory-based technique to study the exchange across this contour. The climatology of PV streamers reveals a seasonal cycle with a higher frequency in summer than in winter in both hemispheres on all isentropes. During winter, PV streamers are suppressed above 400\u2009K in line with the occurrence of polar vortices. Globally, the highest frequency of PV streamers is found between 380 and 420\u2009K over the eastern North Pacific in summer. Exchange trajectories associated with these PV streamers constitute important atmospheric transport pathways between the tropics and extratropics. In both hemispheres, PV streamers and their associated air mass exchange are controlled by the presence of monsoon anticyclones in summer and by RWB in the vicinity of jet splittings in winter. Cross-hemispheric transport is observed between 380 and 400\u2009K in the westerly ducts over the Pacific and Atlantic. Equatorward PV streamers are connected with a more frequent exchange than poleward PV streamers, indicating a more reversible poleward and irreversible equatorward RWB. The latter is often connected with a frequent breaking into PV cutoffs.",

The main objectives of this mission are to identify the horizontal distribution of TLEs and to solve the occurrence conditions determining the spatial distribution. JEM-GLIMS was successfully launched and started continuous nadir observations in 2012. The global distribution of the detected lightning events shows that most of the events occurred over continental regions in the local summer hemisphere. In some events, strong far-ultraviolet emissions have been simultaneously detected with N2 1P and 2P emissions by the spectrophotometers, which strongly suggest the occurrence of TLEs. Especially, in some of these events, no significant optical emission was measured by the narrowband filter camera, which suggests the occurrence of elves, not sprites. The VLF receiver also succeeded in detecting lightning whistlers, which show clear falling-tone frequency dispersion. Based on the optical data, the time delay from the detected lightning emission to the whistlers was identified as \u223c10\u2009ms, which can be reasonably explained by the wave propagation with the group velocity of whistlers. The VHF interferometer conducted the spaceborne interferometric observations and succeeded in detecting VHF pulses. We observed that the VHF pulses are likely to be excited by the lightning discharge possibly related with in-cloud discharges and measured with the JEM-GLIMS optical instruments. Thus, JEM-GLIMS provides the first full set of optical and electromagnetic data of lightning and TLEs obtained by nadir observations from space.",

The exact processes controlling the variability of precipitation isotopologue composition must therefore first be deciphered and understood. This study investigates how atmospheric convection affects the summer variability of \u03b418O in precipitation (\u03b418Op) and \u03b4D in water vapor (\u03b4Dv) at the daily scale. This is achieved using isotopic data from precipitation samples at Lhasa, isotopic measurements of water vapor retrieved from satellites (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), GOSAT) and atmospheric general circulation modeling. We reveal that both \u03b418Op and \u03b4Dv at Lhasa are well correlated with upstream convective activity, especially above northern India. First, during days of strong convection, northern India surface air contains large amounts of vapor with relatively low \u03b4Dv. Second, when this low-\u03b4Dv moisture is uplifted toward southern Tibet, this initial depletion in HDO is further amplified by Rayleigh distillation as the vapor moves over the Himalayan. The intraseasonal variability of the isotopologue composition of vapor and precipitation over the southern Tibetan Plateau results from these processes occurring during air mass transportation.",

The 8\u2009year (2007\u20132014) data of the temperature and IWC are used to extract the 5\u2009day planetary waves (PWs) with zonal wave numbers ranging from \u22121 to \u22123 (eastward propagating mode, E1\u2013E3), 0 (stationary mode, W0), and 1 to 3 (westward propagating mode, W1\u2013W3) in the polar stratosphere and mesosphere. The 5\u2009day PWs in temperature are stronger in the polar winter stratosphere and mesosphere and exhibit substantial interhemispheric asymmetry. The date-height distributions of the 5\u2009day waves coincide with those of the eastward jet in each hemisphere. This indicates that the 5\u2009day PWs might be generated from barotropic/baroclinic instability in the polar stratosphere. The relative strengths of 5\u2009day PWs decrease with increasing wave numbers. The E1 (W1) 5\u2009day PW is stronger than any other mode in the winter stratosphere and lower mesosphere (summer upper mesosphere). SOFIE temperature and IWC data are derived from simultaneous measurements in the same air column and thus provide a good opportunity to study the phase relationship between the 5\u2009day PWs in temperature and IWC. Our analyses show that the phase shifts of W1 5\u2009day PW in temperature relative to that in IWC have a mean of \u22122.0\u2009h (0.3\u2009h) with a standard deviation of 3.8\u2009h (4.2\u2009h) in the northern (southern) polar region. This indicates that the formation of the W1 5\u2009day PW in PMCs is controlled mainly by the W1 5\u2009day PW in temperature and influenced by other factors and is consistent with previous studies.",

When the EAWM is stronger than normal, significant negative SST anomalies form in the East Asian marginal seas and subtropical western North Pacific and persist from winter to the following spring. It is found that winter-spring SST anomalies in the Yellow Sea and the Japan Sea have a close association with the northern component of the EAWM variability, whereas the southern component has a large impact on SST changes in subtropical western North Pacific. The two components induce SST anomalies through both surface heat flux and oceanic advection changes. The surface latent heat flux is predominantly responsible for SST changes. The oceanic advection has a secondary contribution to the SST change in subtropical western North Pacific associated with the northern component and in the Japan Sea associated with the southern component. The surface latent heat flux anomalies associated with the northern component are induced through changes in both wind speed and sea-air humidity difference, and those associated with the southern component are induced mainly through changes in sea-air humidity difference north of 20\u00b0N. The SST anomalies induced by the northern component are mostly independent of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). While ENSO has a large effect on the SST anomalies in open oceanic regions, the southern component has a dominant contribution independent of ENSO to the SST anomalies in the marginal seas.",

Echo top heights exhibited a bimodal distribution wherein cumulonimbi of moderate height constituted a \u201ccongestus mode\u201d while vertically extensive cumulonimbus made up a \u201cdeep mode.\u201d An intraseasonal time scale dominated variability in these modes from October to January over much of the Indian Ocean. Over the Maritime Continent, there was no clear intraseasonal signal in convective echo top heights. Where the intraseasonal oscillation was detected, radar echoes evolved from being dominated by the congestus mode to being characterized by more deep mode convection on time scales of less than 1\u2009week. The areal coverage of congestus echoes began to increase 2\u20138\u2009days prior to the rise in area of deep echoes. These satellite-derived results confirm that the time scale for convective deepening seen at individual DYNAMO observational sites is consistent with that of convection on the large scale over the Indian Ocean. Intraseasonal variability of zonal wind, temperature, and humidity as depicted by reanalysis is also consistent with that derived from rawinsonde observations during DYNAMO. Thus, the gradual buildup of convection as depicted by recent versions of the \u201cdischarge-recharge\u201d hypothesis does not accurately describe evolutions of convection prior to MJO events observed during DYNAMO, although cloud moistening processes may still be relevant on time scales of 1\u2009week or less.",

This statistical model is based on a combination of appropriate meteorological parameters (convective parameter, moisture content, etc.) and synoptic weather types. The output of the model is a new index that estimates the potential of the atmosphere for hailstorm development, referred to as potential hail index. Validations with independent data sets confirm the reliability of the model results. For Germany, the logistic hail model applied to reanalysis data over the past decades shows a markedly north-to-south gradient with most of the potential hail days occurring in the south. Applied to an ensemble of seven regional climate model simulations, it is found that the potential for hail events will increase in the future (2021\u20132050) compared to the past (1971\u20132000), but only statistically significant in the northwest and south of Germany.",

Different metrics of AV are investigated, measuring aspects of precipitation where substantial AV can be expected in mountainous terrains: spatial pattern of mean precipitation, daily precipitation intensity distribution, and daily precipitation extremes tails. Comparison with a high-quality, fine-scale (5\u2009km) gridded observational data set shows substantial AV of RCM downscaling for all metrics selected, and results are mostly improved compared to the driving GCMs also when the RCM fields are upscaled at the scale of the GCM resolution. We also find consistent improvements in the high-resolution (0.11\u00b0) versus medium-resolution (0.44\u00b0) RCM simulations. Finally, we find that the RCM downscaling substantially modulates the GCM-produced precipitation change signal in future climate projections, particularly in terms of fine-scale spatial pattern associated with the complex topography of the region.

The temporal structures of the series are examined in terms of detecting and characterizing seasonal cycles, long-term trends, and changes in seasonality over time. A generalized additive modeling approach is used to ensure that the estimated structures are determined by the data, rather than by the constraints of any assumed mathematical form for the trends and seasonal cycle. Results indicate strong seasonality at all sites, the presence of long-term trends at 16 sites, and interactions between trend and seasonality (corresponding to changes in seasonality over time) at 13 sites. The most systematic change corresponds to a progressive deepening of the seasonal cycle (i.e., an ongoing decline in winter lightning flash counts) and is most noticeable across southern Australia (south of 30\u00b0S). These results are consistent with previous analyses that have detected decreasing atmospheric instability during the austral winter since the mid-1970s.

What is more, numerical weather prediction models are not very accurate in determining freezing drizzle, which creates uncertainty when forecasting this type of weather phenomenon. Therefore, it is essential to improve the forecast accuracy of these models for such phenomena to mitigate risks caused by unforeseen freezing drizzle events. On 5 February 2012, an episode of freezing drizzle took place in the Guadarrama Mountains, at the center of the Iberian Peninsula. This episode was preceded by weak snowfall. After the freezing drizzle, moderate snowfall was recorded in the study area. This event was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Through this analysis, we identified the meteorological factors at both synoptic scale and mesoscale that caused this episode. Wind perpendicular to an orographic barrier-generated updrafts and retention of moisture upwind, which caused orographic clouds to appear on the north side of the Guadarrama Mountains. Atmospheric stability prevented cloud formation at midlevels at the time of the freezing drizzle, which maintained cloud top temperatures warmer than \u221215\u00b0C during the episode. The entrance of moisture and instability at midlevels caused cloud top temperatures substantially colder than \u221215\u00b0C, which coincided with snow in the mountain range. Cloud top temperature and thickness control the efficiency of the glaciation process, thereby determining the type of precipitation at the surface. Freezing drizzle risk and in-cloud icing algorithms were developed with the aim of predicting similar events in the study area, which could mitigate impacts on human activities.",

TiMREX heavy rainfall events (>50\u2009mm\u2009d\u22121) are characterized by upstream low-level jets, unstable upstream conditions, and a nearly moist neutral stratification within the heavy rain region. Three heavy rainfall events (2, 5, and 16 June) have only weak to moderate convection and little lightning; e.g., less than 10% of their rainfall is associated with intense convective cells (maximum 40\u2009dBZ height\u2009>\u20098\u2009km). Polarimetric radar measurements indicate that large precipitation-size ice particles well above the freezing level (5\u2009km) are rare in these events. Their vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) decrease rapidly above the 0\u00b0C level but increase downward below that level. These VPRRs are believed to be associated with weak updrafts and active warm-rain collision and coalescence processes at low levels with raindrops falling through the updraft. In contrast, the 14 June heavy rainfall event is more intense, is ice-based, and exhibits continental characteristics; e.g., 60% of its rainfall is contributed by active thunderstorms (>10 flashes min\u22121). This and other intense storms (26 May and 13 June) have robust lightning (>500 strikes h\u22121) and pronounced radar reflectivity in the mixed-phase region, indicating strong updrafts and vigorous ice-based processes. Significant amounts of large graupel/small hail are present in the mixed-phase region of these events. Furthermore, their VPRRs decrease or stay constant downward below the freezing level.",

        "description": "\n\nProper dynamic equation constraints in data assimilation (DA) systems can help improve balance of analyzed atmospheric state. The formulation of ensemble-variational DA algorithms allows for easy incorporation of such constraints, but their impacts within such DA systems have been little studied. A dynamic constraint based on the steady momentum equations is incorporated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) hybrid ensemble-three-dimensional variational (3DVar) (En3DVar) DA system as a weak constraint. The constraint aims at improving the coupling and balance among wind and thermodynamic state variables, especially when few state variables are directly observed. The scheme is applied to the assimilation of radar T-TREC (Typhoon-Tracking Radar Echo by Correlation) winds at a convection-allowing resolution, for landfalling typhoon, Chanthu (2010), when it was within the range of a coastal radar. Parallel experiments using the 3DVar and En3DVar with and without the dynamic constraint are run to examine the impact of the constraint. The flow-dependent ensemble covariance used in En3DVar helps to update unobserved pressure and temperature fields in a dynamically more consistent way compared to the static covariance; the added dynamic constraint produces more accurate pressure within the typhoon. The pressure field improved by the dynamic constraint also leads to better temperature and moisture analyses within the variational minimization through flow-dependent cross covariance. En3DVar analysis with the dynamic constraint produces the best intensity forecast for the typhoon, in terms of the minimum sea level pressure and maximum surface wind speed. Additional sensitivity experiments examine the impact of the weight of the dynamic constraint.",

Nonparametric statistical tests applied to 14 well-studied, annually resolved proxy records identify two centuries roughly spanning the Medieval Climate Anomaly as characterized by increased spatial variability relative to the preinstrumental baseline climate, whereas two centuries spanning the Little Ice Age are characterized by decreased spatial variability. Analysis of the instrumental record similarly indicates that the late and middle twentieth century warm intervals are generally associated with increased spatial variability. In both proxy and instrumental records an overall relationship between the first two moments is identified as a weak but significant positive correlation between time series of the spatial mean and spatial standard deviation of temperature anomalies, indicating that warm and cold anomalies are respectively associated with increased and reduced spatial variability. Insomuch as these historical patterns of relatively heterogeneous warming as compared with cooling hold, they suggest that future warming will feature increased regional variability.",

        "description": "\n\nFor scientific and sustainable management of water resources, hydrologic and meteorologic data series need to be often extended. This paper proposes a hybrid approach, named WA-CM (wavelet analysis\u2013cloud model), for data series extension. Wavelet analysis has time-frequency localization features, known as \u201cmathematics microscope,\u201d that can decompose and reconstruct hydrologic and meteorologic series by wavelet transform. The cloud model is a mathematical representation of fuzziness and randomness and has strong robustness for uncertain data. The WA-CM approach first employs the wavelet transform to decompose the measured nonstationary series and then uses the cloud model to develop an extension model for each decomposition layer series. The final extension is obtained by summing the results of extension of each layer. Two kinds of meteorologic and hydrologic data sets with different characteristics and different influence of human activity from six (three pairs) representative stations are used to illustrate the WA-CM approach. The approach is also compared with four other methods, which are conventional correlation extension method, Kendall-Theil robust line method, artificial neural network method (back propagation, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function), and single cloud model method. To evaluate the model performance completely and thoroughly, five measures are used, which are relative error, mean relative error, standard deviation of relative error, root mean square error, and Thiel inequality coefficient. Results show that the WA-CM approach is effective, feasible, and accurate and is found to be better than other four methods compared. The theory employed and the approach developed here can be applied to extension of data in other areas as well.",

Lightning in TCs over the northwest Pacific is more likely to occur in weak storms at tropical depression (10.8\u201317.1\u2009m\u2009s\u22121) and tropical storm (17.2\u201324.4\u2009m\u2009s\u22121) intensity levels, in agreement with past studies of Atlantic hurricanes. The greatest lightning density (LD) in the inner core appears in storms undergoing an intensity change of 15\u201325\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 during the next 24\u2009h. Lightning is observed in all storm intensity change categories: rapid intensification (RI), average intensity change (AIC), and rapid weakening (RW). The differences in LD between RI and RW are largest in the inner core, and the LD for RI cases is larger than for RW cases in the inner core (0\u2013100\u2009km). Lightning activity there, rather than in the outer rainbands, may be a better indicator for RI prediction in northwest Pacific storms. There was a marked increase in the lightning density of inner core during the RI stage for Super Typhoon Rammasun (2008). Satellite data for this storm show that the RI stage had the highest cloud top height and coldest cloud top temperatures, with all the minimum black body temperature values being below 200\u2009K in the inner core.",

In particular, in the presence of deep convection, certain characteristics of the dual-wavelength reflectivity profiles cannot be explained with single scattering, whereas they are readily explained by multiple-scattering theory. Examples of such signatures are the absence of surface reflectivity peaks and anomalously small reflectivity slopes in the lower troposphere. These findings are relevant for DPR-based rainfall retrievals and stratiform/convective classification algorithms when dealing with deep convective regions. A path to refining the rainfall inversion problem is proposed by adopting a methodology based on a forward operator which accounts for multiple scattering. A retrieval algorithm based on this methodology is applied to a case study over Africa, and it is compared to the standard DPR products obtained with the at-launch version of the standard algorithms.",

Ellipsoids are expected to improve the accuracy of the retrieval of aerosol properties using remote sensing techniques, which are currently often based on oversimplified assumptions of spherical ash particles. Measurements of the single-scattering optical properties of ash particles from several volcanoes across the globe, including previously unpublished measurements from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and Puyehue volcanoes, are used to assess the performance of the ellipsoidal particle models. These comparisons between the measurements and the ellipsoidal particle model include consideration of the whole scattering matrix, as well as sensitivity studies on the point of view of the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) instrument. AATSR, which flew on the ENVISAT satellite, offers two viewing directions but no information on polarization, so usually only the phase function is relevant for interpreting its measurements. As expected, ensembles of ellipsoids are able to reproduce the observed scattering matrix more faithfully than spheres. Performance of ellipsoid ensembles depends on the distribution of particle shapes, which we tried to optimize. No single specific shape distribution could be found that would perform superiorly in all situations, but all of the best-fit ellipsoidal distributions, as well as the additionally tested equiprobable distribution, improved greatly over the performance of spheres. We conclude that an equiprobable shape distribution of ellipsoidal model particles is a relatively good, yet enticingly simple, approach for modeling volcanic ash single-scattering optical properties.",

Worldwide climatological maps of daily solar erythemal exposure derived from 10\u2009year (2004\u20132013) hourly grid point radiative transfer model calculations for both cloudless sky and cloudy sky serve as the database of PEREX.

Systematic differences between PEREX model data, ship-based data, and satellite-based daily erythemal exposure for all-sky conditions are only 1 to 3%, while short-term variations of cloudiness result in standard deviations of differences around 30%. Measured ratios between cloudless-sky erythemal radiation at vertical to horizontal incidence decrease with decreasing solar zenith angle, while clouds flatten their diurnal course.",

        "description": "\n\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieves cloud droplet effective radius (re) and optical thickness (\u03c4) by projecting observed cloud reflectances onto a precomputed look-up table (LUT). When observations fall outside of the LUT, the retrieval is considered \u201cfailed\u201d because no combination of \u03c4 and re within the LUT can explain the observed cloud reflectances. In this study, the frequency and potential causes of failed MODIS retrievals for marine liquid phase (MLP) clouds are analyzed based on 1\u2009year of Aqua MODIS Collection 6 products and collocated CALIOP and CloudSat observations. The retrieval based on the 0.86\u2009\u00b5m and 2.1\u2009\u00b5m MODIS channel combination has an overall failure rate of about 16% (10% for the 0.86\u2009\u00b5m and 3.7\u2009\u00b5m combination). The failure rates are lower over stratocumulus regimes and higher over the broken trade wind cumulus regimes. The leading type of failure is the \u201cre too large\u201d failure accounting for 60%\u201385% of all failed retrievals. The rest is mostly due to the \u201cre too small\u201d or \u03c4 retrieval failures. Enhanced retrieval failure rates are found when MLP cloud pixels are partially cloudy or have high subpixel inhomogeneity, are located at special Sun-satellite viewing geometries such as sunglint, large viewing or solar zenith angles, or cloudbow and glory angles, or are subject to cloud masking, cloud overlapping, and/or cloud phase retrieval issues. The majority (more than 84%) of failed retrievals along the CALIPSO track can be attributed to at least one or more of these potential reasons. The collocated CloudSat radar reflectivity observations reveal that the remaining failed retrievals are often precipitating. It remains an open question whether the extremely large re values observed in these clouds are the consequence of true cloud microphysics or still due to artifacts not included in this study.",

BB emits specific organic tracers such as levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan, which are produced by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose and then transported downwind to the western North Pacific by westerly winds. Here we present long-term observations of BB tracers over the remote Chichijima Island in the western North Pacific (WNP) from 2001 to 2013. Elevated concentrations of BB tracers by an order of magnitude were found in midautumn to midspring with winter maxima, which are strongly involved with the atmospheric transport by westerly winds from the Asian continent to the WNP, as supported by backward trajectory analyses. Throughout the observations, we found an increase in the averaged concentrations of BB tracers from 2006 to 2013, which is mainly caused by enhanced BB events in Asian urban and rural areas, as supported by enhanced fire/hot spots in East Asia via satellite images. We also found that the period of the high concentrations was prolonged from 2006 to 2013. Comparison between monthly averaged concentrations of BB tracers and backward air mass trajectories clearly demonstrates that the winter/spring maxima over Chichijima are involved with the seasonal shifting of atmospheric circulation followed by downwind transport of BB aerosols to the WNP. High abundances of BB tracers over the WNP indicate that BB-laden air masses can be transported to remote marine environments.",

        "description": "\n\nSecondary organic aerosols (SOA) are large contributors to fine-particle loadings and radiative forcing but are often represented crudely in global models. We have implemented three new detailed SOA treatments within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) that allow us to compare the semivolatile versus nonvolatile SOA treatments (based on some of the latest experimental findings) and to investigate the effects of gas-phase fragmentation reactions. The new treatments also track SOA from biomass burning and biofuel, fossil fuel, and biogenic sources. For semivolatile SOA treatments, fragmentation reactions decrease the simulated annual global SOA burden from 7.5 Tg to 1.8 Tg. For the nonvolatile SOA treatment with fragmentation, the burden is 3.1 Tg. Larger differences between nonvolatile and semivolatile SOA (up to a factor of 5) exist in areas of continental outflow over the oceans. According to comparisons with observations from global surface Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements and the U.S. Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network measurements, the FragNVSOA treatment, which treats SOA as nonvolatile and includes gas-phase fragmentation reactions, agrees best at rural locations. Urban SOA is underpredicted, but this may be due to the coarse model resolution. All three revised treatments show much better agreement with aircraft measurements of organic aerosols (OA) over the North American Arctic and sub-Arctic in spring and summer, compared to the standard CAM5 formulation. This is mainly due to the oxidation of SOA precursor gases from biomass burning, not included in standard CAM5, and long-range transport of biomass burning OA at high altitudes. The revised model configurations that include fragmentation (both semivolatile and nonvolatile SOA) show much better agreement with MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) aerosol optical depth data over regions dominated by biomass burning during the summer compared to standard CAM5, and predict biomass burning and biofuel as the largest global source of OA, followed by biogenic and fossil fuel sources. The large contribution of biomass burning OA in the revised treatments is supported by these measurements, but the emissions and aging of SOA precursors and POA are uncertain, and need further investigation. The nonvolatile and semivolatile configurations with fragmentation predict the direct radiative forcing of SOA as \u22120.5\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and \u22120.26\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 respectively, at top of the atmosphere, which are higher than previously estimated by most models, but in reasonable agreement with a recent constrained modeling study.

The geographical and seasonal variations of these cloud properties for each cloud type are also analyzed. The cloud water content (CWC) of each cloud type is sorted by three parameters obtained from colocated satellite observations to investigate the relationships between large-scale conditions and the vertical structure of clouds. Results show that different cloud types have different altitudes of CWC and CFR peaks, and the altitude of CFR peak does not always overlap with that of CWC peak. Each type of cloud shows a clear asymmetric pattern of spatial distribution between Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Stratocumulus and stratus clouds make the greatest contribution to the liquid water path, while the ice water path is mostly contributed by deep convective cloud over the tropics and nimbostratus over the middle and high latitudes. Over both middle and high latitudes, clouds have larger seasonal variation in the NH than in the SH. Over ocean, large CWCs of deep convective cloud, cirrus, and altostratus are above 7 km, and are associated with high convective available potential energy (>2000\u2009J/kg), warm sea surface temperature (>303 K), and relatively high precipitation (>1\u2009mm/h).

Simulation results show that the coagulation mixing process tends to decrease aerosol mass, surface area, and number concentrations over the dust source areas. Over the downwind oceanic areas, aerosol concentrations generally increased due to enhanced sedimentation as particles became larger upon coagulation. The mixture process can reduce the overall single-scattering albedo by up to 10% as a result of enhanced core with shell absorption by dust and reduction in the number of scattering particles. The enhanced dry deposition speed also altered the vertical distribution. In addition, the ability of aerosol particles to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) increased from around 107\u2009m\u22123 to above 109\u2009m\u22123 over downwind areas because a large amount of mineral dust particles became effective CCN with solute coating, except over the highly polluted areas where multiple collections of hygroscopic particles by dust in effect reduced CCN number. This CCN effect is much stronger for coagulation mixing than by the uptake of sulfuric acid gas on dust, although the nitric acid gas uptake was not investigated. The ability of dust particles to serve as ice nuclei may decrease or increase at low or high subzero temperatures, respectively, due to the switching from deposition nucleation to immersion freezing or haze freezing.",

In this UQ framework, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) ground-based observations, which are the inputs for the cloud retrieval studied here. The principal components (PCs) in the EOF expansion are parameterized as random input variables, and hence, the input dimension is greatly reduced (up to a factor of 50), allowing large ensemble of random samplings. The EOF expansion improves the accuracy of the uncertainty estimation by taking into account the cross correlations in the input data profiles. This method enables a probabilistic representation of a retrieval process by adding normally distributed perturbations into PCs of sample means of input data profiles within a time window. Therefore, it effectively facilitates objective validation of climate models against cloud retrievals under a probabilistic framework for rigorous statistical inferences. Moreover, the variance-based global sensitivity index analysis, part of this method, attributes the output uncertainties to each individual source, thus providing directions for improving retrieval algorithms and observation strategies. For demonstration, we apply this method to quantify the uncertainties of the ARM program's baseline cloud retrieval algorithm for an ice cloud case observed at the Southern Great Plains site on 9 March 2000.",

However, validating satellite aerosol-type retrievals is more challenging than testing AOD results, because aerosol type is a more complex quantity, and ground truth data are far less numerous and generally not as robust. We evaluate the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) Version 22 aerosol-type retrievals by assessing product self-consistency on a regional basis and by making comparisons with general expectation and with the Aerosol Robotic Network aerosol-type climatology, as available. The results confirm and add detail to the observation that aerosol-type discrimination improves dramatically where midvisible AOD exceeds about 0.15 or 0.2. When the aerosol-type information content of the observations is relatively low, increased scattering-angle range improves particle-type sensitivity. The MISR standard, operational product discriminates among small, medium, and large particles and exhibits qualitative sensitivity to single-scattering albedo (SSA) under good aerosol-type retrieval conditions, providing a categorical aerosol-type classification. MISR \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent deviates systematically from ground truth where particle types missing from the algorithm climatology are present, or where cloud contamination is likely to occur, and SSA tends to be overestimated where absorbing particles are found. We determined that the number of mixtures passing the algorithm acceptance criteria (#SuccMix) represents aerosol-type retrieval quality effectively, providing a useful aerosol-type quality flag.",

        "description": "\n\nPrimary marine aerosol (PMA)-cloud interactions off the coast of California were investigated using observations of marine aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and stratocumulus clouds during the Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) and the Stratocumulus Observations of Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets (SOLEDAD) studies. Based on recently reported measurements of PMA size distributions, a constrained lognormal-mode-fitting procedure was devised to isolate PMA number size distributions from total aerosol size distributions and applied to E-PEACE measurements. During the 12 day E-PEACE cruise on the R/V Point Sur, PMA typically contributed less than 15% of total particle concentrations. PMA number concentrations averaged 12 cm\u22123 during a relatively calmer period (average wind speed 12\u2009m/s1) lasting 8 days, and 71\u2009cm\u22123 during a period of higher wind speeds (average 16\u2009m/s1) lasting 5 days. On average, PMA contributed less than 10% of total CCN at supersaturations up to 0.9% during the calmer period; however, during the higher wind speed period, PMA comprised 5\u201363% of CCN (average 16\u201328%) at supersaturations less than 0.3%. Sea salt was measured directly in the dried residuals of cloud droplets during the SOLEDAD study. The mass fractions of sea salt in the residuals averaged 12 to 24% during three cloud events. Comparing the marine stratocumulus clouds sampled in the two campaigns, measured peak supersaturations were 0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04% during E-PEACE and 0.05\u20130.1% during SOLEDAD. The available measurements show that cloud droplet number concentrations increased with >100 nm particles in E-PEACE but decreased in the three SOLEDAD cloud events.",

Convective available potential energy (CAPE), aerosol optical depth, midlevel vertical velocity, and tropospheric deep shear are all used to characterize the environment. The sensitivity of various aspects of convective morphology to each one of these environmental quantities is assessed individually. The results demonstrate that clouds tend to be invigorated by higher CAPE, aerosol, and upward midlevel vertical velocity. Stronger shear tends to make clouds wider but also shallower. The relative importance of each of these and some additional environmental measures to trends in cloud morphology are compared. It is found that aerosol, deep-layer shear, and sea surface temperature tend to be the most influential environmental factors to convective morphology. The results are shown to be insensitive to the manner in which the environmental characteristics are defined. The potentially surprising weak sensitivity of cloud morphology to CAPE is discussed in detail.",

        "description": "\n7Be and 210Pb, two atmospherically delivered radionuclides, have been broadly applied to study the processes including air mass transport, soil erosion, and particle cycling in aqueous systems. These studies require temporal variations of their depositional fluxes. In the present work, monthly atmospheric bulk depositional fluxes of 7Be and 210Pb were measured over 8\u2009years (December 2005 to December 2013) at Shanghai, China. The bulk depositional fluxes of 7Be and 210Pb varied from 17.9 to 421\u2009Bq\u2009m\u22122\u2009month\u22121 and 6.8 to 82.1\u2009Bq\u2009m\u22122\u2009month\u22121, respectively. The volume-weighted activities ranged from 0.20 to 8.06\u2009Bq\u2009L\u22121 for 7Be and 0.05 to 3.40\u2009Bq\u2009L\u22121 for 210Pb. There were strong seasonal variations in the depositional fluxes of these nuclides. The seasonal fraction of depositional fluxes was >30% of the total annual depositional fluxes of 210Pb in winter and 7Be in spring. The lowest depositional fluxes were found in summer for both radionuclides, with precipitation-normalized enrichment factor (\u03b1) values of <1.0. The results from the synthesis of global fallout data indicate that there are latitudinal variations in the maximum depositional fluxes and volume-weighted activities of 7Be, both values increase with latitude from the equator to the midlatitudes. The 210Pb depositional fluxes increase with the distance from the coast in inland regions (distance from the coast >50\u2009km) and increase with the amount of precipitation in onshore region (distance from the coast \u226450\u2009km). We also report that Shanghai, China, has the second highest bulk depositional fluxes of 210Pb in literature.",

        "description": "\n\nThe urban land surface has a significant impact on local urban heat island effects and air quality. In addition, it influences the atmospheric conditions and air quality in the downwind cities. In this study, the impact of Shanghai urban land surface forcing on weather conditions and air quality over Kunshan was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a multilayer urban canopy model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model. Two simulations were conducted to identify the impact of upstream effects with and without upstream urban land surfaces in control and sensitivity experiments. The results show that the near-surface temperature and boundary layer height over Kunshan increased significantly with the appearance of the upstream urban land surface. Horizontal transport of O3 and its precursors, from Shanghai to Kunshan, are suppressed in the lower boundary layer but are strengthened in the upper boundary layer because of strong urban heat island circulation. As a result, O3 chemical production is decreased in the lower boundary layer of Kunshan but is increased in the upper boundary layer. On average, daytime O3 concentrations over Kunshan are decreased by approximately 2\u2009ppbv in the lower boundary layer but are increased by as much as 40\u2009ppbv in the upper air.",

Emissions were estimated at monthly resolution from 2000 to 2011. A posteriori, the total emission for East Asia increased from 43\u2009\u00b1\u20094 to 59\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 between 2000 and 2011, owing largely to the increase in emissions from China, from 39\u2009\u00b1\u20094 to 54\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121, while emissions in other East Asian countries remained relatively stable. For China, South Korea, and Japan, the total emissions were smaller than the prior estimates (i.e., Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research 4.2 FT2010 for anthropogenic emissions) by an average of 29%, 20%, and 23%, respectively. For Mongolia, Taiwan, and North Korea, the total emission was less than 2\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 and was not significantly different from the prior. The largest reductions in emissions, compared to the prior, occurred in summer in regions important for rice agriculture suggesting that this source is overestimated in the prior. Furthermore, an analysis of the isotope data suggests that the prior underestimates emissions from landfills and ruminant animals for winter 2010 to spring 2011 (no data available for other times). The inversion also found a lower average emission trend for China, 1.2\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 compared to 2.8\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 in the prior. This trend was not constant, however, and increased significantly after 2005, up to 2.0\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121. Overall, the changes in emissions from China explain up to 40% of the increase in global emissions in the 2000s.",

The Rocky Mountain Atmospheric Nitrogen and Sulfur Study Part II (RoMANS II) campaign was conducted from November 2008 to November 2009 to characterize the composition of reactive nitrogen and sulfur deposited in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). RoMANS II identified reduced nitrogen as the major contributor to reactive nitrogen deposition in RMNP, making up over 50% of the total. Motivated by this finding, the particulate source apportionment technology within the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions was used here to estimate source apportionment of reduced nitrogen concentrations at RMNP. Source apportionment results suggest that approximately 40% of reduced nitrogen deposition to RMNP comes from ammonia sources within Colorado. However, the model evaluation also suggests that this number could be underrepresenting ammonia sources in eastern Colorado due to the difficulty of capturing upslope airflow on the eastern side of the Continental Divide with meteorological models. Emissions from California, the western model boundary, and the Snake River Valley in Idaho, the next three most influential sources, contribute approximately 15%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, to total reduced nitrogen measured in RMNP. Within Colorado, about 61%, 26%, and 13% of the total Colorado contribution comes from sources to the east of the Continental Divide, sources to the west of the Continental Divide, and from the park itself.",

        "description": "\nEthanol made from corn now constitutes approximately 10% of the fuel used in gasoline vehicles in the U.S. The ethanol is produced in over 200 fuel ethanol refineries across the nation. We report airborne measurements downwind from Decatur, Illinois, where the third largest fuel ethanol refinery in the U.S. is located. Estimated emissions are compared with the total point source emissions in Decatur according to the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI-2011), in which the fuel ethanol refinery represents 68.0% of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 50.5% of nitrogen oxides (NOx\u2009=\u2009NO\u2009+\u2009NO2), 67.2% of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and 95.9% of ethanol emissions. Emissions of SO2 and NOx from Decatur agreed with NEI-2011, but emissions of several VOCs were underestimated by factors of 5 (total VOCs) to 30 (ethanol). By combining the NEI-2011 with fuel ethanol production numbers from the Renewable Fuels Association, we calculate emission intensities, defined as the emissions per ethanol mass produced. Emission intensities of SO2 and NOx are higher for plants that use coal as an energy source, including the refinery in Decatur. By comparing with fuel-based emission factors, we find that fuel ethanol refineries have lower NOx, similar VOC, and higher SO2 emissions than from the use of this fuel in vehicles. The VOC emissions from refining could be higher than from vehicles, if the underestimated emissions in NEI-2011 downwind from Decatur extend to other fuel ethanol refineries. Finally, chemical transformations of the emissions from Decatur were observed, including formation of new particles, nitric acid, peroxyacyl nitrates, aldehydes, ozone, and sulfate aerosol.",

        "description": "\n\nInvestigation of isotope effects in ozone (O3) photolysis and its contribution to the overall ozone isotope composition is difficult since photolysis always leads to secondary O3 formation and O3 decomposition by reactions with O(3P). Here we use a large excess of carbon monoxide (CO) as O(3P) quencher to suppress O(3P)\u2009+\u2009O3. This allows disentangling the isotope effects in photolysis and chemical removal when the data are evaluated with a kinetic model. The largest systematic uncertainty arises from an unidentified O3 removal reaction, which is responsible for an unaccounted 20% of the total removal rate. Assuming no isotope fractionation in this reaction, we find 18\u03b5O3+h\u03bd\u2009=\u2009(16J/18J\u2009\u2212\u20091)\u2009=\u2009\u221216.1 (\u00b11.4)\u2030 and 17\u03b5O3+h\u03bd\u2009=\u2009\u22128.05 (\u00b10.7)\u2030 for O3 photolysis and 18\u03b5O+O3\u2009=\u2009(16k/18k\u2009\u2212\u20091)\u2009=\u2009\u221211.9 (\u00b11.4)\u2030 and 17\u03b5O+O3\u2009=\u2009\u22125.95 (\u00b10.7)\u2030 for chemical removal via O(3P)\u2009+\u2009O3. Allowing for isotope fractionation in the unidentified reaction results in lower fractionation values for photolysis and higher fractionations for chemical removal. Several fractionation scenarios are examined, which constrain the fractionation in photolysis to 18\u03b5O3+h\u03bd\u2009>\u2009\u22129.4\u2030 and 17\u03b5O3+h\u03bd\u2009>\u2009\u22124.7\u2030 and in the chemical removal to 18\u03b5O+O3\u2009<\u2009\u221218.6\u2030 and 17\u03b5O+O3\u2009<\u2009\u22129.3\u2030. Both fractionations are thus significant and of similar magnitude. Because our measurements are dominated by photolysis in the peak region of the Chappuis band, isotope fractionation of atmospheric O3 by visible photons should also be in the same range. The isotope fractionation factor for O\u2009+\u2009O3 directly bears on ozone chemistry in the lower thermosphere.",
