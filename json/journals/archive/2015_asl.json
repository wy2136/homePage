        "description": "\n\nUnder global warming, cold winters over Northern Asia are highly correlated with the subsequent hot summers over middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (MLYRV). This high correlation may result from an oceanic bridge's effect in the Western Pacific. The mechanism may be described as follows: the atmospheric circulation anomalies of cold winters corresponds with a simultaneous warmer Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) by decreasing surface latent heat fluxes. The warmer sea surface temperature (SST) can persist and move eastward gradually to the subsequent summer through the oceanic processes, and thus in turn affect the hot days (HDs) over MLYRV.\n",

        "description": "\n\nBy studying three heavy rainfall events that were accompanied by debris flows in southwestern China, we find that 24-h accumulated rainfall is most sensitive to the initial temperature. The sensitivities to wind, surface pressure, and specific humidity are generally smaller. Moreover, the upper levels of the atmosphere are identified as the sensitive levels, and the sensitive areas are the areas with heavy rainfall. These results suggest that local temperature perturbations in the upper levels are a signal of short-term heavy rainfall in southwestern China. A validation experiment is carried out to justify the sensitivity results. The possible reasons are discussed and analyzed.\n",

For sites over complex, forested terrain a single PF may not account for complex variations in slope and canopy cover with wind direction.

Construction of large-area plastic greenhouse potentially changes the physical and radiative properties of the surface and its albedo, thereby potentially affecting the surface energy budget and climate change. This study aims to investigate the effect of the plastic-film cover on surface albedo based on computations with a simplified model and several field observation experiments. The results showed that surface albedo increased by \u223c23.5 and \u223c33.9% on clear and overcast days, respectively, if grassland was covered by plastic film. Surface albedo of bare soil covered by plastic film increased by \u223c16.6% under clear sky conditions. A larger increase in surface albedo was derived for surface types with smaller surface albedo.

An asymmetry in magnitude of the two eddies is observed with the anticyclonic eddy attaining greater magnitude.

Hence, it is important to understand the possible factors that influence the structure and size of SE. Idealized simulations suggest that the environmental humidity is one of the key factors. It is favorable for TC to establish a SE in a moist environment. Furthermore, the SE is likely to be located at a larger radius, thereby leads to a wider moat area. Consequently, the structure of SE would affect TC intensity change during the eyewall replacement cycle. This study strongly motivates further researches with respect to how the environmental conditions influence the storm dynamics and thermodynamics.\n",

The phasing and amplitude of monthly rainfall evolution and the spatial progression of the wet season onset are well simulated by the models. Notwithstanding some systematic biases in a few models, the simulated onset and end of the rainy season and their interannual variability are highly correlated with those computed from the reference data. The strongest agreements between the reference and modelled precipitation patterns are found north of about 20\u00b0S in the vicinity of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone.

When composites of daily rainfall anomalies are constructed by introducing eight phases in the time evolution, wet conditions are observed in MJO phases 1\u20132 and 7\u20138. During these phases, atmospheric circulation anomalies favor moisture advection from the western Indian Ocean to southern Iran. In contrast, dry conditions during MJO phases 3 to 6 are associated with advection of drier air from the north.\n",

        "description": "\n\nCorrelation analyses reveal that the perturbation potential energy (PPE) in the extratropics and tropics in boreal winters undergoes out-of-phase oscillations (PPE1 extratropics\u2013tropics oscillation, PETO). PETO is closely related to both El\u2009Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation  (ENSO) and kinetic energy, furthermore, PETO tends to dominate over the extratropics while ENSO is more important over the tropics. In the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere, positive PETO phases tend to strengthen (weaken) Hadley circulation and to weaken (strengthen) an expanded Ferrel circulation, resulting in equatorward shift of the subtropical jet streams. In addition, precipitation is enhanced in regions of ascending vertical motion, and warmer temperatures are observed in the tropics except over the western Pacific.\n",

Four types of SWV were classified according to dynamical and thermodynamical standards, and their main features were compared. This study presents the first analysis of the universal evolution mechanisms and energy conversion characteristics of long-lived SWVs by using the vorticity and kinetic energy budgets, as well as a new composite method under a normalized polar coordinate. Also, this study is the first work to reveal the three-dimensional shape of SWVs.\n",

Much of the water injected in the form of ice particles sublimated in the lower stratosphere. Net hydration was found with a 16% increase in water vapour. While moistening appeared to be robust with respect to the grid spacing used, grid spacing on the order of 100\u2009m may be necessary for a reliable estimate of hydration.\n",

Bromine increases dimethylsulphide (DMS) oxidation but lowers SO2 yield, leading to less sulphate aerosol. The effect is largest (3\u20137% decrease in total CCN and 15\u201330% decrease in CCN from DMS) over the summertime southern ocean, a region of strong bromine release from sea-salt. DMS and bromine emissions have a coupled feedback effect on CCN. Increased DMS enhances the release of sea-salt bromine through increased aerosol acidity. This enhanced bromine suppresses the CCN response to increased DMS by up to 30%.\n",

Their sensitivity is assessed through changing horizontal resolution, surface flux constraints, and constraining background atmospheric conditions. We assess two models at typical climate and weather forecast resolutions. Comparison with observations indicates that increasing resolution generally improves the pattern of tropical convection. When the models are constrained with realistic surface fluxes and atmospheric structure, the location of convection improves dramatically and is very similar irrespective of resolution and parameterizations used in the models.\n",

This paper further demonstrates how a positive (negative) boreal spring SAM is usually followed by a warmer (cooler) summer over northeast China (NEC), suggesting impacts of the SAM even extend to the northern mid-latitudes. A positive spring SAM usually leads to anomalous anticyclonic  sinking motion over NEC during summer through the NIO SST, which results in cloud reduction and changes in radiation, and thus surface warming.\n",

Regression analysis, which takes into account variations across the whole solar cycle rather than just the minimum /maximum solar years, fails to detect any direct solar influence on the ISM during June\u2013August. Regression suggests that the spatial pattern of ENSO, as imprinted in the sea level pressure in the Indian Ocean region, covering parts of Australia, has changed during the second half of last century. Thus ENSO impacts via variations in the local Hadley circulation may have played a role in modulating the ISM during that period. Finally, we discuss a possible indirect connection between the solar cycle and monsoon rainfall, which are different since the 1950s.\n",

Besides, El Ni\u00f1o-induced TIO basin-wide warming supports positive rainfall anomalies over the ISM region by maintaining local convection.

Moisture sources and transport of this event and quantification of the contribution from moisture sources were studied using the Lagrangian method.

Moreover, the total moisture from the source regions accounts for more than 80% of the precipitation; moisture originating from the India Peninsula\u2013Bay of Bengal\u2013Indo-China Peninsula region had the highest contribution.\n",
