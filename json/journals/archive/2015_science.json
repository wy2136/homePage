This motivated a young Ghanaian woman to study biotechnology, and a Ghanaian man, employed at a U.S. pharmaceutical company, to return to Ghana. In the past decade, enterprising young Nigerians with few resources went to China and found ways to bring cheap computers and other equipment home, allowing Nigerian students to access the Internet and learn. Profit-driven entrepreneurs like these, big and small, are promoting learning in low-income countries in different fields, including science and engineering. How can this process be furthered and accelerated in such countries?\nAuthor: Iqbal Quadir",

To anyone who remembers the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the reports from South Korea last week about another viral disease seemed grimly familiar. But virologists downplay parallels between SARS and the new outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The South Korean MERS outbreak is the biggest ever outside of Saudi Arabia. Yet the virus doesn't spread as easily as the SARS virus, and it shows no signs of mutating to become more dangerous. Christian Drosten, a virologist at the University of Bonn in Germany, says there is little doubt that South Korea will bring the virus under control. The episode may even have a silver lining: It could aid understanding of MERS, which was discovered only in 2012. In contrast to Saudi Arabia's reticence to let foreign scientists in or share data and samples, South Korea has so far provided regular updates and shared the virus with some outside experts.\nAuthor: Kai Kupferschmidt",

But most proteins and other organic matter completely decay within hundreds to thousands of years after the animal has died. Ten years ago, researchers in the United States reported that they had found surviving bits of proteins in 68-million-year-old dinosaur bones. But independent researchers have yet to confirm the result. Now, researchers in the United Kingdom report that they, too, have spotted surviving organic matter in eight dinosaur fossils that have been sitting in London's Natural History Museum for a century. If true, it holds out hope that organic matter in dinosaur fossils may be much more common than once thought. But the researchers have yet to prove that the proteins they have found indeed belong to the original dinosaur and not contaminants.\nAuthor: Robert F. Service",

        "description": "In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army unintentionally triggered some seismic activity by injecting waste fluids into the basement rock beneath the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver, Colorado (1). It is now recognized that an increase in the pressure applied by the fluids that fill fractures and faults at depth balances progressively the normal stress exerted through the rock on these fractures but leaves the shear stress supported by these surfaces unchanged. According to friction laws, when the fluid pressure gets too high and the effective normal stress gets too low, shear motion starts. This motion is generally considered to be mostly seismogenic, that is, to be the source of earthquakes that may reach in some localities magnitudes larger than 5, or even 6, as was observed upon filling the Koyna Dam in India in the early 1960s. Today, the phenomenon of fluid-induced seismicity has become a societal concern wherever injection of large quantity of fluids at depth is involved. On page 1224 of this issue, however, Guglielmi et al. (2) report that water injected in a natural fault at a depth of 282 m generates nonseismic motion. That is, the ground displacements take place at slow velocities (\u22484 \u00b5m/s), with only very small microseismic activity.\nAuthor: Francois H. Cornet",

Most of the genetic changes are harmless, but occasionally they can disturb normal cell functioning and lead to cancer or congenital diseases. Much of the novel genetic variation that arises in human genomes affects only one or a few nucleotides. However, catastrophic changes of genome structure, termed chromothripsis, can produce a dramatic reorganization of DNA on one or even several chromosomes. A recent study by Zhang et al.

However, under certain circumstances, such as coinfections, these responses may contribute to disease progression. For instance, an initial infection may induce an immune response that renders the host susceptible to a subsequent infection by a different pathogen. For years, it has been understood that Neisseria gonorrhoeae and HIV coinfection increase viral shedding and transmission (1). However, the molecular mechanisms that control this phenomenon have been unclear. Neisseria spp. release a factor that can activate the transcription factor nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in host cells and drive HIV gene expression (2). On page 1251 of this issue, Gaudet et al. (3) reveal the identity of this bacterial-derived factor, as well as the signaling axis through which it drives innate immune gene expression. This detection pathway may constitute a previously unknown innate immune signaling response with broader implications in microbial defense, as well as the pathogenesis of HIV.\nAuthors: Sky W.

They are not stored within cells, but are generated when their precursor, arachidonic acid, is mobilized from cellular membranes by rather nonspecific activation of phospholipases. Most cells generate one or two dominant PGs, each with a remarkable diversity of effects. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a vasodilator that acts with other PGs and metabolic products of arachidonic acid to promote pain and inflammation. The development and clinical use of drugs that suppress the production of these PGs has been ongoing for decades, but PGE2 also has been long recognized to have a role in tissue maintenance and regeneration. Its stable analog, dimethyl PGE2, is currently being evaluated for use as an adjunct to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. On page 1223 of this issue, Zhang et al. (1) report that elevating the capacity of tissues to form PGE2 by inhibiting 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), its major inactivating enzyme, augments the capacity for tissue regeneration in mouse models. So, is it time to bring PGE2, which we are so used to suppressing, in from the cold?\nAuthor: Garret A. FitzGerald",

These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems.

Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.\nAuthors: Roland Kays, Margaret C.

Prostaglandin PGE2, a lipid signaling molecule that supports expansion of several types of tissue stem cells, is a candidate therapeutic target for promoting tissue regeneration in vivo. Here, we show that inhibition of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a prostaglandin-degrading enzyme, potentiates tissue regeneration in multiple organs in mice. In a chemical screen, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of 15-PGDH (SW033291) that increases prostaglandin PGE2 levels in bone marrow and other tissues. SW033291 accelerates hematopoietic recovery in mice receiving a bone marrow transplant. The same compound also promotes tissue regeneration in mouse models of colon and liver injury. Tissues from 15-PGDH knockout mice demonstrate similar increased regenerative capacity. Thus, 15-PGDH inhibition may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration in diverse clinical contexts.\nAuthors: Yongyou Zhang, Amar Desai, Sung Yeun Yang, Ki Beom Bae, Monika I.

The mechanisms involved are poorly understood, and our ability to assess the seismic hazard associated with geothermal energy or unconventional hydrocarbon production remains limited. We directly measure fault slip and seismicity induced by fluid injection into a natural fault. We observe highly dilatant and slow [~4 micrometers per second (\u03bcm/s)] aseismic slip associated with a 20-fold increase of permeability, which transitions to faster slip (~10 \u03bcm/s) associated with reduced dilatancy and micro-earthquakes. Most aseismic slip occurs within the fluid-pressurized zone and obeys a rate-strengthening friction law \u03bc=0.67+0.045ln(vv0) with v0 = 0.1 \u03bcm/s. Fluid injection primarily triggers aseismic slip in this experiment, with micro-earthquakes being an indirect effect mediated by aseismic creep.\nAuthors: Yves Guglielmi, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cappa, Jean-Philippe Avouac, Pierre Henry, Derek Elsworth",

Traditional synthetic methods control size by terminating the growth, an approach that limits the reaction yield and causes batch-to-batch variability. Herein we report a library of thioureas whose substitution pattern tunes their conversion reactivity over more than five orders of magnitude and demonstrate that faster thiourea conversion kinetics increases the extent of crystal nucleation. Tunable kinetics thereby allows the nanocrystal concentration to be adjusted and a desired crystal size to be prepared at full conversion. Controlled precursor reactivity and quantitative conversion improve the batch-to-batch consistency of the final nanocrystal size at industrially relevant reaction scales.\nAuthors: Mark P.

The Mo\u2010Pt3Ni/C showed the best ORR performance, with a specific activity of 10.3 mA/cm2 and mass activity of 6.98 A/mgPt, which are 81- and 73\u2010fold enhancements compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.127 mA/cm2 and 0.096 A/mgPt).

Because the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, deposition of dense and uniform films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI3 films, involving FAPbI3 crystallization by the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide. This process produces FAPbI3 films with (111)-preferred crystallographic orientation, large-grained dense microstructures, and flat surfaces without residual PbI2. Using films prepared by this technique, we fabricated FAPbI3-based PSCs with maximum power conversion efficiency greater than 20%.\nAuthors: Woon Seok Yang, Jun Hong Noh, Nam Joong Jeon, Young Chan Kim, Seungchan Ryu, Jangwon Seo, Sang Il Seok",

        "description": "The percentage of oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere varied between 10% and 35% throughout the Phanerozoic. These changes have been linked to the evolution, radiation, and size of animals but have not been considered to affect climate. We conducted simulations showing that modulation of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), as a result of its contribution to atmospheric mass and density, influences the optical depth of the atmosphere. Under low pO2 and a reduced-density atmosphere, shortwave scattering by air molecules and clouds is less frequent, leading to a substantial increase in surface shortwave forcing. Through feedbacks involving latent heat fluxes to the atmosphere and marine stratus clouds, surface shortwave forcing drives increases in atmospheric water vapor and global precipitation, enhances greenhouse forcing, and raises global surface temperature. Our results implicate pO2 as an important factor in climate forcing throughout geologic time.\nAuthors: Christopher J. Poulsen, Clay Tabor, Joseph D. White",

        "description": "During rest, brain activity is synchronized between different regions widely distributed throughout the brain, forming functional networks. However, the molecular mechanisms supporting functional connectivity remain undefined. We show that functional brain networks defined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can be recapitulated by using measures of correlated gene expression in a post mortem brain tissue data set. The set of 136 genes we identify is significantly enriched for ion channels. Polymorphisms in this set of genes significantly affect resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy adolescents. Expression levels of these genes are also significantly associated with axonal connectivity in the mouse. The results provide convergent, multimodal evidence that resting-state functional networks correlate with the orchestrated activity of dozens of genes linked to ion channel activity and synaptic function.\nAuthors: Jonas Richiardi, Andre Altmann, Anna-Clare Milazzo, Catie Chang, M.

        "description": "Animals must operate under an enormous range of light intensities. Nocturnal and twilight flying insects are hypothesized to compensate for dim conditions by integrating light over longer times. This slowing of visual processing would increase light sensitivity but should also reduce movement response times. Using freely hovering moths tracking robotic moving flowers, we showed that the moth\u2019s visual processing does slow in dim light. These longer response times are consistent with models of how visual neurons enhance sensitivity at low light intensities, but they could pose a challenge for moths feeding from swaying flowers. Dusk-foraging moths avoid this sensorimotor tradeoff; their nervous systems slow down but not so much as to interfere with their ability to track the movements of real wind-blown flowers.\nAuthors: Simon Sponberg, Jonathan P.

        "description": "It has been argued that globalization in human-mediated dispersal of species breaks down biogeographic boundaries, yet empirical tests are still missing. We used data on native and alien ranges of terrestrial gastropods to analyze dissimilarities in species composition among 56 globally distributed regions. We found that native ranges confirm the traditional biogeographic realms, reflecting natural dispersal limitations. However, the distributions of gastropods after human transport are primarily explained by the prevailing climate and, to a smaller extent, by distance and trade relationships. Our findings show that human-mediated dispersal is causing a breakdown of biogeographic barriers, and that climate and to some extent socioeconomic relationships will define biogeography in an era of global change.\nAuthors: C\u00e9sar Capinha, Franz Essl, Hanno Seebens, Dietmar Moser, Henrique Miguel Pereira",

        "description": "Host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) initiates an innate immune response that is critical for pathogen elimination and engagement of adaptive immunity. Here we show that mammalian cells can detect and respond to the bacterial-derived monosaccharide heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP). A metabolic intermediate in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, HBP is highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, yet absent from eukaryotic cells. Detection of HBP within the host cytosol activated the nuclear facto \u03baB pathway in vitro and induced innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo. Moreover, we used a genome-wide RNA interference screen to uncover an innate immune signaling axis, mediated by phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) that is triggered by HBP. Thus, HBP is a PAMP that activates TIFA-dependent immunity to Gram-negative bacteria.\nAuthors: Ryan G. Gaudet, Anna Sintsova, Carolyn M. Buckwalter, Nelly Leung, Alan Cochrane, Jianjun Li, Andrew D.

        "description": "Blood gas and tissue pH regulation depend on the ability of the brain to sense CO2 and/or H+ and alter breathing appropriately, a homeostatic process called central respiratory chemosensitivity. We show that selective expression of the proton-activated receptor GPR4 in chemosensory neurons of the mouse retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is required for CO2-stimulated breathing. Genetic deletion of GPR4 disrupted acidosis-dependent activation of RTN neurons, increased apnea frequency, and blunted ventilatory responses to CO2. Reintroduction of GPR4 into RTN neurons restored CO2-dependent RTN neuronal activation and rescued the ventilatory phenotype. Additional elimination of TASK-2 (K2P5), a pH-sensitive K+ channel expressed in RTN neurons, essentially abolished the ventilatory response to CO2. The data identify GPR4 and TASK-2 as distinct, parallel, and essential central mediators of respiratory chemosensitivity.\nAuthors: Natasha N.

        "description": "The spindle checkpoint of the cell division cycle senses kinetochores that are not attached to microtubules and prevents precocious onset of anaphase, which can lead to aneuploidy. The nuclear division cycle 80 complex (Ndc80C) is a major microtubule receptor at the kinetochore. Ndc80C also mediates the kinetochore recruitment of checkpoint proteins. We found that the checkpoint protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) directly bound to Ndc80C through two independent interactions. Both interactions involved the microtubule-binding surfaces of Ndc80C and were directly inhibited in the presence of microtubules. Elimination of one such interaction in human cells caused checkpoint defects expected from a failure to detect unattached kinetochores. Competition between Mps1 and microtubules for Ndc80C binding thus constitutes a direct mechanism for the detection of unattached kinetochores.\nAuthors: Zhejian Ji, Haishan Gao, Hongtao Yu",

        "description": "Cell division progresses to anaphase only after all chromosomes are connected to spindle microtubules through kinetochores and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is satisfied. We show that the amino-terminal localization module of the SAC protein kinase MPS1 (monopolar spindle 1) directly interacts with the HEC1 (highly expressed in cancer 1) calponin homology domain in the NDC80 (nuclear division cycle 80) kinetochore complex in vitro, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Microtubule polymers disrupted this interaction. In cells, MPS1 binding to kinetochores or to ectopic NDC80 complexes was prevented by end-on microtubule attachment, independent of known kinetochore protein-removal mechanisms. Competition for kinetochore binding between SAC proteins and microtubules provides a direct and perhaps evolutionarily conserved way to detect a properly organized spindle ready for cell division.\nAuthors: Yoshitaka Hiruma, Carlos Sacristan, Spyridon T.

Here, we show that an M-locus gene, Nix, functions as an M factor in A. aegypti. Nix exhibits persistent M linkage and early embryonic expression, two characteristics required of an M factor. Nix knockout with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2013Cas9 resulted in largely feminized genetic males and the production of female isoforms of two key regulators of sexual differentiation: doublesex and fruitless. Ectopic expression of Nix resulted in genetic females with nearly complete male genitalia. Thus, Nix is both required and sufficient to initiate male development. This study provides a foundation for mosquito control strategies that convert female mosquitoes into harmless males.\nAuthors: Andrew Brantley Hall, Sanjay Basu, Xiaofang Jiang, Yumin Qi, Vladimir A.
