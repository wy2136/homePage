        "description": "\n\nWe present coral and sclerosponge based reconstructions of the 14C content in North Atlantic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during the last ~100 years from the subtropical cells (STCs). These waters are sensitive to the dynamics of the shallow overturning meridional circulation that transports heat and water masses from the subtropics to the tropics. We use these records to investigate the circulation patterns of the off-equatorial upwelling regions of the STCs, which are not well understood. Coral and sclerosponge skeletons provide long time-series of ocean DIC 14C content, a tracer of oceanic circulation, effectively extending the observational record back in time. Sclerosponge data from the Bahamas were used to extend the existing subtropical 14C time series to the 21st century. Coral 14C data from the Cape Verde Islands (1890\u20132002) captured the 14C signature of water brought to the surface in the off-equatorial regions of the STC present near the West African coast. We observe a unique post-bomb trend at Cape Verde that is similar to the upwelling regions in the Pacific, and we interpret this trend as the result of the slow penetration of bomb 14C into the interior ocean as part of the STC circulation. Using a multi-box mixing model we constrain the time history of bomb 14C in the eastern tropical Atlantic, and we estimate a 20-year timescale for ventilation of the thermocline in this area of the Ocean. The similarity between the Atlantic and Pacific 14C-based records of upwelling suggests that both are caused by bomb 14C penetration rather than more complex explanations that invoke changes in thermocline depth (e.g., related to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation variability) or changes in the strength of the subtropical cells. Our results offer constraints for models of tropical ocean circulation and anthropogenic CO2 uptake that attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the shallow wind driven circulation in the Atlantic.",

Throughout the studied sequence, dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are dominated by upwelling-related taxa, signifying the continued presence of coastal upwelling on the margin during the late Quaternary. The cyst record suggests that marine primary productivity was enhanced during the Holocene and B\u00f8lling, and to a lesser extent, during the late glacial and most Dansgaard-Oeschger events, while an apparent reduction in primary productivity can be seen during the Younger Dryas. The best-analogue technique, based on a modern dinoflagellate cyst assemblage database from the Northeast Pacific, was used for quantitative reconstruction of past sea-surface conditions. It points to dynamic changes in annual marine primary productivity (~235-331 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121) and sea-surface temperature (~10.1-12.6\u00b0C in winter; ~13.1-14.3\u00b0C in summer), while sea-surface salinity appears to be confined to a narrower range (~32.9-33.4 psu in summer).

The low delta15N during the event is generally attributed to an increase in N2-fixation and incomplete uptake of NH4+ for phytoplankton growth. A compilation of all reliable data for the proto North-Atlantic during OAE 2 demonstrates that the most pronounced negative shift in \u03b415N from pre-OAE 2 to OAE 2 occurs in the open ocean, but with \u03b415N never lower than \u22123 . Using a box model of N cycling for the proto-North Atlantic during OAE 2, we show that N2-fixation is a major contributor to the \u03b415N signal, especially in the open ocean. Incomplete uptake of NH4+ for phytoplankton growth is important in regions dominated by downwelling, with lateral transport of NH4+ acting as a major source. In the southern proto-North Atlantic, where bottom waters were euxinic, the light \u03b415N signature is largely explained by upwelling of NH4+. Our study provides an overview of regional differences in \u03b415N in the proto-North Atlantic and highlights the role of lateral exchange of water and nutrients, in addition to local biogeochemical processes, in determining \u03b415N values of OAE 2 sediments.",

At sea surface, southern-sourced Cold Coastal Water and tropical Equatorial Surface Water/Tropical Surface Water are intimately related. In particular since ~10 ka, independent sea surface temperature proxies capturing different seasons emphasize the growing seasonal contrast in the Gulf of Guayaquil, which is in contrast to ocean areas further offshore. Cold Coastal Water became rapidly present in the Gulf of Guayaquil during the austral winter season in line with the strengthening of the Southeast Trades, while coastal upwelling off Peru gradually intensified and expanded northward in response to a seasonally changing atmospheric circulation pattern affecting the core locations intensively since 4 ka BP. Equatorial Surface Water, instead, was displaced and Tropical Surface Water moved northward together with the Equatorial Front. At subsurface, the presence of Equatorial Under Current-sourced Equatorial Subsurface Water was continuously growing, prominently since ~10-8 ka BP. During Heinrich Stadial 1 and large parts of the B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d, and similarly during short Holocene time intervals at ~5.1-4 ka BP and ~1.5-0.5 ka BP, the admixture of Equatorial Subsurface Water was reduced in response to both short-term weakening of Equatorial Under Current strength from the northwest and emplacement by tropical Equatorial Surface Water considerably warming the uppermost ocean layers.",

These data indicate tight coupling between the degree of nitrate consumption and Antarctic climate across the last two glacial cycles, with \u03b415Ndb (and thus the degree of nitrate consumption) increasing at each major Antarctic cooling event. Coupled with evidence from opal- and barium-based proxies for reduced export production during ice ages, the \u03b415Ndb increases point to ice age reductions in the supply of deep ocean-sourced nitrate to the AZ surface. The two diatom assemblages and species abundance data indicate that the \u03b415Ndb changes are not the result of changing species composition. The pennate and centric assemblage \u03b415Ndb records indicate similar changes, but with a significant decline in their difference during peak ice ages.

        "description": "\n\nPublished reconstructions of radiocarbon in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean indicate that there is a mid-depth maximum in radiocarbon age during the last glacial maximum (LGM). This is in contrast to the modern ocean where intense mixing between water masses results in a relatively homogenous radiocarbon profile. Ferrari et al. [2014] suggested that the extended Antarctic sea ice cover during the LGM necessitated a shallower boundary between the upper and lower branches of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). This shoaled boundary lay above major topographic features associated with strong diapycnal mixing, isolating dense southern-sourced water in the lower branch of the overturning circulation. This isolation would have allowed radiocarbon to decay, and thus provides a possible explanation for the mid-depth radiocarbon age bulge. We test this hypothesis using an idealized, 2D, residual-mean dynamical model of the global overturning circulation. Concentration distributions of a decaying tracer that is advected by the simulated overturning are compared to published radiocarbon data. We find that a 600 km (~5\u00b0 of latitude) increase in sea ice extent shoals the boundary between the upper and lower branches of the overturning circulation at 45\u00b0S by 600 m, and shoals the depth of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) convection at 50\u00b0N by 2500 m. This change in circulation configuration alone decreases the radiocarbon content in the mid-depth South Atlantic at 45\u00b0S by 40\u2030even without an increase in surface radiocarbon age in the source region of deep waters during the LGM.\n",

Paleo-sea surface temperatures (SST) were estimated from planktic foraminiferal census counts from cores straddling the modern S-STF in the Solander Trough, south of New Zealand. The estimated SST were compared for 6 time slices; glacial period (25-21 ka), last glacial maximum (LGM; 21-18 ka), early deglaciation (18-16 ka), late deglacial/early Holocene period (14-8 ka), mid-Holocene period (8-4 ka) and late Holocene period (4-0 ka). The position of the S-STF was determined by two methods: 1) the location of the 10\u00b0C isotherm and 2) the location of the highest SST gradients. These new results suggest that the S-STF was not continuous between east and west of New Zealand during the glacial period. Steep SST gradients indicate that a strong S-STF rapidly shifted south during the LGM and early deglaciation. During the late deglacial and Holocene periods the position of the S-STF differs between the two methods with reduced SST gradients suggesting a more diffuse S-STF in the Solander Trough at this time. The glacial SST data suggest that the S-STF shifted north to the west of New Zealand, while to the east there was a stronger SST gradient across the front. This was possibly the result of an increased wind stress curl, which could have been caused by stronger, or more northerly Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SHWW), or a merging of the SHWW split jet in this region.\n",

In order to better understand the mechanism of formation of E. rex LDMs from the perspective of dissolved silicon (DSi) utilization, we determined the silicon isotopic composition of single E. rex diatom frustules (\u03b430SiE. rex) from two sediment cores in the Parece Vela Basin of the EPS. In the study cores, \u03b430SiE. rex varies from \u22121.23\u2030 to \u22120.83\u2030 (average \u22121.04\u2030), a range that is atypical of marine diatom \u03b430Si and that corresponds to the lower limit of reported diatom \u03b430Si values of any age. A binary mixing model (upwelled silicon vs. eolian silicon) accounting for silicon isotopic fractionation during DSi uptake by diatoms was constructed. The binary mixing model demonstrates that E. rex dominantly utilized DSi from eolian sources (i.e., Asian dust) with only minor contributions from upwelled seawater sources (i.e., advected from Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), or North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW)). E. rex utilized only ~24% of available DSi, indicating that surface waters of the EPS were eutrophic with respect to silicon during the LGM. Our results suggest that giant diatoms did not always use a buoyancy strategy to obtain nutrients from the deep nutrient pool, thus revising previously proposed models for the formation of E. rex LDMs.",

The relationship between orbital variations in the IRD record and climate drivers was evaluated to capture changes in the dynamics of a marine-based ice sheet in response to early Pliocene warming. Three IRD MAR excursions were observed and confirmed via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) microtextural analysis of sand grains. Time series analysis of the IRD MAR reveals obliquity paced expansions of the ice sheet to the outer shelf prior to ~4.6 Ma. A decline in the obliquity and a transition into a dominant precession response of IRD MAR occurs at ~4.6 Ma along with a decline in the amplitude of IRD MAR maxima to low background levels between ~4.0 and ~3.5 Ma. We speculate that as sea surface temperatures (SSTs) began to peak above 3\u00b0C during the early Pliocene climatic optimum, the ice shelves thinned, leading to a greater susceptibility to precession forced summer insolation and the onset of persistent retreat of a marine-based portion of the EAIS.\n",

The site is in the flow path of Atlantic inflow waters entering the Mediterranean and captured North Atlantic signals through the surface inflow and the atmosphere. The records reveal similar climatic oscillations during the last two glacial-to-interglacial transitions, albeit with a different temporal pacing. Glacial termination 1 (T1) was marked by Heinrich event 1 (H1), post-H1 Bolling/Allerod (B/A) warming and Younger Dryas (YD) cooling. During T2 the H11 \uf06418O anomaly was twice as high and lasted 30% longer than during H1. The post-H11 warming marked the start of MIS5e while the subsequent YD-style cooling occurred during early MIS5e. The post-H11 temperature increase at ODP976 matched the sudden Asian Monsoon Termination II at 129 ka BP. Extending the 230Th-dated speleothem timescale to ODP976 suggests glacial conditions in the Northeast Atlantic region were terminated abruptly and interglacial warmth was reached in less than a millennium. The early-MIS5e cooling and freshening at ODP976 coincided with similar changes at North Atlantic sites suggesting this was a basin-wide event. By analogy with T1 we argue that this was a YD-type event that was shifted into the early stages of the last interglacial period. This scenario is consistent with evidence from northern North Atlantic and Nordic Sea sites that the continuing disintegration of the large Saalian Stage (MIS6) ice sheet in Eurasia delayed the advection of warm North Atlantic waters and full-strength convective overturn until later stages of MIS5e.\n",

Results show that total annual mean Pliocene Mediterranean runoff is about 40% larger than during the pre-industrial period due to more increased extra-tropical specific humidity. As a consequence of a weakened and extended Hadley cell, the Pliocene northwest Africa hydrological network produces a discharge 30 timeslarger than today. Our results support the conclusion that during the Pliocene, the Mediterranean water deficit was reduced relative to today due to a larger river discharge. By means of a stand-alone atmospheric general circulation model, we simulate the separate impact of extra-tropical and equatorial SST cooling on the Mediterranean runoff. While cooling of equatorial SST does not imply significant changes to the Pliocene Mediterranean hydrological budget, the extra-tropical SST cooling increases the water deficit due to a decrease in precipitation and runoff. Consequently river discharge from this area reduces to pre-industrial levels. The main teleconnections acting upon the Mediterranean area today, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation during winter and the \u201cmonsoon-desert\u201d mechanism during summer already have a large influence on the climate of our Pliocene simulations. Finally, our results also suggest that in a climate state significantly warmer than today, changes of the Hadley circulation could potentially lead to increased water resources in northwest Africa.\n",

These perturbations have been explained by several hypotheses: global collapse of primary productivity (Strangelove Ocean); greatly reduced export but not primary productivity (Living Ocean); little or no reduction in export productivity (Resilient Ocean); and geographic heterogeneity in the change of export productivity (Heterogeneous Ocean). We tested primary vs. export productivity changes in the paleoshelf of New Jersey, where \u03b413C values and organic carbon accumulation rates can distinguish among different ocean responses. On the shelf, the K/Pg boundary is associated with a ~2.5\u2030 \u03b413C decrease in bulk carbonate, a ~0.8\u2030 \u03b413C decrease in organic carbon, a collapse of the surface to bottom \u03b413C gradient, and a drop in organic carbon percentage.

In this study, we focus on stable isotope\u2013based methods (\u03b418O and \u03b42H) to derive paleosalinity. We use the water isotopes-enabled fully coupled atmosphere/ocean/vegetation/land surface three-dimensional model of intermediate complexity iLOVECLIM to simulate the climate and water isotopes during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and Heinrich event 1. We investigate how the isotopes in water can be used as reliable proxies to quantitatively reconstruct past changes in seawater salinity. Our results demonstrate that a quantitative salinity reconstruction during glacial conditions based on present-day regional \u03b418O-salinity relationships can lead to considerable errors (up to 25 g/kg in certain regions). However, we show that these eventual uncertainties on paleosalinity reconstruction can be reduced by allowing for model-derived regional \u03b418O-salinity relationships to vary through time. Our results indicate a rather stable dependence between \u03b42H and \u03b418O in surface seawater during the LGM. This suggest that quantitative reconstruction of salinity based on the \u03b42H measurement of alkenones (\u03b42Ha) might be possible if the slope and the intercept of the regression between the fractionation factor \u03b42Ha-\u03b42Hsw and salinity can be sufficiently tightly constrained in open ocean conditions.

Multiple processes are known to control the deposition of marine black shales, including changes in primary productivity, organic matter preservation and dilution. OAEs offer an opportunity to evaluate the relative roles of these forcing factors. The youngest of these events \u2013 the Coniacian to Santonian OAE 3 \u2013 resulted in a prolonged organic carbon burial event in shallow and restricted marine environments including the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). New high-resolution isotope, organic and trace metal records from the latest Turonian to early Santonian Niobrara Formation are used to characterize the amount and composition of organic matter preserved, as well as the geochemical conditions under which it accumulated. Redox sensitive metals (Mo, Mn, Re) indicate a gradual drawdown of oxygen leading into the abrupt onset of organic carbon rich (up to 8%) deposition. High Hydrogen Indices (HI) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratios (C:N) demonstrate that the elemental composition of preserved marine organic matter is distinct under different redox conditions. Local changes in \u03b413C indicate that redox controlled early diagenesis can also significantly alter \u03b413Corg records. These results demonstrate that the development of anoxia is of primary importance in triggering the prolonged carbon burial in the Niobrara Formation. Sea level reconstructions, \u03b418O results, and Mo/TOC ratios suggest that stratification and enhanced bottom water restriction caused the drawdown of bottom water oxygen.

In some parts of the Oligocene, the discrepancy with previous studies exceeds 450\u2009kyr. Based on this new age model, we infer a progressive increase in sedimentation rate and paleoproductivity between circa 23.9\u2009Ma and circa 22.9\u2009Ma, with the highest rate coinciding with the Mi-1 glacial event at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. This productivity increase would have resulted in higher rates of carbon burial and in turn a drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Immediately afterward, an abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate and paleoproductivity suggests that the Mi-1 deglaciation was associated with decreased carbon input into the ocean. Elevated sedimentation rates are also documented at ~24.5\u2009Ma, coincident with the Oi2D glacioeustatic event. The presence of volcanic material within the sediments during these glacial events is interpreted to have resulted from redeposition of sediment scoured from nearby sites on the Rio Grande Rise due to transient variations in bottom water flow patterns.",

We present organic carbon (%OC) and diffuse spectral reflectivity records as indicative of upwelling and productivity changes off NW Mexico over the middle to late Pleistocene. The new productivity records document the persistence of abrupt millennial-scale changes over the last two glacial cycles. Detailed spectral and wavelet time series analyses show the predominance of longer climatic cycles (2\u20136\u2009ka) during the last and the penultimate glacial periods. The persistence of millennial variability during the penultimate glacial, in absence of large ice rafted debris events in the North Atlantic, suggests that freshwater input through ice sheet dynamics is not essential for millennial-scale climate variability. Given the worldwide emerging picture of remarkable similar millennial-scale records over long time periods, we suggest that the pacing of this climate variability may represent a natural resonance in the climate system, amplified by a tightly coupled oceanic and atmospheric teleconnection processes. We present a schematic scenario of millennial-scale climate change depicting the role of the tropical Pacific in this global teleconnection system by linking productivity and upwelling changes in the ETNP with shifts in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the strength of the subtropical North Pacific High.",

Based on high-resolution multiproxy records, our results suggest that the competing processes of sea level and monsoonally driven precipitation determined terrigenous input to the northern ECS. Dominance of terrigenous material, along with relatively light Globigerinoides ruber \u03b418O, indicates that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) lowstand of sea level has occurred during the period 21.5\u201319.6\u2009ka, not suggesting an early slow rise but supporting the conventional LGM age of 21\u2009ka. This LGM lowstand was terminated by the rapid sea level rise of 19\u2009ka meltwater pulse (MWP), which is well expressed by the nearly synchronous decreases in both terrigenous detritus and mean grain size from 19.6 to 18.9\u2009ka. MWP-1A is clearly marked in our records by a sharp reduction in terrigenous input and pronounced maxima of G. ruber \u03b418O at 15.3\u201314.8\u2009ka, given the considerable age uncertainties of deglacial marine radiocarbon samples. A slightly increasing input of terrigenous matter is noted after 13.4\u2009ka, potentially pointing to a sea level fall following the Inter-Aller\u00f8d Cooling Period, which was seldom reported previously. Although MWP-1B did not leave robust signatures in terrigenous input, it is explicitly captured by the heavy \u03b418O of G. ruber and decline in mean grain size at 11.5\u201310.9\u2009ka. MWP-1c probably occurred in a broad millennial interval with multiple peaks, which are robustly marked by the abrupt variations in terrigenous input and marine organic matter at 9.7\u20139.3 and 9.1\u2009ka, respectively. During the late Holocene, the effect of continuously weakening monsoon precipitation overwhelmed that of stable sea level resulting in a uniform increase in the proportion of marine-derived organic matter after 5.5\u2009ka.",

        "description": "\n\nChanges in ocean circulation structure, together with biological cycling, have been proposed for trapping carbon in the deep ocean during glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, but uncertainty remains in the nature and timing of deep ocean circulation changes through glacial cycles. In this study, we use neodymium (Nd) and carbon isotopes from a deep Indian Ocean sediment core to reconstruct water mass mixing and carbon cycling in Circumpolar Deep Water over the past 250 thousand years, a period encompassing two full glacial cycles and including a range of orbital forcing. Building on recent studies, we use reductive sediment leaching supported by measurements on isolated phases (foraminifera and fish teeth) in order to obtain a robust seawater Nd isotope reconstruction. Neodymium isotopes record a changing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) component in the deep Indian Ocean that bears a striking resemblance to Northern Hemisphere climate records. In particular, we identify both an approximately in-phase link to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation in the precession band and a longer-term reduction of NADW contributions over the course of glacial cycles. The orbital timescale changes may record the influence of insolation forcing, for example via NADW temperature and/or Antarctic sea ice extent, on deep stratification and mixing in the Southern Ocean, leading to isolation of the global deep oceans from an NADW source during times of low Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. That evidence could support an active role for changing deep ocean circulation in carbon storage during glacial inceptions. However, mid-depth water mass mixing and deep ocean carbon storage were largely decoupled within glacial periods, and a return to an interglacial-like circulation state during marine isotope stage (MIS) 6.5 was accompanied by only minor changes in atmospheric CO2. Although a gradual reduction of NADW export through glacial periods may have produced slow climate feedbacks linked to the growth of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, carbon cycling in the glacial ocean was instead more strongly linked to Southern Ocean processes.",

Optically stimulated luminescence ages reveal episodes of rapid dust deposition at approximately 12.3\u2009ka, 16\u2009ka, 21\u201323\u2009ka, 25\u201328\u2009ka, and possibly also at 30\u201333\u2009ka. These episodes are broadly correlated with high-latitude and marine records cold climatic events, such as the Younger Dryas, Heinrich event 1, and the Last Glacial Maximum. This correlation implies that dust storms in the NETP represent episodic aridification and wind strengthening, which is ascribed to the southward shift of the polar front and the intensification of the Siberian high-pressure cell that was forced by millennial-scale cooling in high northern latitudes.",

Information provided by benthic foraminiferal assemblages together with paleoclimate proxies from the same core allow us to interpret changes in the style of primary production (episodic versus sustained) in relation to abrupt climate oscillations. Our results indicate that fluctuations in the abundance of the phytodetritus-related species, Epistominella exigua, are concomitant with millennial-scale high-latitude climate perturbations. Episodic phytoplankton blooms increased during a negative mode of the bipolar seesaw, irrespective of the magnitude of the perturbation (i.e., Heinrich stadial versus non-Heinrich stadial events). We provide a hypothesis linking the frequency and intensity of these events to atmospheric perturbations, interhemispheric climate variability, and millennial-scale changes in atmospheric CO2. A notable exception to the overall pattern is the generally high abundance of E. exigua across the globally synchronous onset of glacial marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 4, a period generally characterized by increased dustiness and low-quality organic carbon as inferred by the percentage of the nonphytodetritus species.

Comparing the SNP dust record to the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice core record shows significant differences in the amplitude of dust changes to the two regions during the last deglaciation, while the timing of abrupt changes is synchronous. If dust deposition in the SNP faithfully records its mobilization in East Asian source regions, then the difference in the relative amplitude must reflect climate-related changes in atmospheric dust transport to Greenland. Based on the synchronicity in the timing of dust changes in the SNP and Greenland, we tie abrupt deglacial transitions in the 230Th-normalized 4He flux record to corresponding transitions in the well-dated NGRIP dust flux record to provide a new chronostratigraphic technique for marine sediments from the SNP. Results from this technique are complemented by radiocarbon dating, which allows us to independently constrain radiocarbon paleoreservoir ages. We find paleoreservoir ages of 745\u2009\u00b1\u2009140\u2009years at 11,653\u2009year B.P., 680\u2009\u00b1\u2009228\u2009years at 14,630\u2009year B.P., and 790\u2009\u00b1\u2009498\u2009years at 23,290\u2009year B.P. Our reconstructed paleoreservoir ages are consistent with modern surface water reservoir ages in the western SNP.

While there is growing evidence that the overflow of dense water changed on orbital time scales during the Holocene, less is known about the variability on shorter time scales beyond the instrumental record. Here we reconstruct the relative changes in flow strength of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), the eastern branch of the overflows, on multidecadal-millennial time scales. The reconstruction is based on mean sortable silt (SS\u00af) from a sediment core on the Gardar Drift (60\u00b019\u2032N, 23\u00b058\u2032W, 2081\u2009m). Our SS\u00af record reveals that the main variance in ISOW vigor occurred on millennial time scales (1\u20132\u2009kyr) with particularly prominent fluctuations after 8\u2009kyr. Superimposed on the millennial variability, there were multidecadal-centennial flow speed fluctuations during the early Holocene (10\u20139\u2009kyr) and one prominent minimum at 0.9\u2009kyr. We find a broad agreement between reconstructed ISOW and regional North Atlantic climate, where a strong (weak) ISOW is generally associated with warm (cold) climate. We further identify the possible contribution of anomalous heat and freshwater forcing, respectively, related to reconstructed overflow variability. We infer that ocean poleward heat transport can explain the relationship between regional climate and ISOW during the middle to late Holocene, whereas freshwater input provides a possible explanation for the reduced overflow during early Holocene (8\u201310\u2009kyr).",

Due to the difficulties in studying the paleogeographic evolution of these corridors, physics-based knowledge of their behavior is essential to interpret observational evidence and to relate flow structures to gateway geometries. Here we present the first systematic model study of the water exchange through these gateways. We use the parallel version of the Princeton Ocean Model (sbPOM) and a set of idealized bathymetries based on a late Tortonian paleogeography. This analysis represents a major step forward in the understanding of the behavior of the double-gateway system constituted by the Late Miocene Betic and Rifian corridors. We demonstrate that the \u201csiphon\u201d scenario, involving inflow of cold upwelled Atlantic water through the Rifian corridor and outflow of Mediterranean water only via the Betic corridor, is unlikely from a physics perspective. It is shown that two exchange patterns are possible depending solely on the relative depth of the corridors. The implication of this is that geological evidence for the behavior of one corridor provides information about the dimensions of the other. We show that disappearance of outflow in one corridor does not necessarily imply its closure and we establish a guideline to determine how geological evidence can be interpreted as indicating one- or two-layer flow. Based on the model results, we propose new physics-based scenarios for the time interval defined for the siphon.",

This is inconsistent with the interpretation of lake and ocean sediment records from the eastern Pacific, which show a significant reduction compared to all other Holocene periods. In order to reconcile the seemingly conflicting proxy evidence from the eastern and central Pacific, we hypothesize that ENSO remained active during the mid-Holocene; however, there was a change in the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies, also known as ENSO flavors. Using National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model version 4 forced with mid-Holocene orbital conditions, we find that the frequency of occurrence of the strongest eastern Pacific (EP) events decreases in the mid-Holocene and their variance is reduced by \u223c30%, while the frequency of central Pacific (CP) events slightly increases and their variance does not change. We also find a shift in the seasonality of EP events, but not in that of CP events. Lastly, mid-Holocene EP events develop more slowly and decay faster. The differential response of ENSO flavors to mid-Holocene forcing is remotely forced by the West Pacific, where a weakening of the trade winds in early boreal spring in the mid-Holocene initiates an anomalous downwelling annual Kelvin wave, which reaches the eastern Pacific during the ENSO development season, weakens the upper ocean stratification, and results in reduced ENSO upwelling feedback. The simulated reduction in the EP flavor versus the CP flavor in the mid-Holocene is consistent with proxy evidence: The teleconnection patterns of the two flavors with temperature, precipitation, and salinity are distinct, and proxies from different regions of the Pacific might be recording variability associated with only one of the flavors, or some combination of their relative effects.",

        "description": "\nGlobal warming lowers the solubility of gases in the ocean and drives an enhanced hydrological cycle with increased nutrient loads delivered to the oceans, leading to increases in organic production, the degradation of which causes a further decrease in dissolved oxygen. In extreme cases in the geological past, this trajectory has led to catastrophic marine oxygen depletion during the so-called oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). How the water column oscillated between generally oxic conditions and local/global anoxia remains a challenging question, exacerbated by a lack of sensitive redox proxies, especially for the suboxic window. To address this problem, we use bulk carbonate I/Ca to reconstruct subtle redox changes in the upper ocean water column at seven sites recording the Cretaceous OAE 2. In general, I/Ca ratios were relatively low preceding and during the OAE interval, indicating deep suboxic or anoxic waters exchanging directly with near-surface waters. However, individual sites display a wide range of initial values and excursions in I/Ca through the OAE interval, reflecting the importance of local controls and suggesting a high spatial variability in redox state. Both I/Ca and an Earth System Model suggest that the northeast proto-Atlantic had notably higher oxygen levels in the upper water column than the rest of the North Atlantic, indicating that anoxia was not global during OAE 2 and that important regional differences in redox conditions existed. A lack of correlation with calcium, lithium, and carbon isotope records suggests that neither enhanced global weathering nor carbon burial was a dominant control on the I/Ca proxy during OAE 2.",

These records suggest a dramatic perturbation of the carbon cycle that has been linked to the transfer of juvenile carbon from the endogenic to the exogenic reservoirs. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the Toarcian CIE varies significantly from one substrate to another, hence complicating mass balance evaluation of the potential driving mechanisms. Here we show, using high-resolution, paired records of \u03b413Ctotal organic carbon (TOC) and hydrogen index from the Denkingen core and Dotternhausen quarry (Germany), that the amplitude of the negative CIE in marine organic matter is considerably exaggerated by changes in organic matter sourcing. Our corrected 3\u20134\u2030 CIE implies a constant carbon isotope fractionation between organic and carbonate carbon across the T-OAE and may point to a prominent role of cyanobacteria as organic matter producers during the Early Jurassic. These results also suggest that the difference between inorganic and organic carbon isotope values in marine strata constitutes a poor proxy of pCO2 levels across the T-OAE. Moreover, this corrected 3\u20134\u2030 CIE, together with evidence for >5\u00b0C seawater warming across the T-OAE, point to the input of >25,000\u2009Gt C with much more 13C-enriched signature than previously modeled. Our results thus allow reconciling inorganic and organic \u03b413C records of the T-OAE and have important implications for the evaluation of their causal mechanisms.",

Model simulations suggest that wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean can liberate 13C-depleted carbon from the abyss, causing atmospheric CO2 to increase and the \u03b413C of CO2 to decrease. One prediction of the Southern Ocean hypothesis is that water mass tracers in the deep South Atlantic should register a circulation response early in the deglaciation. Here we test this idea using a depth transect of 12 cores from the Brazil Margin. We show that records below 2300\u2009m remained 13C-depleted until 15\u2009kyr B.P. or later, indicating that the abyssal South Atlantic was an unlikely source of light carbon to the atmosphere during HS1. Benthic \u03b418O results are consistent with abyssal South Atlantic isolation until 15\u2009kyr B.P., in contrast to shallower sites. The depth dependent timing of the \u03b418O signal suggests that correcting \u03b418O for ice volume is problematic on glacial terminations. New data from 2700 to 3000\u2009m show that the deep SW Atlantic was isotopically distinct from the abyss during HS1. As a result, we find that mid-depth \u03b413C minima were most likely driven by an abrupt drop in \u03b413C of northern component water. Low \u03b413C at the Brazil Margin also coincided with an ~80\u2030 decrease in \u039414C. Our results are consistent with a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and point toward a northern hemisphere trigger for the initial rise in atmospheric CO2 during HS1.",

        "description": "\n\nMuch uncertainty exists about the state of the oceanic and atmospheric circulation in the tropical Pacific over the last glacial cycle. Studies have been hampered by the fact that sediment cores suitable for study were concentrated in the western and eastern parts of the tropical Pacific, with little information from the central tropical Pacific. Here we present information from a suite of sediment cores collected from the Line Islands Ridge in the central tropical Pacific, which show sedimentation rates and stratigraphies suitable for paleoceanographic investigations. Based on the radiocarbon and oxygen isotope measurements on the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber, we construct preliminary age models for selected cores and show that the gradient in the oxygen isotope ratio of G. ruber between the equator and 8\u00b0N is enhanced during glacial stages relative to interglacial stages. This stronger gradient could reflect enhanced equatorial cooling (perhaps reflecting a stronger Walker circulation) or an enhanced salinity gradient (perhaps reflecting increased rainfall in the central tropical Pacific).",

        "description": "\n\nThe depth of equatorial Pacific thermocline is diagnostic of the main modes of tropical climates. Past estimates of Pacific thermocline dynamics have been reconstructed either for the Last Glacial Maximum or on longer timescales at low resolution. Here we document a new high-resolution set of reconstructed past sea surface and subsurface waters temperatures from the southwestern subequatorial Pacific, core MD05-2930, in the Gulf of Papua, over the last 800\u2009ka. We used two morphotypes of Globigerinoides ruber known to live at different water depths to reconstruct past stratification. We estimated calcification temperature of each morphotypes by Mg/Ca paleothermometry. Our subequatorial Pacific thermocline paleotemperature record indicates a response of the thermocline to both direct orbital forcing and glacial-interglacial changes. Our stratification record shows a systematic shallower glacial thermocline, whereas sea surface temperatures are characterized by precessional forcing. The record is indicative of a progressive long-term shoaling of the thermocline during the glacial stages during the late Pleistocene. The shoaling of the subequatorial Pacific thermocline is consistent with regional estimates. An enhanced South Pacific shallow overturning wind-driven circulation could have driven this progressive shoaling. We speculate that this late Pleistocene glacial shoaling of the thermocline could be related to an increase in the amplitude of the obliquity.",

        "description": "\n\nThe North Atlantic subtropical gyre (STG) circulates warm waters between 10 and 40\u00b0N and is a potential area of heat storage during periods of reduced North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), when warm salt-rich waters are retained in the subtropics. In this study, we investigated multicentennial to millennial scale changes in subtropical North Atlantic hydrography in response to AMOC changes during the last deglaciation and early Holocene, using sediment cores MD08-3180 and GEOFAR KF16. The coring site (38\u00b0N) is situated near the boundary between transitional eastern North Atlantic waters and STG waters that is formed by the Azores Front. Hydrographic changes are reconstructed using new stable isotope data of benthic and subsurface dwelling planktonic foraminifera, Mg/Ca measurements on planktonic foraminifera, and planktonic foraminifera abundances that are supplemented with published sea surface temperature and stable isotope data. These multiproxy data indicate a close coupling between the latitudinal position of the northern STG boundary and deglacial AMOC modes. During weak AMOC phases (Heinrich event 1, Younger Dryas (YD), 8.2\u2009ka event), Northern Hemisphere subpolar water reached down to the northern STG boundary, displacing the boundary southward. During the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warm period, a strong warming trend of the subtropical region to 19\u00b0C is observed. A cooling of the sea surface temperature by 6\u00b0C during the YD is accompanied by ongoing northward transport of warm subsurface water that might have contributed to the restart of AMOC.",

The initial stage of the dissolution process, which is not recognizable from the surface structure of the tests, was quantitatively evaluated by X-ray microcomputed tomography (XMCT). XMCT revealed three distinct test structures: early-developed calcite formed during the juvenile stage of G. bulloides, an inner calcite layer, and an outer calcite layer. The test ultrastructure was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and CT number evaluated the density distribution in the test. The early-developed calcite and inner calcite layer had low CT numbers (500\u20131300; low density, porous) and were sensitive to dissolution, whereas the outer calcite layer had high CT numbers (<1300; high density) and resisted dissolution. Both the modes and the frequencies of the CT numbers decreased with progress of dissolution. Changes in the CT number histogram with progress of dissolution were quantified in terms of the percentage of calcite volume accounted for by low-density calcite (%\u2009Low-CT-number calcite). A clear linear relationship (R2\u2009=\u20090.87) between %\u2009Low-CT-number calcite and %\u2009Test weight loss was found. This relationship indicates that the amount of test dissolution can be estimated from the distribution of CT numbers. We propose that XMCT measurements will be useful for quantitatively estimating the amount of carbonate loss from foraminiferal tests by dissolution.",

        "description": "\n\nDuring the Miocene prominent oxygen isotope events (Mi-events) reflect major changes in glaciation, while carbonate isotope maxima (CM-events) reflect changes in organic carbon burial, particularly during the Monterey carbon isotope excursion. However, despite their importance to the global climate history they have never been recorded in shallow marine carbonate successions. The Decontra section on the Maiella Platform (central Apennines, Italy), however, allows to resolve them for the first time in such a setting during the early to middle Miocene. The present study improves the stratigraphic resolution of parts of the Decontra section via orbital tuning of high-resolution gamma ray (GR) and magnetic susceptibility data to the 405\u2009kyr eccentricity metronome. The tuning allows, within the established biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and isotope stratigraphic frameworks, a precise correlation of the Decontra section with pelagic records of the Mediterranean region, as well as the global paleoclimatic record and the global sea level curve. Spectral series analyses of GR data further indicate that the 405\u2009kyr orbital cycle is particularly well preserved during the Monterey Event. Since GR is a direct proxy for authigenic uranium precipitation during increased burial of organic carbon in the Decontra section, it follows the same long-term orbital pacing as observed in the carbon isotope records. The 405\u2009kyr GR beat is thus correlated with the carbon isotope maxima observed during the Monterey Event. Finally, the Mi-events can now be recognized in the \u03b418O record and coincide with plankton-rich, siliceous, or phosphatic horizons in the lithology of the section.",

        "description": "\n\nApproximately synchronous with the onset of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), \u03b413C decreased throughout most of the upper (~1000\u20132500\u2009m) Atlantic, and at some deeper North Atlantic sites. This early deglacial \u03b413C decrease has been alternatively attributed to a reduced fraction of high-\u03b413C North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) or to a decrease in the NADW \u03b413C source value. Here we present new benthic \u03b418O and \u03b413C records from three relatively shallow (~1450\u20131650\u2009m) subpolar Northeast Atlantic cores. With published data from other cores, these data form a depth transect (~1200\u20133900\u2009m) in the subpolar Northeast Atlantic. We compare Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and HS1 data from this transect with data from a depth transect of cores from the Brazil Margin. The largest LGM-to-HS1 decreases in both benthic \u03b413C and \u03b418O occurred in upper waters containing the highest NADW fraction during the LGM. We show that the \u03b413C decrease can be explained entirely by a lower NADW \u03b413C source value, entirely by a decrease in the proportion of NADW relative to Southern Ocean Water, or by a combination of these mechanisms. However, building on insights from model simulations, we hypothesize that reduced ventilation due to a weakened but still active Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation also contributed to the low \u03b413C values in the upper North Atlantic. We suggest that the benthic \u03b418O gradients above ~2300\u2009m at both core transects indicate the depth to which heat and North Atlantic deglacial freshwater had mixed into the subsurface ocean by early HS1.",

        "description": "\nAstrochronology is fundamental to many paleoclimate studies, but a standard statistical test has yet to be established for validating stand-alone astronomically tuned time scales (those lacking detailed independent time control) against their astronomical insolation tuning curves. Shackleton et al. (1995) proposed that the modulation of precession's amplitude by eccentricity can be used as an independent test for the successful tuning of paleoclimate data. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that eccentricity-like amplitude modulation can be artificially generated in random data, following astronomical tuning. Here we introduce a new statistical approach that circumvents the problem of introducing amplitude modulations during tuning and data processing, thereby allowing the use of amplitude modulations for astronomical time scale evaluation. The method is based upon the use of the Hilbert transform to calculate instantaneous amplitude following application of a wide band precession filter and subsequent low-pass filtering of the instantaneous amplitude to extract potential eccentricity modulations. Statistical significance of the results is evaluated using phase-randomized surrogates that preserve the power spectrum structure of the data but have randomized amplitude modulations. Application of the new testing algorithm to two astronomically tuned data sets demonstrates the efficacy of the technique and confirms the presence of astronomical signals. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a minimal tuning approach using (at maximum) one precession cycle per ~100\u2009kyr eccentricity cycle does not introduce systematic frequency modulations, even when a narrow band-pass filter is applied, allowing direct comparison of data amplitudes and orbital eccentricity.",

        "description": "\n\nWe have employed a regional Massachusetts Institute of Technology oceanic general circulation model of the Red Sea to investigate its circulation during marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e, the peak of the last interglacial, approximately 125\u2009ka before present. Compared to present-day conditions, MIS 5e was characterized by higher Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, accompanied by increases in air temperature of more than 2\u00b0C and global sea level approximately 8\u2009m higher than today. As a consequence of the increased seasonality, intensified monsoonal conditions with increased winds, rainfall, and humidity in the Red Sea region are evident in speleothem records and supported by model simulations. To assess the dominant factors responsible for the observed changes, we conducted several sensitivity experiments in which the MIS 5 boundary conditions or forcing parameters were used individually. Overall, our model simulation for the last interglacial maximum reconstructs a Red Sea that is colder, less ventilated and probably more oligotrophic than at present day. The largest alteration in Red Sea circulation and properties was found for the simulation of the northward displacement and intensification of the African tropical rain belt during MIS 5e, leading to a notable increase in the fresh water flux into the Red Sea. Such an increase significantly reduced the Red Sea salinity and exchange volume of the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. The Red Sea reacted to the MIS 5e insolation forcing by the expected increase in seasonal sea surface temperature amplitude and overall cooling caused by lower temperatures during deep water formation in winter.",

        "description": "\n\nOver the past 13 ka, the hydrology for the southeastern Mediterranean was mainly regulated by Nile River runoff, which in turn was controlled by climate forcing. Being affected by orbital forcing, and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), planktic foraminiferal data (assemblages, stable isotopes, and size properties) indicate three major periods. (1) From 13.0 to 11.5 ka, the upper water column was well-mixed, cold, and productive. (2) From 11.5 to 6.4 ka, hydrology and foraminifers were affected by intensified monsoonal circulation. The enhanced size of Globigerinoides ruber is interpreted as a response to environmental stress caused by low-saline waters. (3) After 6.4 ka, the southward retreat of the ITCZ caused a decrease in freshwater discharge and hence a return to ecological equilibrium. A drop in foraminifer diversity from 2.9 to 1.1 ka was related to more arid conditions, and limited supply of nutrients from the Nile River. We suggest a link to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) marking the Roman Humid Period in the western Mediterranean, and in anti-phase with the southeastern Mediterranean aridity. Because Nile River runoff exerted major control on surface hydrology, a connection to Indian and Pacific climate systems partially controlling precipitation over the Nile catchment area is hypothesized. From 1.1 to 0.54 ka, high foraminifer diversity indicates humid conditions synchronous to the Medieval Climate Anomaly under a positive NAO state. Over the past 0.54 ka encompassing the Little Ice Age, another arid period is indicated by a drop in foraminifer diversity.",
