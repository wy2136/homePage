        "description": "\n\nIn this study, the three (Hsie, Krueger and Zeng) schemes that parameterize depositional growth of ice crystal are tested using Koenig and Takahashi parameters in modeling China pre-summer torrential rainfall event. The Krueger scheme with the Takahashi parameter produces the closest simulations to the observations because it increases cloud ice and snow in the upper troposphere. The increased ice hydrometeor enhances and suppresses infrared radiative cooling above and below 12 km, respectively. The suppressed infrared cooling reduces net condensation while the enhanced infrared cooling suppresses hydrometeor loss through the reduction in melting of ice hydrometeor.\n",

HWI shows higher predictability of heat waves than those of maximum temperature (TMAX) and bias corrected TMAX. The verification scores using HWI are compared to other cases of forecasts. It is concluded that the proposed HWI can be useful for heat wave forecasting, which may reduce the health impacts from heat waves through appropriate and timely mitigation efforts.\n",

Based on the records for 1981\u20132013, we show that cyclonic activity decreases dramatically during strong ENSO events: only a few cases are observed during the January-March period. This pattern is attributed to changes in large-scale thermodynamic parameters. Although El Ni\u00f1o is correlated with an increase in tropospheric moisture and sea-surface temperatures, it is also associated with an equatorward shift of the subtropical jet. When El Ni\u00f1o is sufficiently strong, the latter effect may dominate the former, inhibiting tropical cyclone activity.\n",

This high correlation may result from an oceanic bridge's effect in the Western Pacific. The mechanism may be described as follows: the atmospheric circulation anomalies of cold winters corresponds with a simultaneous warmer Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) by decreasing surface latent heat fluxes. The warmer sea surface temperature (SST) can persist and move eastward gradually to the subsequent summer through the oceanic processes, and thus in turn affect the hot days (HDs) over MLYRV.\n",

Moreover, the upper levels of the atmosphere are identified as the sensitive levels, and the sensitive areas are the areas with heavy rainfall.

The phasing and amplitude of monthly rainfall evolution and the spatial progression of the wet season onset are well simulated by the models. Notwithstanding some systematic biases in a few models, the simulated onset and end of the rainy season and their interannual variability are highly correlated with those computed from the reference data. The strongest agreements between the reference and modelled precipitation patterns are found north of about 20\u00b0S in the vicinity of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. A majority of the RCMs adequately capture the reference precipitation probability density functions, with a few showing a bias towards excessive light rainfall events.\n",

Ejections and sweeps had similar contributions to fluxes at all sites, and when decomposing this contribution in scales, the resulting spectra were narrower for the forests. When accounting for times scales from 10 to 200s, CSs contributed to approximately 80% of fluxes for Caxiuan\u00e3 forest site, with lower values for other locations. Among the forest, the contribution for the Jaru site was the lowest (\u224866%) due to peak of contribution being close to 200s.\n",

Hence, it is important to understand the possible factors that influence the structure and size of SE. Idealized simulations suggest that the environmental humidity is one of the key factors. It is favorable for TC to establish a SE in a moist environment. Furthermore, the SE is likely to be located at a larger radius, thereby leads to a wider moat area. Consequently, the structure of SE would affect TC intensity change during the eyewall replacement cycle. This study strongly motivates further researches with respect to how the environmental conditions influence the storm dynamics and thermodynamics.\n",

The results showed that surface albedo increased by \u223c23.5 and \u223c33.9% on clear and overcast days, respectively, if grassland was covered by plastic film.

Such data might be produced by traditional disdrometer instruments for recording rain drop sizes. The method is an adaptation of a log-linear generalized linear model (GLM), forming an iterative process which quickly converges to very near maximum likelihood estimates. Simulations with a Joss\u2013Waldvogel bin regime show that the estimator has little bias. Application to observed data from two different types of disdrometers yields results practically equal to published maximum likelihood estimates.\n",

The strength of coupling varies geographically over different monsoon phases. The coupling strength over the entire monsoon period is primarily attributed to the monsoon mature phase with strong signal of coupling in the eastern NAM region. A decomposition of the land\u2013atmosphere coupling suggests that land segment contributes to the strong coupling during the monsoon onset, mature phase and the overall monsoon season, while the atmospheric segment dominates the strong coupling during the decay phase.\n",

Out-of-sample comparisons between infilled and observed climate data for 53 stations in northeastern Canada suggests that mean absolute errors using the proposed method are \u00b11 and \u00b10.5 \u00b0C on monthly and annual timescales, respectively. Evaluation of several gridded data sets used to guide infilling suggests that ERA-Interim (ERAI) and modern-era retrospective reanalysis (MERRA) reanalyses are the most suitable for this purpose in the Labrador-Ungava region.\n",

        "description": "\n\nBesides improving the understanding of the physics of the challenging problem of monsoon prediction, it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of the input parameters used in models. Sea-surface temperature (SST) is the only oceanographic parameter applied in most of the monsoon forecasting models, which many times do not represent the heat energy available to the atmosphere. We studied the impacts of ocean mean temperature (OMT), representing the heat energy of the upper ocean, and SST on the all India summer monsoon rainfall through a statistical relation during 1993\u20132013 and found that OMT has a better link than SST.\n",

The introduction of a new model version mostly randomly affects individual model projections, but models also show some generation-independent characteristics which can potentially serve a basis for model weighting. Mean values of temperature and pressure change differ significantly between the model generations only over limited regions, mainly near the sea-ice edge. If multi-model ensembles are uniformly weighted, the efforts of model development are not completely exploited.\n",

Here, we provide a synthesis of recent data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellite to detect the rainfall maxima depth versus duration across the terrestrial surface since 1998. Observations with rain gauges and satellite merged products suggest similarities in the power scaling law between maximum rainfall depth and duration. Satellites have shown the potential to identify regions of extreme precipitation and this is the first study where intensity-duration curves from rainfall events measured by satellites are compared with the same curves obtained with traditional rain gauges.\n",
