        "description": "\n\nIntensive irrigation in northwest India has led to growing concerns over the sustainability of current and future groundwater abstraction. Environmental tracers and measurements of groundwater residence times can help quantify the renewal processes. Results from 16 paired locations show that the interquartile ranges for residence times in shallow alluvial groundwater (8\u201350 m deep) to be 1\u201350 years and significantly less than those from deeper groundwater (76\u2013160 m deep) at 40\u2013170 years. The widespread occurrence of modern tracers in deep groundwater (>60% of sites had >10% modern recharge) suggests that there is low aquifer anisotropy and that deep aquifers are recharged by a significant component of recent recharge via vertical leakage. Stable isotope and noble gas results at all depths conform to modern meteoric sources and annual average temperatures, with no evidence of significant regional recharge from canal leakage in this study area close to the Himalayas.\n",

        "description": "\n\nDrought persistence in West-African Sahel has often been explained as an effect of positive vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks associated with surface albedo or the partitioning of solar radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes. An often overlooked aspect of land-atmosphere coupling results from vegetation controls on dust emissions and the ability of mineral aerosols to suppress precipitation. Here we first consider the case of local (endogenous) dynamics within the Sahel, whereby enhanced dust emissions resulting from a decrease in vegetation partly suppress precipitation, thereby further reducing vegetation cover. We then account for teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and exogenous (i.e., Saharan) dust emissions due to an increase in Saharan wind speed in years of above average Sahel precipitation. We find that in both cases vegetation-climate dynamics may have two stable states, one with low precipitation and high concentration of atmospheric dust, and the other with high precipitation and lower levels of atmospheric dust.\n",

We address this problem via positron emission tomography using 11C nuclides and apply it to tight formations - a difficult but relevant rock type to investigate. The results represent an important technical advancement for visualization and quantification of flow properties in ultra-tight rocks and allowed us to observe that local rock structure in a layered, reservoir shale (K\u2009=\u20090.74 \u03bcD) sample dictated the CO2 flow path by the presence of high-density layers. Diffusive transport of CO2 in a fractured sample (high-permeable sandstone) was also visualized and an effective diffusion coefficient (Di\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00b7\u200910\u22128\u2009m2/s) was derived directly from the dynamic distribution of CO2.

Measurement of its intensity (kTp) has long been used for their study [Yngvesson and Perkins, 1968; Cicerone, 1974]. At night, absent any other excitation mechanism, the PL intensity should have a thermal amplitude level kTe, determined by the electron gas temperature Te. To the contrary Carlson et al. [1982] found nighttime PLs over Arecibo enhanced >3 times above thermal intensities despite the absence of any known causative mechanism. Here we present discovery that nighttime PLs frequently recur, with quite variable enhancement. In the absence of direct solar EUV, these enhanced PLs must be produced by particle precipitation, manifested by the presence of variable recurring F-region ~10s eV electron fluxes. We see this as offering a new tool for space environment studies, opening a new era of particle precipitation research and ISR calibration.\n",

Here we show how J\u22a5,df can be expressed as the total horizontal current J\u22a5 minus its curl-free component, the latter being completely determined by the global Birkeland current pattern. Thus in regions where J\u22a5=0, the global Birkeland current distribution alone determines the local magnetic perturbation. We show with observations from ground and space that in the polar cap, the ground magnetic field perturbations tend to align with the Birkeland current contribution in darkness but not in sunlight. We also show that in sunlight, the magnetic perturbations are typically such that the equivalent overhead current is anti-parallel to the convection, indicating that the Hall current system dominates. Thus the ground magnetic field in the polar cap relates to different current systems in sunlight and in darkness.\n",

Here we use a combination of observations and reanalysis datasets to show that the strengthened contrasts in winter mean temperatures and extremes across North America are closely related to an enhancement of the positive Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern during the second half of the twentieth century. Recent intensification of positive PNA events is associated with amplified planetary waves over North America, driving cold-air outbreaks into the southeast and warm tropical/subtropical air into the northwest. This not only results in a strengthened winter mean temperature contrast, but increases the occurrence of the opposite-signed extremes in these two regions.\n",

Here we compare biogeochemical surface-sediment properties from a fluid-dynamically well characterised abyssal hill and upstream plain: (1) In hill sediments, organic-carbon and -nitrogen contents are only about half as high as on the plain while proteinaceous material displays less degradation; (2) on the hill, more coarse-grained sediments (reducing particle surface area) and very variable calcite contents (influencing particle surface charge) are proposed to reduce the extent, and influence compound-specificity, of sorptive organic-matter preservation. Further studies are needed to estimate the representativeness of the results in a global context.

The layers were traced back to observed dust storm activity near the edge of the north polar ice cap where simulated surface winds exceeded the threshold for dust lifting by saltation. Heating of the atmospheric dust by solar radiation caused buoyant instability and mixing across the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Differential advection by wind shear created detached dust layers above the PBL that ascended due to radiative heating and arrived at the Phoenix site at heights corresponding to the LIDAR observations. The self-lifting of the dust layers is similar to the \u201csolar escalator\u201d mechanism for aerosol layers in the Earth's stratosphere.\n",

Low velocity anomalies observed in the cold subducted slabs have been related to the unusual shear wave velocities of lawsonite eclogite. However, electrical conductivity of lawsonite at high pressure and temperature remains unknown. In this study, we measured the electrical conductivity of lawsonite at 7 GPa, and temperatures ranging from 298 K- 1320 K. At 1173 K, the electrical conductivity of lawsonite is around 10-1 S/m. A sharp increase of electrical conductivity is observed at temperatures exceeding the dehydration ~1258 K. The high electrical conductivity up to 101 S/m observed in our experiments is due to the presence of highly conductivity fluid and could explain the low resistivity observed at 150-250 km depths in subduction zone settings such as NE-Japan, northern, and central Chile.\n",

To examine the effect of rock type and depth on the distribution of earthquakes, we compare geologic models of the San Francisco Bay and the southern California regions to the distribution of seismicity. We normalize the number of earthquakes within each rock type and depth interval by the corresponding volume to determine the earthquake density. Earthquake density is determined primarily by depth, while whether the rock is sedimentary or basement has only a secondary, depth-dependent effect on the earthquake density. At very shallow depths there is no difference in earthquake density between sedimentary and basement rocks. The earthquake density of basement rocks increases with depth more rapidly than that of sedimentary rocks to a similar but shallower maximum.\n",

Here we present a subglacial hydrological analysis of a land-terminating sector of the GrIS at unprecedented resolution that predicts the routing of surface-derived meltwater once it has entered the basal drainage system. Our analysis indicates the probable existence of small subglacial lakes that remain undetectable by methods using surface elevation change or radar techniques. Furthermore, the analysis suggests transient behavior with rapid switching of subglacial drainage between competing catchments driven by seasonal changes in the basal water pressure. Our findings provide a cautionary note that should be considered in studies that attempt to relate and infer future response from surface temperature, melt, and runoff from point measurements and/or modeling with measurements of proglacial discharge and ice dynamics.\n",

In this study, we show evidence of a fragile hydrological equilibrium in the western Amazon. While drainage systems located near the equator and the western Amazon do not show water deficit in years with average climate conditions, this equilibrium can be broken during drought events. More importantly, we show that this effect is persistent, taking years until the normal hydrological patterns are reestablished. We show clear links between persistent changes in forest canopy structure and changes in hydrological patterns, revealing physical evidence of hydrological mechanisms that may lead to permanent changes in parts of the Amazon ecosystem. If prospects of increasing drought frequency are confirmed, a change in the current hydro-ecological patterns in the western Amazon could take place in less than a decade.\n",

Quantitative assessment of induced seismic hazard, however, requires estimating the maximum possible magnitude earthquake that may be induced during fluid injection. Here I seek constraints on an upper limit for the largest possible earthquake using source-physics simulations that consider rate-and-state friction and hydro-mechanical interaction along a straight homogeneous fault. Depending on the orientation of the pressurized fault in the ambient stress field, different rupture behavior can occur: 1) uncontrolled rupture-front propagation beyond the pressure front, or 2) rupture-front propagation arresting at the pressure front. In the first case, fault properties determine the earthquake magnitude, and the upper magnitude limit may be similar to natural earthquakes. In the second case, the maximum magnitude can be controlled by carefully designing and monitoring injection, and thus restricting the pressurized fault area.\n",

We assess atmospheric and oceanic drivers responsible for this extreme event. In terms of atmospheric drivers, mild Bothnian Bay winters are characterized by positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) associated with the advection of air from the North Atlantic. In winter 2014/15, NAO was at a record high level and resulted in a northerly storm track associated with vigorous southwesterlies that drove ice towards the northeastern end of the bay. Furthermore, we found that the 1985-2015 Baltic Sea ice extent distribution differs from any other preceding thirty-winter period since 1720 with a high confidence. Based on climate projections, it is very likely that in the next fifty years partially ice-free Bothnian Bay will go from being an extremely rare event to a new normal.\n",

Global salinity data from Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis highlight surface ocean salinity trends in evaporative-dominated subtropical gyre systems over the period of 1950\u20132010. Global salinity observations from NASA's Aquarius and ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions were used with relation to more recent trends and future implications on global water cycle studies. Results indicated an average salinity increase of 0.12 psu in the subtropical gyres over the 61-year study, with the greatest increase occurring in the southern hemisphere gyres. Lateral gyre drift was also inferred through salinity, as three of five gyres showed significant drift over 60\u2009years within their respective basins. There is evidence of periodicity related to these migrations on multi-decadal timescales. A comparison of satellite, in situ, and model simulations was conducted in an effort to resolve the near-surface salinity stratification as it pertains specifically to the subtropical gyre regions, and also to show the growing relevance of satellite data in global water cycle studies.\n",

Impingement of warm-core rings at the shelfbreak generates along-isobath intrusions that grow like Pinocchio's nose, extending hundreds of kilometers to the southwest. By combining satellite and Ocean Observatory Initiative Pioneer Array data and idealized numerical simulations, we discover that the intrusion results from topographically induced vorticity variation of the ring water, rather than from entrainment of the shelfbreak frontal jet. This intrusion of the Gulf Stream ring water has important biogeochemical implications and could facilitate migration of marine species across the shelfbreak barrier and transport low-nutrient surface Gulf Stream ring water to the otherwise productive shelfbreak region.\n",

These increases are predominantly controlled by the super-Clausius-Clapeyron rate of increase of atmospheric water vapor with warming, while changes of winds that transport moisture in the ARs, or dynamical effect, mostly counter the thermodynamical effect of increasing water vapor, limiting the increase of AR events in the future.

The array recorded continuous data for approximately two weeks and presents an unprecedented seismic observation of an active volcano. A reverse-time imaging method is applied to short-term-average over long-term-average time series data to automatically detect and locate microseismicity. These efforts resulted in an order of magnitude increase in earthquake detections over the normal monitoring operations of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Earthquake locations resolve a narrow, \u22641 km wide, vertical lineament of seismicity which extends from the surface to 4 km depth directly beneath the summit crater. This feature is interpreted as a fracture network that acts as conduit connecting an underlying magma chamber to the surface.\n",

We examine ARTEMIS dual-spacecraft observations of a long-duration magnetotail exhaust generated by anti-parallel reconnection in conjunction with Particle-In-Cell simulations, showing spatial variations in the anisotropy across the outflow far (> 100di) downstream of the X-line.

The plasma is well-above the firehose threshold within patchy spatial regions at |BX|\u2009\u2208\u2009[0.1,\u20090.5]B0, suggesting that the drive for the instability is strong and the instability is too weak to relax the anisotropy.

We use a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and place a dipole magnetic field at the center of the Moon to mimic the induced magnetic field, which is the response of the lunar interior to the time-varying interplanetary magnetic field. Consistent with previous observations and theoretical predictions, we show that the induced magnetic fields on the dayside are confined within the lunar surface through a dayside current sheet. In contrast to previous work, we show that the induced magnetic fields are not confined in the lunar wake, and they leak out, sometimes even appearing as lunar limb compressions.

Symmetrical bifurcations were often found to be unstable so that one branch downstream of the bifurcation enlarged whilst the other dwindled. A unified theory able to predict bifurcation stability in both gravel- and sand-bed rivers is still lacking. Here we develop a new theory for the stability of bifurcations for the entire range of gravel- to sand-bed rivers. The theory indicates opposite behavior of gravel- and sand-bed rivers: we predict that symmetrical bifurcations are inherently stable for intermediate Shields stresses, but are inherently unstable for the low and high Shields stresses found in the majority of rivers on Earth. In the latter conditions asymmetrical bifurcations are stable. These predictions are corroborated by observations and have ramifications for many environmental problems in fluvio-deltaic settings.\n",

The extratropical oceans are thought to exert noticeable feedbacks on the atmosphere especially on decadal and longer time scales, yet the large-scale atmospheric response to anomalous extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) is still under debate. Here we show, by means of dedicated high-resolution atmospheric model experiments, that sufficient daily variability in the extratropical background SST needs to be resolved to force a statistically significant large-scale atmospheric response to decadal North Pacific SST anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which is consistent with observations. The large-scale response is mediated by atmospheric eddies. This implies that daily extratropical SST fluctuations must be simulated by the ocean components and resolved by the atmospheric components of global climate models to enable realistic simulation of decadal North Pacific sector climate variability.\n",

We have identified several TGF-associated lightning radio emissions in which the altitudes of in-cloud lightning leader pulses that precede and follow the TGF can be measured. We combine these with high-absolute-timing accuracy TGF observations from the Fermi satellite to determine the development of the lightning channel before, during, and after the TGF production. All of these TGFs were produced several milliseconds after the leader had initiated and when the leaders reached 1\u20132 km in length. After the TGFs, the leaders all continued to ascend forseveral more km with no dramatic change in their characteristics, although they all exhibited high average velocities of 0.8\u20131.0\u00d7106 m/s.

The CloudNet pixel is small enough to detect cumuliform cloud overlap. Cloud fraction masks are derived for five different cases, using gridded time-height datasets at various temporal and vertical resolutions. The overlap ratio (R), i.e. the ratio between cloud fraction by volume and by area, is studied as a function of the vertical resolution. Good agreement is found between R derived from observations and simulations. An inverse linear function is found to best describe the observed overlap behavior, confirming previous LES results. Simulated and observed decorrelation lengths are smaller (~300 m) than previously reported (> 1km).

In particular, fluid distribution in subduction zones influences earthquake occurrence, and it varies among subduction zones due to variations in fluid sources such as hydrated oceanic plates. However, the relationship between variations in fluid distribution and variations in seismicity among subduction zones is unclear. Here, we divide Earth's subduction zones into 111 regions and estimate background seismicity rates using the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. We demonstrate that background seismicity rate correlates to the amount of bending of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the hydration of oceanic plates via slab-bending-related faults. Regions with large bending may have high seismicity rates because a strongly hydrated oceanic plate causes high pore-fluid pressure and reduces the strength of the plate interface. We suggest that variations in fluid distribution can also cause variations in seismicity in subduction zones.\n",

Of 60 such events from 1900 to present, 42 have occurred in the middle half of each year. The seasonality appears strongest in the northwest Pacific subduction zones, and weakest in the Tonga region. Taken at face value, the surplus of summer events is statistically significant, but due to the ex post facto hypothesis testing, the absence of seasonality in smaller deep earthquakes, and the lack of a known physical triggering mechanism, we cannot rule out that the observed seasonality is just random chance. However, we can make a testable prediction of seasonality in future large deep-focus earthquakes, which, given likely earthquake occurrence rates, should be verified or falsified within a few decades.

These particles are interpreted as clusters of molecules, most likely water, which we refer to as nanograins because their inferred diameters are less than one hundred nm.

However, the entrainment velocity can deviate from the evaporative-cooling trend and even become insensitive to variations in the inversion properties. Here, the efficiency of evaporative cooling at amplifying the entrainment velocity is quantified by means of direct numerical simulations of a cloud-top mixing layer. We demonstrate that variations in the efficiency modulate the effect of evaporative cooling on entrainment, explaining the different trends. These variations are associated with the evaporation of droplets in cloud holes bellow the inversion point. The parametrization of the efficiency provides the evaporative amplification of the entrainment velocity as a function of a single parameter that characterizes the inversion. The resulting entrainment velocities match our experiments and previous measurements to within \u00b125%.

Here we probe lowermost mantle anisotropy near the Perm Anomaly using the differential splitting of SKS and SKKS phases measured at stations in Europe. We find evidence for lowermost mantle anisotropy in the vicinity of the Perm Anomaly, with geographic trends hinting at lateral variations in anisotropy across the boundaries of the Perm Anomaly as well as across a previously unsampled portion of the African LLSVP border. Our observations suggest that deformation is concentrated at the boundaries of both the Perm Anomaly and the African LLSVP.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOne of the major challenges pertaining to extreme geomagnetic storms is to understand the basic processes associated with the development of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere currents, which generate large induced surface geoelectric fields. Previous studies point out the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements during extreme storms. We examined induced global geoelectric fields derived from ground-based magnetometer recordings for 12 extreme geomagnetic storms between the years 1982\u20132005. For the present study two important extreme storms, October 29, 2003 and March 13, 1989, are shown. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide further evidence on the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements, and to show that the structure of the geoelectric field during these localized extremes at single sites can differ greatly from globally and regionally averaged fields. Although the physical processes that govern the development of these localized extremes are still not clear, we discuss some possible causes.\n",

In particular, a reconstructed \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a-like\u201d pattern during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) has been widely tied to medieval droughts in southwest North America. This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model (GCM) simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Ni\u00f1a-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) ensemble. Our results caution against drawing dynamical interpretations from a single CFR, and affirm the importance of developing CFRs through improved statistical methodology and community-driven proxy syntheses.\n",

The most notable variability associated with the AO/NAO was a northeast/southwest dipole feature across western Eurasia.

Roots show an extraordinary architectural complexity that recalls their remarkable ability to adapt to environmental heterogeneity, resources availability, and climate. In fluvial environments, phreatophytes and hydrophytes cope with flow and sediment processes, and hydro- and areotropism are the main drivers for root growth. In this work, we show how the vertical root density distribution in riparian plants is the result of how plants respond to the random fluctuations of river flows. A root dataset from field and controlled outdoor experiments is used in combination with a physically-based analytical model to demonstrate that the root vertical density distribution can be ascribed to the interplay of randomness and determinism in a simple mathematical form. The shape of the distribution reflects the profitability of plant roots to grow in different soil layers depending on the soil moisture availability. For the first time, this model helps understanding in an analytical manner the adaptation strategy of plant roots to different scenarios, paving the way for the comprehension of the effects of future changes in climate and environmental conditions.\n",

In addition, an opposing dawn-dusk asymmetry in the suprathermal plasma pressure adjacent to the magnetopause has been observed. This probably acts to reduce the size asymmetry and may explain the discrepancy between the degree of asymmetry found here and a similar asymmetry found by [12] using MHD simulations. Finally, these observations sample a wide range of season, allowing the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 polar flattening (14\u00b11%) caused by the magnetodisc to be separated from the seasonally induced north-south asymmetry in the magnetopause shape found theoretically (5\u00b11% when the planet's magnetic dipole is tilted away from the Sun by 10-17\u00b0).\n",

By combining our observations with a two-dimensional atmospheric chemistry-transport model, we infer an increase in global emissions from 240 t yr\u20131 in 2000 to 840 t yr\u20131 in 2011-2012, followed by a relatively fast decline to 570 t yr\u20131 in 2014. Emissions of HCFC-31 originate most probably from intermediate product release during the manufacturing process of HFC-32 (CH2F2). The rapid decline in recent years could be due to changes in production methods rather than declines in diffusive sources such as landfills or HCFC-31 contaminations in merchandised HFC-32.\n",

Field excitation was monitored by the reference measurements in the near zone of the transmitter, which are free of the ionospheric influence. It is found that the amplitude of the field at the remote points varied depending on the solar illumination and solar elevation angle. We suppose that this effect was probably caused by the increase in the effective height of the ionospheric D-layer, just as it was previously observed in VLF. The obtained results demonstrate the response of the propagating extremely low frequency (ELF, 3\u2013300 Hz) wave to the change in the ionospheric boundary.

Abruptly slipping regions propagate along the fault at nearly the shear wave speed. We propose that the dramatic reduction in frictional strength implied by this pulse-like rupture behavior has a common mechanism to the weakening reported in high velocity friction experiments performed on rotary machines. The slip pulses can also be identified as migrating sources of high frequency seismic waves. As observations from large earthquakes show similar propagating high frequency sources, the pulses described here may have relevance to the mechanics of larger earthquakes.\n",

Based on plate reconstruction and recent ocean drilling within the Izu-Bonin-Mariana, we advance a new geodynamic model of subduction initiation (SI). We argue that the close juxtaposition of the nascent plate boundary with relic oceanic arcs is a key factor localizing initiation of this new subduction zone. The combination of thermal and compositional density contrasts between the overriding relic arc and the adjacent old Pacific oceanic plate promoted spontaneous SI. We suggest that thermal rejuvenation of the overriding plate just before 50 Ma causes a reduction in overriding plate strength and an increase in the age contrast (hence buoyancy) between the two plates, leading to SI. The computational models map out a framework in which rejuvenated relic arcs are a favorable tectonic environment for promoting subduction initiation, while transform faults and passive margins are not.\n",

The timing of the excess emission is consistent with a major dust release episode \u2272 20 kyr ago, possibly due to Encke progenitor breakup [Clube and Napier, 1984; Jenniskens, 2007].

In contrast, the models almost everywhere project greater warming of once-per-year minimum temperatures as compared to mean daily minimum winter temperatures. Under projected changes associated with extremes of the temperature distribution, Baltimore's maximum temperature that was met or exceeded once-per-year historically is projected to occur 17 times per season by mid-century, a 28% increase relative to projections based on summer mean daily maximum temperature change.

The models are generally able to capture observed geopotential height anomalies associated with temperature extremes in two subregions. Projected changes in extreme temperature events cannot be explained by lower boundary conditions as reflected by soil moisture anomalies or snow water equivalent.\n",

In the North Pacific, contrasting anomalies were also present, with a straight zonal Pacific jet in 2010 and a strong poleward deviation of the Pacific jet in its exit region in 2014. Using reanalysis data sets and adopting a nonlinear initial-value approach with a quasi-geostrophic model, we show that the Pacific-North American anomalies are responsible for shaping synoptic wave trains propagating across North America. This in turn largely determines the nature of wave breaking and the synoptic eddy feedback onto the mean flow in the North Atlantic and finally the NAO phase. In such a proposed mechanism, synoptic wave activity forms the cornerstone of the dynamical relationship between the North Pacific and North Atlantic large-scale anomalies during the contrasting winters of 2010 and 2014.\n",

Gravity waves vary in the three spatial dimensions and time, so the ideal measurement observes all three dimensions at high resolution nearly simultaneously. High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) measurements give near-simultaneous profiles in close proximity and at high vertical resolution, but these coincident profiles lie only along the plane of the measurement track. Here we combine HIRDLS and radio occultation data sets to obtain three-dimensional properties of gravity waves on a global scale as well as seasonal variations. The results show dramatic changes from previous estimates using either data set alone. Changes include much larger momentum fluxes and latitudinal variations in propagation direction that support an enhanced role for gravity wave forcing of middle atmosphere circulation.\n",

Specifically, after being launched at the northern auroral region on the dayside, this wave propagated equatorward with phase speeds on the order of \u223c720\u00a0m/s and finally almost traveled around the Earth once horizontally in the thermosphere prior to dissipation. The time taken to dissipate is about 15.5\u00a0h. It is the farthest-traveling large-scale gravity wave currently tracked by satellite measurements, made possible by a sudden injection of energy in an unusually clean propagation environment.

Usually, the ensemble size of EnKF is determined with limited sensitivity experiments. Thus, the optimal ensemble size may have never been reached. In this work, based on a series of mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that the maximum efficiency of the EnKF for assimilating observations into the models could be reached when the ensemble size is set to 12. Simulation experiments are designed in this study under ensemble size cases 2, 5, 12, 30, 50, 100, and 300 to support the mathematical derivations. All the simulations are conducted from 1 June to 30 September 2012 over southeast USA (from \u221290\u00b0W, 30\u00b0N to \u221280\u00b0W, 40\u00b0N) at 25\u2009km resolution.

These features occur within the shallow (~20\u2009m depth) pycnocline separating cold, dilute, surface meltwater from near-freezing, salty, winter-formed waters beneath the pycnocline. An idealized numerical model suggests that the features arise from eddies and meanders generated by instability of the surface front separating meltwater from Bering Sea Water. Warm Bering Sea Water is transported across the front and into the pycnocline by the cross-frontal velocities associated with the instabilities. The accompanying lateral eddy heat fluxes may be important both in summer for promoting ice melt and in fall by delaying the onset of ice formation over portions of this shelf. Lateral heat flux magnitudes depend upon the stratification of the Bering Sea Water.\n",

The results indicate that significant levels of total reactive iodine (0.25\u20130.7\u2009parts per trillion by volume), between 2 and 5 times larger than the accepted upper limits, can be injected into the stratosphere via tropical convective outflow. At these iodine levels, modeled iodine catalytic cycles account for up to 30% of the contemporary ozone loss in the tropical lower stratosphere and can exert a stratospheric ozone depletion potential equivalent to, or even larger than, that of very short-lived bromocarbons.

A challenge for traditional InSAR has been its limited spatial and temporal coverage especially for very large events, whose dimensions exceed the typical swath width of 70\u2013100\u2009km. This problem is addressed by the ALOS-2 satellite, whose PALSAR-2 instrument operates in ScanSAR mode, enabling a repeat time of 2\u2009weeks and a swath width of 350\u2009km. Here we present InSAR line-of-sight displacement data from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 observations covering the Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake and its Mw 7.3 aftershock that were acquired within 1\u2009week of each event. The data are made freely available and we encourage their use in models of the fault slip and associated stress changes. The Mw 7.3 aftershock not only extended the rupture area of the main shock toward the east but also left a 20\u2009km gap where the fault has little or no coseismic slip. We estimate this unslipped fault patch has the potential to generate a Mw 6.9 event.\n",

This study contributes to the ongoing debate of the physical reasons for this difference, through the use of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Feature (PF) database. We demonstrate that tropical oceanic PFs with lightning tend to be over 10 times larger and more mature than those over land. This relationship is most pronounced in archetypal land and ocean regimes (Congo and Central Pacific) and is also manifested throughout the entire (35\u00b0S to 35\u00b0N) TRMM domain, to varying extents. This relationship holds true when we select for PFs with 40\u00a0dBZ echo tops over at least 5.5\u00a0km in height, which continues to be an effective proxy for convective intensity and probability of lightning.\n",

Decadal variability of western Amazon hydroclimate is highly correlated to the Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) north-south gradient (NSG). Shifts of dry and wet events frequencies are also related to the NSG phase, with a 66% chance of 3+\u2009years of dry events per decade when NSG\u2009>\u20090 and 19% when NSG\u2009<\u20090. The western Amazon and NSG decadal covariability is well reproduced in general circulation models (GCMs) historical (HIST) and preindustrial control (PIC) experiments of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The HIST and PIC also reproduce the shifts in dry and wet events probabilities, indicating potential for decadal predictability based on GCMs. Persistence of the current NSG positive phase favors above normal frequency of western Amazon dry events in coming decades.\n",

Assuming that the contrast in material strengths responsible for the terracing is the same dielectric interface that causes the radar reflection, we can combine these data to estimate the dielectric constant of the overlying material. We compare these results to a three-component dielectric mixing model to constrain composition.

The arrival of interplanetary shocks drives magnetosphere and ionosphere current systems, which then induce electric currents at ground level. The impact of these currents at high latitudes has been extensively researched, but the magnetic equator has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the potential effects of interplanetary shocks on the equatorial region and demonstrate that their magnetic signature is amplified by the equatorial electrojet. This local amplification substantially increases the region's susceptibility to GICs. Importantly, this result applies to both geomagnetic storms and quiet periods and thus represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of adverse space weather impacts on technological infrastructure.\n",

Therefore, we used an ultrawide band ground-penetrating radar in Northeast Greenland in autumn 2009 to estimate the volumetric composition inside the soil through dielectric characterization from 200 to 3200\u00a0MHz. Our results suggest a compression of the gas reservoir during the phase transition of soil water, which is accompanied by a peak in surface CH4 emissions. About 1\u00a0week thereafter, there seems to be a decompression event, consistent with ground cracking which allows the gas reservoir to expand again. This coincides with the largest CH4 emission, exceeding the summer maximum by a factor of 4. We argue that these complementary measurement techniques are needed to come to an understanding of tundra CH4 bursts connected to soil freezing.\n",

Arctic permafrost holds twice as much C as the atmosphere, thus recent warming and changes in atmospheric deposition to the region raise the need for a better understanding of how DOC is changing in arctic surface waters. In Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, lakewater DOC concentrations declined by 14 to 55% (absolute changes of 1 to 24\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121) between 2003 and 2013, without significant changes in quality. Lakewater sulfate concentrations, but not chloride or conductivity, increased. These results suggest that similar to processes that have occurred at northern midlatitudes, increases in soil ionic strength as a result of sulfate enrichment may be linked to declining surface water DOC concentrations. Such enrichment may be occurring with enhanced non-sea-salt sulfate deposition. Our results reveal that rapid changes are occurring in the carbon cycle of this region of southwest Greenland.\n",

In this study, a three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator that couples fluid flow with earthquake simulation was used to investigate a novel hypothesis for why large postinjection seismic events occur. Fractures that form dead-end pathways differentially pressurize during injection. After injection is stopped, fluid backflows through the well from the dead-end fractures into larger fractures, inducing additional seismicity and potentially causing events larger than occurred during injection.

The results show that there are two distinct classes of IC lightning events with very high peak currents: the well-known narrow bipolar events, and a previously unreported type that we call energetic in-cloud pulses (EIPs). Their temporal and spatial context shows that EIPs are generated from existing negative polarity leaders that are propagating usually upward but sometimes downward. The nearly identical characteristics of EIPs and some previously reported terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) indicate a likely connection between the two, which further suggests the possibility of downward directed TGFs. These very high peak current IC events also suggest the association of EIPs with ionospheric perturbations and optical emissions known as elves.\n",

To date, little attention has been focussed on the prediction of interannual sea level anomalies. Here we demonstrate that forecasts of coastal sea level anomalies from the dynamical Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) have significant skill throughout the equatorial Pacific and along the eastern boundaries of the Pacific and Indian Oceans at lead times out to 8\u2009months. POAMA forecasts for the western Pacific generally have greater skill than persistence, particularly at longer lead times. POAMA also has comparable or greater skill than previously published statistical forecasts from both a Markov model and canonical correlation analysis. Our results indicate the capability of physically based models to address the challenge of providing skillful forecasts of seasonal sea level fluctuations for coastal communities over a broad area and at a range of lead times.\n",

Using the typical adjustment procedure that matches the mean and standard deviation of tree ring PDSI values to those of instrumental data shows over 10 droughts from 800 to 2006 that were more severe than the 1\u2009year 2014 drought, with the 2014 drought having a return period of 140\u2013180\u2009years. Quantile mapping allows for a closer correspondence between instrumental and tree ring PDSI probability distributions and produces return periods of 700\u2013900\u2009years for the 1\u2009year 2014 drought.

Here we present a result of 4K-cooler climate experiment. The global TC frequency significantly increases in the 4K-cooler climate compared to the present climate. This is consistent with a significant decrease in TC frequency in the 4K-warmer climate. For the mechanism of TC frequency reduction in a warmer climate, upward mass flux hypothesis and saturation deficit hypothesis have been proposed. The result of the 4K-cooler climate experiment is consistent with these two hypotheses. One very interesting point is that the experiment has clearly shown that TC genesis is possible at sea surface temperature (SST) well below 26\u00b0C which has been considered as the lowest SST limit for TC genesis.\n",

A smaller role of the Kelvin mode is diagnosed over the Indian Ocean and the maritime continent.

We present the skewness index, a metric to quantify the spatial distribution of land use within watersheds. Using this index and a river network nitrogen removal model, we quantified the effect of varying the location of developed land use within two watersheds on nutrient removal and export. The quantity and location of developed land use as well as runoff affected nitrogen removal and export. Because river network nitrogen removal is bypassed when sources are skewed toward the watershed mouth, varying the location of land use alone can double aquatic nitrogen removal. Nutrient sources skewed toward the distant headwaters maximized in-stream removal which in turn can reduce watershed export.\n",

We explore the origin of the westward drift commonly seen in dynamo simulations and show that it propagates at the speed of the slow magnetic Rossby waves with respect to a mean zonal flow. Our results indicate that such waves could be excited in the Earth's core and that wave propagation may indeed play some role in the longitudinal drift, particularly at higher latitudes where the wave component is relatively strong, the equatorial westward drift being dominated by the mean flow.

The main sources of uncertainty in sea ice thickness retrievals are associated with inadequate knowledge of the snow layer depth and the radar interaction with the snow pack. Here we adapt a method of deriving sea ice freeboard from CryoSat-2 to data from the AltiKa Ka band radar altimeter over the 2013\u201314 Arctic sea ice growth season. AltiKa measures basin-averaged freeboards between 4.4\u00a0cm and 6.9\u00a0cm larger than CryoSat-2 in October and March, respectively. Using airborne laser and radar measurements from spring 2013 and 2014, we estimate the effective scattering horizon for each sensor. While CryoSat-2 echoes penetrate to the ice surface over first-year ice and penetrate the majority (82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%) of the snow layer over multiyear ice, AltiKa echoes are scattered from roughly the midpoint (46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%) of the snow layer over both ice types.\n",

These disturbances were initiated by an ionospheric source activated about 5\u20136\u2009min after the airburst. The disturbance velocity damping with time and distance from the airburst was revealed using a GPS interferometric technique. Several modes of TEC disturbances with propagation velocities ranging from 250 to 660\u2009m/s were distinguished through the distance-time diagram analysis. The estimated position of ionospheric source of TEC disturbances is shifted 36\u2009km southwestward from the airburst, which is most likely to be associated with the conjoint influence of TEC data errors, damping and anisotropy of TID propagation velocity.\n",

However, the El Ni\u00f1o that started to develop in 2014 was hindered in the boreal summer, and only the ocean reached a weak El Ni\u00f1o condition. This outcome was largely attributed to a suppressed ocean-atmosphere interaction caused by anomalous easterly winds in the eastern equatorial Pacific. These winds were related to negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the southeastern subtropical Pacific (SESP). The negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) laid the foundation for the persistence of cooler SSTAs and enhanced trade winds in the SESP after the year 2000. As the recent IPO downward trend continued, the SSTAs in SESP reached an extremely low value in the boreal summer of 2014 and imposed a serious obstacle to the evolution of a warming event.\n",

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are a major transfer of terrestrial carbon to river systems, and the fate of DOC in aquatic systems is poorly constrained. We used a unique combination of spatially distributed sampling of three DOC fractions throughout a river network and modeling to quantify the net removal of terrestrial DOC during a summer base flow period. We found that aquatic reactivity of terrestrial DOC leading to net loss is low, closer to conservative chloride than to reactive nitrogen. Net removal occurred mainly from the hydrophobic organic acid fraction, while hydrophilic and transphilic acids showed no net change, indicating that partitioning of bulk DOC into different fractions is critical for understanding terrestrial DOC removal. These findings suggest that river systems may have only a modest ability to alter the amounts of terrestrial DOC delivered to coastal zones.\n",

These deposits record a prolonged (multidecadal) interval of enhanced erosion following the initial storm-induced landscape disturbance.

The best time function for modeling the InSAR data set is a double exponential model with rates increasing from 2007 through 2010 and decreasing slowly since 2010.

Temperature dependences of hydrogen diffusion in ringwoodite were determined to be DH\u2009=\u200910\u2212\u20097.29(\u00b10.46)\u2009exp[\u2212101(\u00b110)kJ\u2002mol\u2212\u20091/RT]\u2002m2/s in ringwoodite at 21\u2009GPa. The proton conductivities of ringwoodite estimated from the present diffusion coefficients are similar to those of Yoshino et al. [2008] at the transition zone condition at low water content (<1000\u2009ppm by weight (ppmw)) but lower at higher water content range (>1000\u2009ppmw). If the proton-vacancy mechanism is assumed to be a main controlling mechanism, contribution of water to the electrical conductivity of ringwoodite is insignificant due to large contribution of hopping conduction at the transition zone condition, and global average water concentration in the lower part of transition zone is less than 1000\u2009ppmw.\n",

We construct a 3-D dynamic rupture model of an earthquake on the Pitas Point and Lower Red Mountain faults to model low-frequency ground motion and the resulting tsunami, with a goal of elucidating the seismic and tsunami hazard in this area. Our model results in an average stress drop of 6\u2009MPa, an average fault slip of 7.4\u2009m, and a moment magnitude of 7.7, consistent with regional paleoseismic data. Our corresponding tsunami model uses final seafloor displacement from the rupture model as initial conditions to compute local propagation and inundation, resulting in large peak tsunami amplitudes northward and eastward due to site and path effects. Modeled inundation in the Ventura area is significantly greater than that indicated by state of California's current reference inundation line.\n",

In these conditions, a motion of the X line has been predicted in the direction of the electron diamagnetic drift. When this motion is super Alfvenic, reconnection should be suppressed. We analysed a large data set of Double Star TC-1 dayside magnetopause crossings, which includes reconnection and nonreconnection events. Moreover, it also includes several events during which TC-1 is near the X line. With these close events, we verified the diamagnetic suppression condition with local observations near the X line. Moreover, with the same close events, we also studied the motion of the X line along the magnetopause. It is found that, when reconnection is not suppressed, the X line moves northward or southward according to the orientation of the guide field, which is related to the interplanetary magnetic field BY component, in agreement with the diamagnetic drift.\n",

Quasiperiodic emissions in the frequency range 2\u20136\u2009kHz were observed during a substorm on 25 January 2013 by Van Allen Probe-A and a ground-based station in the Northern Finland. The spacecraft detected the VLF signals near the geomagnetic equator in the night sector at L\u2009=\u20093.0\u20134.2 when it was inside the plasmasphere. During the satellite motion toward higher latitudes, the time interval between quasiperiodic elements decreased from 6\u2009min to 3\u2009min. We find one-to-one correspondence between the quasiperiodic elements detected by Van Allen Probe-A and on the ground, which indicates the temporal nature of the observed variation in the time interval between quasiperiodic elements. Multi\u0441omponent measurements of the wave electric and magnetic fields by the Van Allen Probe-A show that the quasiperiodic emissions were almost circularly right-hand polarized whistler mode waves and had predominantly small (below 30\u00b0) wave vector angles with respect to the magnetic field. In the probable source region of these signals (L about 4), we observed synchronous variations of electron distribution function at energies of 10\u201320\u2009keV and the quasiperiodic elements. In the pause between the quasiperiodic elements pitch angle distribution of these electrons had a maximum near 90\u00b0, while they become more isotropic during the development of quasiperiodic elements. The parallel energies of the electrons for which the data suggest direct evidence of the wave-particle interactions is in a reasonable agreement with the estimated cyclotron resonance energy for the observed waves.\n",

Strong electric fields and currents due to the Hall effect are set up in narrow regions where ions are demagnetized but electrons remain magnetized. It has been recently shown that cold (few eV) ions are abundant or even dominate the Earth's magnetosphere, but most of the previous reconnection studies do not account for this population. These cold ions remain magnetized down to smaller length scales than the hot ions, introducing a new scale into the system. In addition, the Hall currents are partially canceled by magnetized cold ions. We use observations by the Cluster spacecraft at the Earth's magnetopause to verify that when a mixture of ions of very different temperatures is present in reconnecting plasmas, the microphysics related to the Hall effect is significantly modified.\n",

What is crucial for electron enhancements at geosynchronous orbit are sustained south-oriented or north-south fluctuating interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz that drives sufficiently large substorm activity and small solar wind density Nsw that likely leads to low loss rate of relativistic electrons to the ionosphere and/or to the magnetopause for an extended time period. Specifically, almost all the abrupt, large electron increases in our data set took place under the condition of average AE\u2009>\u2009235\u2009nT and average Nsw\u2009\u2264\u20095\u2009cm\u22123.

Using this technique, we mapped the amplitude of the radial, meridional, and zonal components and of total intensity of the ionospheric current density at the satellite's altitudes, i.e., the F region of the ionosphere, during two local nighttime intervals: before and after midnight. Most of the obtained results are consistent with some of the known features of nighttime F region currents; others need further investigation. The proposed technique could contribute in selecting magnetic data with minimum contamination from nighttime F region electric currents for magnetic modeling purposes.\n",

An intriguing question is whether such MeVelectron injections can populate the outer radiation belt. Here we present observations of a substorm injection of MeV electrons into the inner magnetosphere. In the premidnight sector at L \u223c 5.5, Van Allen Probes (Radiation Belt Storm Probes)-A observed a large dipolarization electric field (50\u00a0mV/m) over \u223c40\u00a0s and a dispersionless injection of electrons up to \u223c3\u00a0MeV. Pitch angle observations indicated betatron acceleration of MeV electrons at the dipolarization front. Corresponding signals of MeV electron injection were observed at LANL-GEO, THEMIS-D, and GOES at geosynchronous altitude. Through a series of dipolarizations, the injections increased the MeV electron phase space density by 1 order of magnitude in less than 3\u00a0h in the outer radiation belt (L > 4.8). Our observations provide evidence that deep injections can supply significant MeV electrons.\n",

Residuals are analyzed between the data and empirical Global Average Mass Density Model (GAMDM) that takes into account density variability due to solar activity, season, geomagnetic activity, and long-term trend. A superposed epoch analysis of 37 SSW events reveals a density reduction of 3\u20137% at 250\u2013575\u00a0km around the time of maximum polar vortex weakening. The relative density perturbation is found to be greater at higher altitudes. The temperature perturbation is estimated to be \u22127.0\u00a0K at 400\u00a0km.

It has been revealed that the By fluctuations accompanying substorm dipolarizations are consistent with pulses of field-aligned currents near the high-latitude edge of the plasma sheet. Detailed analysis of the By fluctuations reveals that they are near circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, most likely Alfv\u00e9n waves. Soon afterward the plasma sheet thickened and MESSENGER detected a series of compressional waves. These Alfv\u00e9nic and compressional waves have similar durations (10\u201320\u2009s), suggesting that they may arise from the same source. Drawing on Pi2 pulsation models developed for Earth, we suggest that the Alfv\u00e9nic and compressional waves reported here at Mercury may be generated by the quasi-periodic sunward flow bursts in Mercury's plasma sheet. But because they are observed during the period with rapid magnetic field reconfiguration, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of standing Alfv\u00e9n wave.\n",

Electrons can rapidly gain energy from the waves when they resonate via a process called drift resonance, which is observationally characterized by energy-dependent phase differences between electron flux and electromagnetic oscillations. Such dependence has been recently observed and interpreted as spacecraft identifications of drift resonance electron acceleration. Here we show that in the initial wave cycles, the observed phase relationship differs from that characteristic of well-developed drift resonance. We further examine the differences and find that they are imprints of impulse-excited, coupled fast-Alfv\u00e9n waves before they transform into more typical standing waves. Our identification of such imprints provides a new understanding of how energy couples in the inner magnetosphere, and a new diagnostic for the generation and growth of magnetospheric hydromagnetic pulsations.\n",

Using general circulation model simulations of Titan's atmosphere, we show that atmospheric moisture transport by three-dimensional tropospheric eddies is critical in generating Titan's surface liquid asymmetry. Comparison of axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations demonstrates that a significant asymmetry only develops in the latter case. Analysis of the components of the three-dimensional moisture transport reveals that nonaxisymmetric eddies transport methane away from the poles and into the midlatitudes, where they transfer moisture into the cross-equatorial transport by the mean meridional circulation, producing an atmospheric \u201cbucket brigade.\u201d Because these high-latitude, baroclinic eddies are more intense in the south than in the north, the net transport is preferentially northward, with the northern hemisphere gaining surface liquid at the expense of the southern hemisphere.\n",

Covering the preproduction and coproduction periods from 1981 to 2013, we analyze interevent times, spatial dimension, and frequency-size distributions for natural and induced earthquakes. Individually, these distributions are statistically indistinguishable. Determining the distribution of nearest neighbor distances in a combined space-time-magnitude metric, lets us identify clear differences between both kinds of seismicity. Compared to natural earthquakes, induced earthquakes feature a larger population of background seismicity and nearest neighbors at large magnitude rescaled times and small magnitude rescaled distances. Local stress perturbations induced by field operations appear to be strong enough to drive local faults through several seismic cycles and reactivate them after time periods on the order of a year.\n",

Our model showed that the dynamic rupture front propagated eastward from the hypocenter at 3.0\u2009km/s and triggered a large-slip event centered about 50\u2009km to the east. It also showed that the large-slip event included a rapid rupture acceleration event and an irregular deceleration of rupture propagation before the rupture termination. Heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy in the eastern part of the rupture area, where aftershock activity was high, inhibited rupture growth. High-frequency radiation sources tended to be in the deeper part of the large-slip area, which suggests that heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy there may have contributed to the damage in and around Kathmandu.\n",

We find a constant local ratio of vertical to horizontal slip through multiple past earthquakes, suggesting the kinematic style of the Hoshab fault has remained constant throughout the late Quaternary. We also find evidence for active faulting on a series of nearby, subparallel faults, showing that failure in large, distributed and rare earthquakes is the likely method of faulting across the eastern Makran, reconciling geodetic and long-term records of strain accumulation.\n",

We monitored the evolution of the eruption and collected samples for laboratory characterization of physicochemical and rheological properties. Over time, muds show a progressive dilution with water; the rheology is typical of pseudoplastic fluids, with a small yield stress that decreases as mud density decreases. The eruption, while not naturally triggered, shares several similarities with natural mud volcanoes, including mud componentry, grain-size distribution, gas discharge, and mud rheology. We use the size of large ballistic fragments ejected from the vent along with mud rheology to compute a minimum ascent velocity of the mud. Computed values are consistent with in situ measurements of gas phase velocities, confirming that the stratigraphic record of mud eruptions can be quantitatively used to infer eruption history and ascent rates and hence to assess (or reassess) mud eruption hazards.\n",

The ejection velocity of pyroclasts decreases over time and defines a conical profile centered on the jet central streamline.

These patterns include constant, decreasing, or abruptly increasing decelerations up to 104\u2009m\u2009s\u22122. Nonuniform deceleration focuses at the jet sides and, mostly, in a narrow zone across the vortex ring.

Our results are consistent with a microstructural state-variable description of dislocation-effected deformation whose rate is accelerated by grain boundary sliding. The fine-grained specimens reveal no subgrain boundaries, indicating that the stress-sensitive microstructural feature upon which the state-variable behavior is founded may be the dislocation structure of the grain boundaries. Deviations of our constant-hardness data from the behavior predicted by the state-variable formulation allow estimation of the viscosity of the grain boundaries, which is ~4.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009Pa\u2009s at this temperature.\n",

The earthquake's location within a regional network has allowed us to study it in rich detail. Double-difference relocations of aftershocks and static stress modeling reveal some intriguing features; most aftershocks are not located on the main shock rupture plane, but are concentrated in the adjacent Wadati-Benioff zone in areas of increased stress. Further, a secondary plane of seismicity aligns well with a moderately dipping nodal plane reported by the Global Centroid Moment Tensor Project, and the separation of these locations and the main shock hypocenter from the slab indicates that the main shock ruptured into the oceanic mantle.\n",

The current 3-D distribution of grain size in the mantle is, however, unknown. To explore the possible variability of grain size, we use the following: geodynamic inferences of effective viscosity, vacancy diffusion rates in upper mantle minerals and perovskite in the lower mantle, lateral variations in temperature derived from seismic images, and different geotherms. An important outcome of this modeling is a new mapping of lateral viscosity variations throughout the mantle. The corresponding 3-D variations in grain size are characterized by 2 orders of magnitude changes. We find a correlation between grain size variability in the mantle and absolute viscosity changes with depth. Our findings suggest that the traditional assumption of Arrhenius temperature dependence for vacancy diffusion in the lower mantle is not sufficient to constrain the deformation mechanisms that determine its effective bulk viscosity.\n",

We propose a simplified method to obtain thermal properties from single-sided TPS signatures. Results reveal that both volume fraction and distribution of the pore constituents govern the thermal conductivity of unsaturated specimens. Thermal conductivity hysteresis is observed due to water redistribution and fabric change caused by hydrate formation and dissociation. Measured thermal conductivity increases evidently when hydrate saturation Sh\u2009>\u200930\u201340%, shifting upward from the geometric mean model prediction to a Pythagorean mixing model.

Poor signal-to-noise ratio due to anthropogenic activity is mitigated via downward-continuation of the recorded wavefield. The downward-continued data are continuously back projected to search for coherent arrivals from sources beneath the array, which reveals numerous, previously undetected events. The spatial distribution of seismicity is uncorrelated with the mapped fault traces, or with activity in the nearby oil-fields. Many events are located at depths larger than 20 km, well below the commonly accepted seismogenic depth for that area. The seismicity exhibits temporal clustering consistent with Omori's law, and its size distribution obeys the Gutenberg-Richter relation above 20\u00a0km but falls off exponentially at larger depths. The dense array allows detection of earthquakes two magnitude units smaller than the permanent seismic network in the area. Because the event size distribution above 20\u00a0km depth obeys a power law whose exponent is near one, this improvement yields a hundred-fold decrease in the time needed for effective characterization of seismicity in Long Beach.\n",

Array processing using cross-correlation lag times and semblance places constraints on the lahar's dynamics, including detection of an initial flow pulse that traveled from 2 to 12\u2009km at an average speed of 38\u2009m/s. Subsequently, the lahar signal evolved to a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located 10 to 12\u2009km from the vent and adjacent to a topographic notch, through which sound may have preferentially diffracted toward the recording site.

However, seismic velocities are strongly influenced by rainfall and subsequent pore pressure perturbations. Here we increase the detection of precursory seismic velocity changes to an eruption by removing the effects of pore pressure changes. During 2011\u20132013, the volcano exhibits a low eruptive activity during which we observe seismic velocity variations well correlated with rainfall episodes. We estimated the transfer function between fluid pressure and seismic velocity changes. We use these results to correct seismic velocity change time series for pore pressure changes, due to rainfall and found a preeruptive velocity drop (0.15%) associated with the 21 June 2014 eruption that was undetected before correction.\n",

The first microscopic observation of fluid flow and solute transport through a rough-walled fracture was made to assess the evolution of eddies and their effect on non-Fickian tailing. A noteworthy phenomenon was observed that as the eddy grew, the particles were initially caught in and swirled around within eddies, and then cast back into main flow channel, which reduced tailing. This differs from the conventional conceptual model, which presumes a distinct separation between mobile and immobile zones. Fluid flow and solute transport modeling within the 3-D fracture confirmed tail shortening due to mass transfer by advective paths between the eddies and the main flow channel, as opposed to previous 2-D numerical studies that showed increased tailing with growing eddies.\n",

Flow alteration varies inversely with watershed area and, for larger streams, is compounded by upstream withdrawals. The ratio of daily permitted withdrawal to median stream flow ranges from 0.0001 to unity, although low flows in most, but not all, smaller streams are protected by pass-by flow requirements. Temporal changes in surface water withdrawals track gas well completion activity, rather than changes in operational strategies, and while reuse of wastewater has increased since 2009, freshwater accounted for 75% of water used in hydraulic fracturing through the peak in gas well completion activity.\n",

The dense fluid mixture, which is generated at the fluid-fluid interface, leads to the onset of a convective fingering instability and triggers a fast chemical dissolution reaction. Contrary to intuition, the dissolution pattern does not map out the finger geometry. Instead, it displays a dome-like, hierarchical structure that follows the path of the ascending fluid interface and the regions of maximum mixing. These mixing and reaction hot spots coincide with the flow stagnation points, at which the interfacial mixing layer is compressed and deformed. We show that the deformation of the boundary layer around the stagnation points controls the evolution of the global scalar dissipation and reaction rates and shapes the structure of the reacted zones. The persistent compression of the mixing layer explains the independence of the mixing rate from the Rayleigh number when convection dominates.\n",

We adapt a model from fluvial seismology to explain this observation and then invert it to estimate the level of bed sediment (and rate of entrainment) beneath a passing series of surges. Our estimates compare favorably with previous direct measurements of entrainment rates at the site, suggesting the approach may be a new indirect way to obtain rare field constraints needed to test models of debris flow entrainment.\n",

The simplicity of this approach enables assimilation of meltwater runoff into coupled climate models, which is demonstrated here in a case study with the medium-resolution (1\u00b0) Community Earth System Model. The model results suggest that the decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is dominated by warming of the surface ocean and enhanced GrIS freshwater forcing leads to a slightly enhanced (\u22121.2\u00a0sverdrup in the 21st century) weakening of the AMOC.\n",

The heat content of the NSTM layer was anomalously large following summer 2007, which saw considerable sea ice losses and intense solar absorption into the exposed surface ocean. Measurements provide evidence for the entrainment of NSTM layer heat in fall/winter 2007\u20132008 by shear-driven mixing, and convective mixing by the release of dense, salty plumes during sea ice growth. While at least a portion of the NSTM layer was eroded, deeper warm ocean layers remained unaffected.

The results presented herein suggest that coasts fronted by relatively narrow reefs with steep fore reef slopes (~1:10 and steeper) and deeper, smoother reef flats are expected to experience the highest wave runup. Wave runup increases for higher water levels (sea level rise), higher waves, and lower bed roughness (coral degradation), which are all expected effects of climate change.

Despite their importance, pathways of anthropogenic carbon subduction are poorly understood. Here we use an ocean carbon cycle model to quantify the mechanisms controlling this subduction. Over the last decade, 90% of the oceanic anthropogenic carbon is subducted at the base of the seasonally varying mixed layer. Vertical diffusion is the primary mechanism of this subduction (contributing 65% of total subduction), despite very low local fluxes. In contrast, advection drives the spatial patterns of subduction, with high positive and negative local fluxes.

We examine this hypothesis using an ensemble of coupled, ocean-atmosphere models and find limited evidence for intensification of upwelling-favorable winds or atmospheric pressure gradients in response to increasing land-sea temperature differences. However, our analyses reveal consistent latitudinal and seasonal dependencies of projected changes in wind intensity associated with poleward migration of major atmospheric high-pressure cells. Summertime winds near poleward boundaries of climatological upwelling zones are projected to intensify, while winds near equatorward boundaries are projected to weaken.

        "description": "\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos is a flourishing yet fragile ecosystem whose health is particularly sensitive to regional and global climate variations. The distribution of several species, including the Gal\u00e1pagos Penguin, is intimately tied to upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water along the western shores of the archipelago. Here we show, using reliable, high-resolution sea surface temperature observations, that the Gal\u00e1pagos cold pool has been intensifying and expanding northward since 1982. The linear cooling trend of 0.8\u00b0C/33\u2009yr is likely the result of long-term changes in equatorial ocean circulation previously identified. Moreover, the northward expansion of the cold pool is dynamically consistent with a slackening of the cross-equatorial component of the regional trade winds\u2014leading to an equatorward shift of the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent. The implied change in strength and distribution of upwelling has important implications for ongoing and future conservation measures in the Gal\u00e1pagos.\n",

The vertical extent of the water mass anomalies in the warm (cold) STE is about 190\u2009m (150\u2009m), and its horizontal length scale is 22\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009km (18\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009km). According to their water mass properties, we speculate that the warm and cold STEs are generated in the North Pacific Subtropical and Subarctic Front region, respectively. The observed STEs may play an important role in modifying the intermediate-layer water properties in the STNWP, and this needs to be confirmed by more focused observations in the future.\n",

Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.\n",

Our analysis shows that the greenhouse gas forcing alone results in a significant forecast skill on the 2\u20135 and 6\u20139\u00a0year range even for uninitialized hindcasts. For the first forecast year, the forecast skill of Modini is generally comparable with previous initialization procedures applied to MPI-ESM.

Modini is also better able to capture the observed hiatus in global warming in hindcast mode than the other methods.

Years with anomalously high tropical North Atlantic SSTs during March\u2013June were often followed by a more active hurricane season and a larger number of satellite-detected fires in the southern Amazon during June\u2013November. The relationship between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and southern Amazon fires (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.003) was stronger than links between SSTs and either cyclones or fires alone, suggesting that fires and tropical cyclones were directly coupled to the same underlying atmospheric dynamics governing tropical moisture redistribution. These relationships help explain why seasonal outlook forecasts for hurricanes and Amazon fires both failed in 2013 and may enable the design of improved early warning systems for drought and fire in Amazon forests.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe spatial and temporal variability of the recent land warming hiatus have seldom been explored, despite their importance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. In this study, we applied piecewise linear regression to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the breakpoint time of warming over 40\u2009years (1974\u20132013). Our results showed that at the global scale, mean annual temperature (MAT) over the land increased significantly until 2005 and that the warming trend then stalled. However, the breakpoint time of the warming varied greatly among different seasons and continents. We found no statistically significant breakpoint in MAT over the Northern Hemisphere, but MAT over the Southern Hemisphere showed a significant breakpoint (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in 1979. At the seasonal scale, only the winter season (December-January-February) showed a statistically significant breakpoint in global land temperature. The other seasons showed continuous increasing temperature during the whole study period. Our study examined the recent global warming hiatus on the land surface using an area-weighted summary of a scale-dependent phenomenon with substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity and revealed the winter cooling in the Northern Hemisphere low-middle latitudes in 1999\u20132008 as the major contributor to the global warming hiatus on land surface in 2005. This result highlights the importance of using a statistical method to identify the timing of climate phase change. A better understanding of the processes behind the spatiotemporal patterns of local-scale breakpoint occurrences in land surface temperature would shed new light on the mechanisms of the recent global warming hiatus.\n",

Here I will show how trends in warm and cold extremes have evolved over the last six decades in Europe on local scales. Comparing the slopes of two extreme quantiles demonstrates that there are significant disparities in trends of cold and warm temperature extremes at many locations in Europe. At some locations the range of extreme cold and hot temperatures increases, while at other locations it decreases. These results suggest that at some locations both warm and cold extremes intensify which seems to be contradictory to the prevailing view of global warming in which both cold and warm temperatures are expected to increase.\n",

However, no study has quantified the temporal dynamics of aerosol-cloud interactions with direct observations. Here for the first time, we use temporally offset satellite observations from northern Africa between 2006 and 2010 to quantitatively measure the effect of fire aerosols on convective cloud dynamics. We attribute a reduction in cloud fraction during periods of high aerosol optical depths to a smoke-driven inhibition of convection. We find that higher smoke burdens limit upward vertical motion, increase surface pressure, and increase low-level divergence\u2014meteorological indicators of convective suppression. These results are corroborated by climate simulations that show a smoke-driven increase in regionally averaged shortwave tropospheric heating and decrease in convective precipitation during the fire season. Our results suggest that in tropical regions, anthropogenic fire initiates a positive feedback loop where increased aerosol emissions limit convection, dry the surface, and enable increased fire activity via human ignition.\n",

Like precipitation rate, precipitation frequency is dominated by warm rain, defined as rain produced via the liquid phase only, over the tropical oceans outside the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by cold rain, produced via the ice phase, over the midlatitude oceans and continents. Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.\n",

Ensemble spread profiles indicate a yearly mean effective sound speed variation of up to 8 ms\u22121 in the stratosphere, exceeding occasionally 25 ms\u22121 for a single ensemble set. It is shown that errors in point estimates of effective sound speed are dominated by variations in wind strength and direction. One year of large mining explosions in the Aitik mine, northern Sweden, observed at infrasound array IS37 in northern Norway are simulated using 3-D ray tracing.

Here we show that the relative concentrations of metal atoms in the upper mesosphere, and the surface accretion rate of cosmic spherules, provide sensitive probes of this distribution. Three cosmic dust models are selected as case studies: two are astronomical models, the first constrained by infrared observations of the Zodiacal Dust Cloud and the second by radar observations of meteor head echoes; the third model is based on measurements made with a spaceborne dust detector. For each model, a Monte Carlo sampling method combined with a chemical ablation model is used to predict the ablation rates of Na, K, Fe, Mg, and Ca above 60\u2009km and cosmic spherule production rate. It appears that a significant fraction of the cosmic dust consists of small (<5\u2009\u00b5g) and slow (<15\u2009km\u2009s\u22121) particles.\n",

While the Earth system continues to accumulate energy due to anthropogenic and other radiative forcings, estimates of recent surface temperature evolution fall at the lower end of climate model projections. Global mean temperatures from climate model simulations are typically calculated using surface air temperatures, while the corresponding observations are based on a blend of air and sea surface temperatures. This work quantifies a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. A further bias arises from the treatment of temperatures in regions where the sea ice boundary has changed. Applying the methodology of the HadCRUT4 record to climate model temperature fields accounts for 38% of the discrepancy in trend between models and observations over the period 1975\u20132014.\n",
