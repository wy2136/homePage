        "description": "\n\nA significant fraction of the energy released by magnetotail reconnection appears to go into ion heating, but this heating is generally anisotropic. We examine ARTEMIS dual-spacecraft observations of a long-duration magnetotail exhaust generated by anti-parallel reconnection in conjunction with Particle-In-Cell simulations, showing spatial variations in the anisotropy across the outflow far (> 100di) downstream of the X-line. A consistent pattern is found in both the spacecraft data and the simulations: Whilst the total temperature across the exhaust is rather constant, near the boundaries Ti,|| dominates. The plasma is well-above the firehose threshold within patchy spatial regions at |BX|\u2009\u2208\u2009[0.1,\u20090.5]B0, suggesting that the drive for the instability is strong and the instability is too weak to relax the anisotropy. At the mid-plane (|BX|0.1\u2009B0), Ti,\u22a5\u2009>\u2009Ti,|| and ions undergo Speiser-like motion despite the large distance from the X-line.\n",

We use a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and place a dipole magnetic field at the center of the Moon to mimic the induced magnetic field, which is the response of the lunar interior to the time-varying interplanetary magnetic field. Consistent with previous observations and theoretical predictions, we show that the induced magnetic fields on the dayside are confined within the lunar surface through a dayside current sheet. In contrast to previous work, we show that the induced magnetic fields are not confined in the lunar wake, and they leak out, sometimes even appearing as lunar limb compressions. Finally, we identify favorable places to observe induced magnetic fields by electromagnetic sounding techniques, which will help to better constrain the lunar electrical conductivity profile, and interior structure.\n",

        "description": "\n\nBifurcating rivers shape natural landscapes by distributing water and sediments on fluvial plains and in deltas. Symmetrical bifurcations were often found to be unstable so that one branch downstream of the bifurcation enlarged whilst the other dwindled. A unified theory able to predict bifurcation stability in both gravel- and sand-bed rivers is still lacking. Here we develop a new theory for the stability of bifurcations for the entire range of gravel- to sand-bed rivers. The theory indicates opposite behavior of gravel- and sand-bed rivers: we predict that symmetrical bifurcations are inherently stable for intermediate Shields stresses, but are inherently unstable for the low and high Shields stresses found in the majority of rivers on Earth. In the latter conditions asymmetrical bifurcations are stable. These predictions are corroborated by observations and have ramifications for many environmental problems in fluvio-deltaic settings.\n",

Initial data from three stations 100 km from the RIS front and within 10 km of each other show both dispersed infragravity (IG) wave and ocean swell-generated signals resulting from waves that originate in the North Pacific. Spectral levels from 0.001\u201310 Hz have the highest accelerations in the IG band (0.0025\u20130.03 Hz). Polarization analyses indicate complex frequency-dependent particle motions, with energy in several frequency bands having distinctly different propagation characteristics. The dominant IG band signals exhibit predominantly horizontal propagation from the north. Particle motion analyses indicate retrograde elliptical particle motions, in the IG band, consistent with these signals propagating as Rayleigh-Lamb (flexural) waves in the ice shelf/water cavity system that are excited by ocean wave interactions nearer the shelf front.\n",

The extratropical oceans are thought to exert noticeable feedbacks on the atmosphere especially on decadal and longer time scales, yet the large-scale atmospheric response to anomalous extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) is still under debate. Here we show, by means of dedicated high-resolution atmospheric model experiments, that sufficient daily variability in the extratropical background SST needs to be resolved to force a statistically significant large-scale atmospheric response to decadal North Pacific SST anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which is consistent with observations. The large-scale response is mediated by atmospheric eddies. This implies that daily extratropical SST fluctuations must be simulated by the ocean components and resolved by the atmospheric components of global climate models to enable realistic simulation of decadal North Pacific sector climate variability.\n",

We have identified several TGF-associated lightning radio emissions in which the altitudes of in-cloud lightning leader pulses that precede and follow the TGF can be measured. We combine these with high-absolute-timing accuracy TGF observations from the Fermi satellite to determine the development of the lightning channel before, during, and after the TGF production. All of these TGFs were produced several milliseconds after the leader had initiated and when the leaders reached 1\u20132 km in length. After the TGFs, the leaders all continued to ascend forseveral more km with no dramatic change in their characteristics, although they all exhibited high average velocities of 0.8\u20131.0\u00d7106 m/s. Implications in the context of TGF models are discussed. These results paint the first clear picture of the lightning processes that occur before, during, and after TGF production.\n",

The overlap statistics of cumuli as produced by large-eddy simulations (LES) are confronted with CloudNet datasets at the J\u00fclich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE). The CloudNet pixel is small enough to detect cumuliform cloud overlap. Cloud fraction masks are derived for five different cases, using gridded time-height datasets at various temporal and vertical resolutions. The overlap ratio (R), i.e. the ratio between cloud fraction by volume and by area, is studied as a function of the vertical resolution. Good agreement is found between R derived from observations and simulations. An inverse linear function is found to best describe the observed overlap behavior, confirming previous LES results. Simulated and observed decorrelation lengths are smaller (~300 m) than previously reported (> 1km). A similar diurnal variation in the overlap efficiency is found in observations and simulations.\n",

In particular, fluid distribution in subduction zones influences earthquake occurrence, and it varies among subduction zones due to variations in fluid sources such as hydrated oceanic plates. However, the relationship between variations in fluid distribution and variations in seismicity among subduction zones is unclear. Here, we divide Earth's subduction zones into 111 regions and estimate background seismicity rates using the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. We demonstrate that background seismicity rate correlates to the amount of bending of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the hydration of oceanic plates via slab-bending-related faults. Regions with large bending may have high seismicity rates because a strongly hydrated oceanic plate causes high pore-fluid pressure and reduces the strength of the plate interface. We suggest that variations in fluid distribution can also cause variations in seismicity in subduction zones.\n",

In the North Pacific, contrasting anomalies were also present, with a straight zonal Pacific jet in 2010 and a strong poleward deviation of the Pacific jet in its exit region in 2014. Using reanalysis datasets and adopting a nonlinear initial-value approach with a quasi-geostrophic model, we show that the Pacific-North American anomalies are responsible for shaping synoptic wave trains propagating across North America. This in turn largely determines the nature of wave breaking and the synoptic eddy feedback onto the mean flow in the North Atlantic and finally the NAO phase. In such a proposed mechanism, synoptic wave activity forms the cornerstone of the dynamical relationship between the North Pacific and North Atlantic large-scale anomalies during the contrasting winters of 2010 and 2014.\n",

Of 60 such events from 1900 to present, 42 have occurred in the middle half of each year. The seasonality appears strongest in the northwest Pacific subduction zones, and weakest in the Tonga region. Taken at face value, the surplus of summer events is statistically significant, but due to the ex post facto hypothesis testing, the absence of seasonality in smaller deep earthquakes, and the lack of a known physical triggering mechanism, we cannot rule out that the observed seasonality is just random chance. However, we can make a testable prediction of seasonality in future large deep-focus earthquakes, which, given likely earthquake occurrence rates, should be verified or falsified within a few decades. If confirmed, deep earthquake seasonality would challenge our current understanding of deep earthquakes.\n",

Only dust particles aggregated with sea salt showed significant hygroscopic growth above 75% RH, resulting in a decrease in extinction mass efficiency by up to a factor 2.2. All other dust particles did not take up significant amounts of water when exposed to up to 94% RH.

These particles are interpreted as clusters of molecules, most likely water, which we refer to as nanograins because their inferred diameters are less than one hundred nm. Acceleration of the grains away from the comet is through gas drag by the expanding cometary atmosphere while acceleration back to the vicinity of the comet is caused partly by solar radiation pressure but mainly by the solar-wind electric field.

However, the entrainment velocity can deviate from the evaporative-cooling trend and even become insensitive to variations in the inversion properties. Here, the efficiency of evaporative cooling at amplifying the entrainment velocity is quantified by means of direct numerical simulations of a cloud-top mixing layer. We demonstrate that variations in the efficiency modulate the effect of evaporative cooling on entrainment, explaining the different trends. These variations are associated with the evaporation of droplets in cloud holes bellow the inversion point. The parametrization of the efficiency provides the evaporative amplification of the entrainment velocity as a function of a single parameter that characterizes the inversion. The resulting entrainment velocities match our experiments and previous measurements to within \u00b125%.

Here we probe lowermost mantle anisotropy near the Perm Anomaly using the differential splitting of SKS and SKKS phases measured at stations in Europe. We find evidence for lowermost mantle anisotropy in the vicinity of the Perm Anomaly, with geographic trends hinting at lateral variations in anisotropy across the boundaries of the Perm Anomaly as well as across a previously unsampled portion of the African LLSVP border. Our observations suggest that deformation is concentrated at the boundaries of both the Perm Anomaly and the African LLSVP.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOne of the major challenges pertaining to extreme geomagnetic storms is to understand the basic processes associated with the development of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere currents, which generate large induced surface geoelectric fields. Previous studies point out the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements during extreme storms. We examined induced global geoelectric fields derived from ground-based magnetometer recordings for 12 extreme geomagnetic storms between the years 1982\u20132005. For the present study two important extreme storms, October 29, 2003 and March 13, 1989, are shown. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide further evidence on the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements, and to show that the structure of the geoelectric field during these localized extremes at single sites can differ greatly from globally and regionally averaged fields. Although the physical processes that govern the development of these localized extremes are still not clear, we discuss some possible causes.\n",

In particular, a reconstructed \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a-like\u201d pattern during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) has been widely tied to medieval droughts in southwest North America. This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model (GCM) simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Ni\u00f1a-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) ensemble. Our results caution against drawing dynamical interpretations from a single CFR, and affirm the importance of developing CFRs through improved statistical methodology and community-driven proxy syntheses.\n",

The most notable variability associated with the AO/NAO was a northeast/southwest dipole feature across western Eurasia. More ROS events were found for northeastern Europe for the positive phase of the AO/NAO due to the increased frequency of rainfall.

Roots show an extraordinary architectural complexity that recalls their remarkable ability to adapt to environmental heterogeneity, resources availability, and climate. In fluvial environments, phreatophytes and hydrophytes cope with flow and sediment processes, and hydro- and areotropism are the main drivers for root growth. In this work, we show how the vertical root density distribution in riparian plants is the result of how plants respond to the random fluctuations of river flows. A root dataset from field and controlled outdoor experiments is used in combination with a physically-based analytical model to demonstrate that the root vertical density distribution can be ascribed to the interplay of randomness and determinism in a simple mathematical form. The shape of the distribution reflects the profitability of plant roots to grow in different soil layers depending on the soil moisture availability. For the first time, this model helps understanding in an analytical manner the adaptation strategy of plant roots to different scenarios, paving the way for the comprehension of the effects of future changes in climate and environmental conditions.\n",

We now have data that enable us to resolve a significant dawn-dusk asymmetry and find that the magnetosphere extends further from the planet on the dawn side of the planet by 7\u00b11%. In addition, an opposing dawn-dusk asymmetry in the suprathermal plasma pressure adjacent to the magnetopause has been observed. This probably acts to reduce the size asymmetry and may explain the discrepancy between the degree of asymmetry found here and a similar asymmetry found by [12] using MHD simulations. Finally, these observations sample a wide range of season, allowing the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 polar flattening (14\u00b11%) caused by the magnetodisc to be separated from the seasonally induced north-south asymmetry in the magnetopause shape found theoretically (5\u00b11% when the planet's magnetic dipole is tilted away from the Sun by 10-17\u00b0).\n",

Although HCFC-31 has never been produced in large amounts, observed mole fractions in the Northern Hemisphere increased from 2000 onward, reaching 170 ppq (parts per quadrillion, 10\u201315) in 2011-2012 before decreasing rapidly. By combining our observations with a two-dimensional atmospheric chemistry-transport model, we infer an increase in global emissions from 240 t yr\u20131 in 2000 to 840 t yr\u20131 in 2011-2012, followed by a relatively fast decline to 570 t yr\u20131 in 2014. Emissions of HCFC-31 originate most probably from intermediate product release during the manufacturing process of HFC-32 (CH2F2). The rapid decline in recent years could be due to changes in production methods rather than declines in diffusive sources such as landfills or HCFC-31 contaminations in merchandised HFC-32.\n",

Field excitation was monitored by the reference measurements in the near zone of the transmitter, which are free of the ionospheric influence. It is found that the amplitude of the field at the remote points varied depending on the solar illumination and solar elevation angle. We suppose that this effect was probably caused by the increase in the effective height of the ionospheric D-layer, just as it was previously observed in VLF. The obtained results demonstrate the response of the propagating extremely low frequency (ELF, 3\u2013300 Hz) wave to the change in the ionospheric boundary.

Abruptly slipping regions propagate along the fault at nearly the shear wave speed. We propose that the dramatic reduction in frictional strength implied by this pulse-like rupture behavior has a common mechanism to the weakening reported in high velocity friction experiments performed on rotary machines. The slip pulses can also be identified as migrating sources of high frequency seismic waves. As observations from large earthquakes show similar propagating high frequency sources, the pulses described here may have relevance to the mechanics of larger earthquakes.\n",

Based on plate reconstruction and recent ocean drilling within the Izu-Bonin-Mariana, we advance a new geodynamic model of subduction initiation (SI). We argue that the close juxtaposition of the nascent plate boundary with relic oceanic arcs is a key factor localizing initiation of this new subduction zone. The combination of thermal and compositional density contrasts between the overriding relic arc and the adjacent old Pacific oceanic plate promoted spontaneous SI. We suggest that thermal rejuvenation of the overriding plate just before 50 Ma causes a reduction in overriding plate strength and an increase in the age contrast (hence buoyancy) between the two plates, leading to SI. The computational models map out a framework in which rejuvenated relic arcs are a favorable tectonic environment for promoting subduction initiation, while transform faults and passive margins are not.\n",

The timing of the excess emission is consistent with a major dust release episode \u2272 20 kyr ago, possibly due to Encke progenitor breakup [Clube and Napier, 1984; Jenniskens, 2007].

        "description": "\n\nComplex magnetic topologies are ubiquitous in astrophysical plasmas. Analyzing magnetic nulls, regions of vanishing magnetic field, is one way to characterize 3D magnetic topologies. Magnetic nulls are believed to be important in 3D reconnection and turbulence. In the vicinity of a null, plasma particles become unmagnetized and can be accelerated to high energies by electric fields. We present the first statistical study of the occurrence of magnetic nulls and their types in the Earth's nightside magnetosphere. We are able to identify the nulls both in the tail and in the magnetopause current sheets. On average we find one null for every few current sheet crossings. We show that the type-identification of magnetic nulls may be sensitive to local fluctuations in the magnetic field. We develop and demonstrate a method to estimate the reliability of the magnetic null type-identification.\n",

The swarm migrates westward nearly horizontally over 10 km at an average velocity of 50 m/day with a diffusivity of 0.5 m2\u2219s\u22121. It successively activates the Aigion fault, a relay zone in its hanging wall, and the Fassouleika fault.

The largest internal diffusivities appear at the core of the layer defined by the clusters.

The average dissipation rate within the dye cloud is computed and combined with the diffusivity estimate to yield an overall mixing efficiency of 0.15.

We explore the effects of geoengineering on one source of climate system uncertainty by evaluating the inter-model-spread across 12 climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison project (GeoMIP). The model-spread in simulations of climate change and the model-spread in the response to solar geoengineering are not additive but rather partially cancel. That is, the model-spread in regional temperature and precipitation changes is reduced with CO2 and a solar reduction, in comparison to the case with increased CO2 alone. Furthermore, differences between models in their efficacy (the relative global mean temperature effect of solar versus CO2 radiative forcing) explain most of the regional differences between models in their response to an increased CO2 concentration that is offset by a solar reduction. These conclusions are important for clarifying geoengineering risks regarding uncertainty.\n",

Often slow ESWs are observed, suggesting generation by the Buneman instability. The instability criteria, however, are generally not satisfied. We show how slow electron holes can be generated by a modified Buneman instability in a plasma that includes a slow electron beam on top of a warm thermal electron background. This lowers the required current for marginal instability and allows for generation of slow electron holes for a wide range of beam parameters that covers expected plasma distributions in space, for example in magnetic reconnection regions. At higher beam speeds, the electron-electron beam instability becomes dominant instead, producing faster electron holes. The range of phase speeds for this model is consistent with a statistical set of observations at the magnetopause made by Cluster.\n",

These features occur within the shallow (~20 m depth) pycnocline separating cold, dilute, surface meltwater from near-freezing, salty, winter-formed waters beneath the pycnocline. An idealized numerical model suggests that the features arise from eddies and meanders generated by instability of the surface front separating meltwater from Bering Sea Water. Warm Bering Sea Water is transported across the front and into the pycnocline by the cross-frontal velocities associated with the instabilities. The accompanying lateral eddy heat fluxes may be important both in summer for promoting ice melt and in fall by delaying the onset of ice formation over portions of this shelf. Lateral heat flux magnitudes depend upon the stratification of the Bering Sea Water.\n",

By directly comparing efficient and inefficient acceleration events, we clearly show that prolonged southward Bz, high solar wind speed, and low dynamic pressure are critical for electron acceleration to > 1 MeV energies in the heart of the outer radiation belt. We also evaluate chorus wave evolution using the superposed epoch analysis for the identified efficient and inefficient acceleration events and find that chorus wave intensity is much stronger and lasts longer during efficient electron acceleration events, supporting the scenario that chorus waves play a key role in MeV electron acceleration.\n",

The CO2 data show a trend of ~5% per decade at ~80 km and below, in good agreement with the tropospheric trend observed at Mauna Loa. Above 80 km, the SABER CO2 trend is larger than in the lower atmosphere, reaching ~12% per decade at 110 km. The large relative trend in the upper atmosphere is consistent with results from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). On the other hand, the CO2 trend deduced from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) remains close to 5% everywhere. The spatial coverage of the SABER instrument allows us to analyze the CO2 trend as a function of latitude for the first time. The trend is larger in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere mesopause above 80 km. The agreement between SABER and ACE-FTS suggests that the rate of increase of CO2 in the upper atmosphere over the past 13 years is considerably larger than can be explained by chemistry-climate models.\n",

This empirical conclusion seemingly refutes previous decades of research defining AHG as spatially independent and site-specific. Furthermore, AMHG was the centerpiece of an unprecedented recent methodology that successfully estimated river discharge solely from satellite imagery. Despite these important implications, AMHG has remained an empirical phenomenon without theoretical explanation. Here, we provide the mathematical basis for AMHG, showing that it arises when independent AHG curves within a reach intersect near the same values of discharge and width, depth, or velocity. The strength of observed AMHG is determined by the degree of this convergence. Finally, we show that AMHG enables discharge estimation by defining a set of possible estimated discharges that often match true discharges, and propose its future interpretation as a fluvial index.\n",

The main finding in this study is that salinity potentially played an important role on changes observed in the upper-ocean; a near-surface barrier-layer likely suppressed the hurricane-induced upper-ocean cooling, leading to smaller than expected temperature changes. Post-storm observations also revealed a partial recovery of the ocean to pre-storm conditions 11 days after the hurricane. Comparison with a coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model indicates that model-observations discrepancies are largely linked to salinity effects described.

The Bouguer anomaly of craters larger than \n93-19+47 km in diameter is independent of crater size, indicating that there is a limiting depth to impact-generated porosity, presumably from pore collapse associated with either overburden pressure or viscous flow.

        "description": "\n\nThe recent increase in earthquake activity in the central U.S. has led to concerns about the hazard posed by induced earthquakes. Understanding earthquake phenomena and monitoring in all settings can be improved by the detection of small events; however, the catalog of induced earthquakes is incomplete for small events due to the sparse instrumentation. This is particularly true in settings of low background seismicity, like the central U.S. We apply single-station template matching to detect small earthquakes during the Guy-Greenbrier sequence in central Arkansas and find over 100 times more earthquakes than are registered in the Advanced National Seismic System catalog between July 2010 and October 2011. A complete catalog over nearly 4 units of magnitude enables us to analyze the magnitude-frequency distribution of induced earthquakes. We find that earthquakes deviated from the Gutenberg-Richter statistics during the operation of nearby injection wells but returned to Gutenberg-Richter statistics after the wells were shut in.\n",

To explain these coral observations, we test four hypotheses, including regional sea level changes and various tectonic mechanisms. Our results show that the coral observations likely reflect a 15\u00a0year-long slow-slip event (SSE) on the Sunda megathrust. This long-duration SSE exceeds the duration of previously reported SSEs and demonstrates the importance of multidecade geodetic records in illuminating the full spectrum of megathrust slip behavior at subduction zones.\n",

Often, the largest induced events occur after the end of injection, which complicates efforts to manage seismic risk. In this study, a three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator that couples fluid flow with earthquake simulation was used to investigate a novel hypothesis for why large postinjection seismic events occur. Fractures that form dead-end pathways differentially pressurize during injection. After injection is stopped, fluid backflows through the well from the dead-end fractures into larger fractures, inducing additional seismicity and potentially causing events larger than occurred during injection. Our simulations indicate that flowing fluid back to the surface immediately after injection could mitigate this effect and reduce postinjection seismicity.\n",

The results show that there are two distinct classes of IC lightning events with very high peak currents: the well-known narrow bipolar events, and a previously unreported type that we call energetic in-cloud pulses (EIPs). Their temporal and spatial context shows that EIPs are generated from existing negative polarity leaders that are propagating usually upward but sometimes downward. The nearly identical characteristics of EIPs and some previously reported terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) indicate a likely connection between the two, which further suggests the possibility of downward directed TGFs. These very high peak current IC events also suggest the association of EIPs with ionospheric perturbations and optical emissions known as elves.\n",

Using the typical adjustment procedure that matches the mean and standard deviation of tree ring PDSI values to those of instrumental data shows over 10 droughts from 800 to 2006 that were more severe than the 1\u2009year 2014 drought, with the 2014 drought having a return period of 140\u2013180\u2009years.

Here we present a result of 4K-cooler climate experiment. The global TC frequency significantly increases in the 4K-cooler climate compared to the present climate. This is consistent with a significant decrease in TC frequency in the 4K-warmer climate. For the mechanism of TC frequency reduction in a warmer climate, upward mass flux hypothesis and saturation deficit hypothesis have been proposed. The result of the 4K-cooler climate experiment is consistent with these two hypotheses. One very interesting point is that the experiment has clearly shown that TC genesis is possible at sea surface temperature (SST) well below 26\u00b0C which has been considered as the lowest SST limit for TC genesis.\n",

A smaller role of the Kelvin mode is diagnosed over the Indian Ocean and the maritime continent.

We present the skewness index, a metric to quantify the spatial distribution of land use within watersheds. Using this index and a river network nitrogen removal model, we quantified the effect of varying the location of developed land use within two watersheds on nutrient removal and export. The quantity and location of developed land use as well as runoff affected nitrogen removal and export. Because river network nitrogen removal is bypassed when sources are skewed toward the watershed mouth, varying the location of land use alone can double aquatic nitrogen removal. Nutrient sources skewed toward the distant headwaters maximized in-stream removal which in turn can reduce watershed export.\n",

However, the El Ni\u00f1o that started to develop in 2014 was hindered in the boreal summer, and only the ocean reached a weak El Ni\u00f1o condition. This outcome was largely attributed to a suppressed ocean-atmosphere interaction caused by anomalous easterly winds in the eastern equatorial Pacific. These winds were related to negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the southeastern subtropical Pacific (SESP). The negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) laid the foundation for the persistence of cooler SSTAs and enhanced trade winds in the SESP after the year 2000. As the recent IPO downward trend continued, the SSTAs in SESP reached an extremely low value in the boreal summer of 2014 and imposed a serious obstacle to the evolution of a warming event.\n",

We used a unique combination of spatially distributed sampling of three DOC fractions throughout a river network and modeling to quantify the net removal of terrestrial DOC during a summer base flow period. We found that aquatic reactivity of terrestrial DOC leading to net loss is low, closer to conservative chloride than to reactive nitrogen. Net removal occurred mainly from the hydrophobic organic acid fraction, while hydrophilic and transphilic acids showed no net change, indicating that partitioning of bulk DOC into different fractions is critical for understanding terrestrial DOC removal. These findings suggest that river systems may have only a modest ability to alter the amounts of terrestrial DOC delivered to coastal zones.\n",

        "description": "\n\nTo incorporate the effects of tropical cyclone (TC)-induced upper ocean mixing and sea surface temperature (SST) cooling on TC intensification, a vertical average of temperature down to a fixed depth was proposed as a replacement for SST within the framework of air-sea coupled Potential Intensity (PI). However, the depth to which TC-induced mixing penetrates may vary substantially with ocean stratification and storm state. To account for these effects, here we develop a \u201cDynamic Potential Intensity\u201d (DPI) based on considerations of stratified fluid turbulence. For the Argo period 2004\u20132013 and the three major TC basins of the Northern Hemisphere, we show that the DPI explains 11\u201332% of the variance in TC intensification, compared to 0\u201316% using previous methods. The improvement obtained using the DPI is particularly large in the eastern Pacific where the thermocline is shallow and ocean stratification effects are strong.\n",

Since 2007, LdM has experienced an unrest episode characterized by high rates of deformation. Analysis of new GPS and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data reveals uplift rates greater than 190\u00a0mm/yr between January 2013 and November 2014. The geodetic data are modeled as an inflating sill at depth. The results are used to calculate the temporal evolution of the vertical displacement. The best time function for modeling the InSAR data set is a double exponential model with rates increasing from 2007 through 2010 and decreasing slowly since 2010. We hypothesize that magma intruding into an existing silicic magma reservoir is driving the surface deformation. Modeling historical uplift at Yellowstone, Long Valley, and Three Sisters volcanic fields suggests a common temporal evolution of vertical displacement rates.\n",

To enhance the phase arrivals in stacks, we apply short-time window average over long-time window average filtering to individual traces before stacking. Although the T phase arrival is visible in stacks from seismograms filtered at 0.5\u20135\u00a0Hz, it appears much stronger at higher frequencies (2\u20138\u00a0Hz) and is further enhanced by only stacking seismograms from oceanic paths.

Our model results in an average stress drop of 6\u2009MPa, an average fault slip of 7.4\u2009m, and a moment magnitude of 7.7, consistent with regional paleoseismic data. Our corresponding tsunami model uses final seafloor displacement from the rupture model as initial conditions to compute local propagation and inundation, resulting in large peak tsunami amplitudes northward and eastward due to site and path effects.

Decreases of seismic velocities of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano inferred from seismic noise correlations have been shown to precede eruptions. However, seismic velocities are strongly influenced by rainfall and subsequent pore pressure perturbations. Here we increase the detection of precursory seismic velocity changes to an eruption by removing the effects of pore pressure changes. During 2011\u20132013, the volcano exhibits a low eruptive activity during which we observe seismic velocity variations well correlated with rainfall episodes. We estimated the transfer function between fluid pressure and seismic velocity changes. We use these results to correct seismic velocity change time series for pore pressure changes, due to rainfall and found a preeruptive velocity drop (0.15%) associated with the 21 June 2014 eruption that was undetected before correction.\n",

Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.\n",

It has been revealed that the By fluctuations accompanying substorm dipolarizations are consistent with pulses of field-aligned currents near the high-latitude edge of the plasma sheet. Detailed analysis of the By fluctuations reveals that they are near circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, most likely Alfv\u00e9n waves. Soon afterward the plasma sheet thickened and MESSENGER detected a series of compressional waves. These Alfv\u00e9nic and compressional waves have similar durations (10\u201320\u2009s), suggesting that they may arise from the same source. Drawing on Pi2 pulsation models developed for Earth, we suggest that the Alfv\u00e9nic and compressional waves reported here at Mercury may be generated by the quasi-periodic sunward flow bursts in Mercury's plasma sheet. But because they are observed during the period with rapid magnetic field reconfiguration, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of standing Alfv\u00e9n wave.\n",

Using general circulation model simulations of Titan's atmosphere, we show that atmospheric moisture transport by three-dimensional tropospheric eddies is critical in generating Titan's surface liquid asymmetry. Comparison of axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations demonstrates that a significant asymmetry only develops in the latter case. Analysis of the components of the three-dimensional moisture transport reveals that nonaxisymmetric eddies transport methane away from the poles and into the midlatitudes, where they transfer moisture into the cross-equatorial transport by the mean meridional circulation, producing an atmospheric \u201cbucket brigade.\u201d Because these high-latitude, baroclinic eddies are more intense in the south than in the north, the net transport is preferentially northward, with the northern hemisphere gaining surface liquid at the expense of the southern hemisphere.\n",

Array processing using cross-correlation lag times and semblance places constraints on the lahar's dynamics, including detection of an initial flow pulse that traveled from 2 to 12\u2009km at an average speed of 38\u2009m/s. Subsequently, the lahar signal evolved to a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located 10 to 12\u2009km from the vent and adjacent to a topographic notch, through which sound may have preferentially diffracted toward the recording site.

Electrons can rapidly gain energy from the waves when they resonate via a process called drift resonance, which is observationally characterized by energy-dependent phase differences between electron flux and electromagnetic oscillations. Such dependence has been recently observed and interpreted as spacecraft identifications of drift resonance electron acceleration. Here we show that in the initial wave cycles, the observed phase relationship differs from that characteristic of well-developed drift resonance. We further examine the differences and find that they are imprints of impulse-excited, coupled fast-Alfv\u00e9n waves before they transform into more typical standing waves. Our identification of such imprints provides a new understanding of how energy couples in the inner magnetosphere, and a new diagnostic for the generation and growth of magnetospheric hydromagnetic pulsations.\n",

In this study, we applied piecewise linear regression to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the breakpoint time of warming over 40\u2009years (1974\u20132013). Our results showed that at the global scale, mean annual temperature (MAT) over the land increased significantly until 2005 and that the warming trend then stalled. However, the breakpoint time of the warming varied greatly among different seasons and continents. We found no statistically significant breakpoint in MAT over the Northern Hemisphere, but MAT over the Southern Hemisphere showed a significant breakpoint (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in 1979. At the seasonal scale, only the winter season (December-January-February) showed a statistically significant breakpoint in global land temperature. The other seasons showed continuous increasing temperature during the whole study period. Our study examined the recent global warming hiatus on the land surface using an area-weighted summary of a scale-dependent phenomenon with substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity and revealed the winter cooling in the Northern Hemisphere low-middle latitudes in 1999\u20132008 as the major contributor to the global warming hiatus on land surface in 2005.

The relative density perturbation is found to be greater at higher altitudes. The temperature perturbation is estimated to be \u22127.0\u00a0K at 400\u00a0km. We show that the density reduction can arise from enhanced wave forcing from the lower atmosphere.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWe use a dense seismic array composed of 5200 vertical geophones to monitor microseismicity in Long Beach, California. Poor signal-to-noise ratio due to anthropogenic activity is mitigated via downward-continuation of the recorded wavefield. The downward-continued data are continuously back projected to search for coherent arrivals from sources beneath the array, which reveals numerous, previously undetected events. The spatial distribution of seismicity is uncorrelated with the mapped fault traces, or with activity in the nearby oil-fields. Many events are located at depths larger than 20 km, well below the commonly accepted seismogenic depth for that area. The seismicity exhibits temporal clustering consistent with Omori's law, and its size distribution obeys the Gutenberg-Richter relation above 20\u00a0km but falls off exponentially at larger depths. The dense array allows detection of earthquakes two magnitude units smaller than the permanent seismic network in the area. Because the event size distribution above 20\u00a0km depth obeys a power law whose exponent is near one, this improvement yields a hundred-fold decrease in the time needed for effective characterization of seismicity in Long Beach.\n",

While the Earth system continues to accumulate energy due to anthropogenic and other radiative forcings, estimates of recent surface temperature evolution fall at the lower end of climate model projections. Global mean temperatures from climate model simulations are typically calculated using surface air temperatures, while the corresponding observations are based on a blend of air and sea surface temperatures. This work quantifies a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. A further bias arises from the treatment of temperatures in regions where the sea ice boundary has changed. Applying the methodology of the HadCRUT4 record to climate model temperature fields accounts for 38% of the discrepancy in trend between models and observations over the period 1975\u20132014.\n",

The relationship between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and southern Amazon fires (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.003) was stronger than links between SSTs and either cyclones or fires alone, suggesting that fires and tropical cyclones were directly coupled to the same underlying atmospheric dynamics governing tropical moisture redistribution.

The current 3-D distribution of grain size in the mantle is, however, unknown. To explore the possible variability of grain size, we use the following: geodynamic inferences of effective viscosity, vacancy diffusion rates in upper mantle minerals and perovskite in the lower mantle, lateral variations in temperature derived from seismic images, and different geotherms. An important outcome of this modeling is a new mapping of lateral viscosity variations throughout the mantle. The corresponding 3-D variations in grain size are characterized by 2 orders of magnitude changes. We find a correlation between grain size variability in the mantle and absolute viscosity changes with depth. Our findings suggest that the traditional assumption of Arrhenius temperature dependence for vacancy diffusion in the lower mantle is not sufficient to constrain the deformation mechanisms that determine its effective bulk viscosity.\n",

Most of the obtained results are consistent with some of the known features of nighttime F region currents; others need further investigation.

In the premidnight sector at L \u223c 5.5, Van Allen Probes (Radiation Belt Storm Probes)-A observed a large dipolarization electric field (50\u00a0mV/m) over \u223c40\u00a0s and a dispersionless injection of electrons up to \u223c3\u00a0MeV. Pitch angle observations indicated betatron acceleration of MeV electrons at the dipolarization front.

Through a series of dipolarizations, the injections increased the MeV electron phase space density by 1 order of magnitude in less than 3\u00a0h in the outer radiation belt (L > 4.8).

At tidewater glacier termini, discharge drives submarine terminus melting, affects fjord circulation, and is a central component of proglacial marine ecosystems. However, our present inability to track subglacial discharge and its variability significantly hinders our understanding of these processes. Here we report observations of hourly to seasonal variations in 1.5\u201310\u2009Hz seismic tremor that strongly correlate with subglacial discharge but not with basal motion, weather, or discrete icequakes. Our data demonstrate that vigorous discharge occurs from tidewater glaciers during summer, in spite of fast basal motion that could limit the formation of subglacial conduits, and then abates during winter. Furthermore, tremor observations and a melt model demonstrate that drainage efficiency of tidewater glaciers evolves seasonally. Glaciohydraulic tremor provides a means by which to quantify subglacial discharge variations and offers a promising window into otherwise obscured glacierized environments.\n",

Specifically, we observe that a debris flow traveling along a channel filled initially with sediment 0.34\u2009m thick generates about 2 orders of magnitude less spectral power than a similar-sized flow over the same channel without sediment fill. We adapt a model from fluvial seismology to explain this observation and then invert it to estimate the level of bed sediment (and rate of entrainment) beneath a passing series of surges. Our estimates compare favorably with previous direct measurements of entrainment rates at the site, suggesting the approach may be a new indirect way to obtain rare field constraints needed to test models of debris flow entrainment.\n",

Like precipitation rate, precipitation frequency is dominated by warm rain, defined as rain produced via the liquid phase only, over the tropical oceans outside the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by cold rain, produced via the ice phase, over the midlatitude oceans and continents. Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.\n",

The first microscopic observation of fluid flow and solute transport through a rough-walled fracture was made to assess the evolution of eddies and their effect on non-Fickian tailing. A noteworthy phenomenon was observed that as the eddy grew, the particles were initially caught in and swirled around within eddies, and then cast back into main flow channel, which reduced tailing. This differs from the conventional conceptual model, which presumes a distinct separation between mobile and immobile zones. Fluid flow and solute transport modeling within the 3-D fracture confirmed tail shortening due to mass transfer by advective paths between the eddies and the main flow channel, as opposed to previous 2-D numerical studies that showed increased tailing with growing eddies.\n",

The linear cooling trend of 0.8\u00b0C/33\u2009yr is likely the result of long-term changes in equatorial ocean circulation previously identified. Moreover, the northward expansion of the cold pool is dynamically consistent with a slackening of the cross-equatorial component of the regional trade winds\u2014leading to an equatorward shift of the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent.

Flow alteration varies inversely with watershed area and, for larger streams, is compounded by upstream withdrawals. The ratio of daily permitted withdrawal to median stream flow ranges from 0.0001 to unity, although low flows in most, but not all, smaller streams are protected by pass-by flow requirements.

Our observations and three-dimensional modeling of the glacier response (velocity, thickness, temperature, density, and water content) to climate change indicate that Taconnaz glacier will become temperate and potentially unstable over a large area by the end of the 21st century.

The dense fluid mixture, which is generated at the fluid-fluid interface, leads to the onset of a convective fingering instability and triggers a fast chemical dissolution reaction. Contrary to intuition, the dissolution pattern does not map out the finger geometry. Instead, it displays a dome-like, hierarchical structure that follows the path of the ascending fluid interface and the regions of maximum mixing. These mixing and reaction hot spots coincide with the flow stagnation points, at which the interfacial mixing layer is compressed and deformed. We show that the deformation of the boundary layer around the stagnation points controls the evolution of the global scalar dissipation and reaction rates and shapes the structure of the reacted zones. The persistent compression of the mixing layer explains the independence of the mixing rate from the Rayleigh number when convection dominates.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon is tightly coupled to carbon subduction, i.e., the physical carbon transfer from the well-ventilated surface ocean to its interior. Despite their importance, pathways of anthropogenic carbon subduction are poorly understood. Here we use an ocean carbon cycle model to quantify the mechanisms controlling this subduction. Over the last decade, 90% of the oceanic anthropogenic carbon is subducted at the base of the seasonally varying mixed layer. Vertical diffusion is the primary mechanism of this subduction (contributing 65% of total subduction), despite very low local fluxes. In contrast, advection drives the spatial patterns of subduction, with high positive and negative local fluxes. Our results suggest that vertical diffusion could have a leading role in anthropogenic carbon subduction, which highlights the need for an accurate estimate of vertical diffusion intensity in the upper ocean to further constrain estimates of the future evolution of carbon uptake.\n",

Ice discharge is taken from observations since 2000 and assumed constant in time. Surface meltwater runoff is retrieved from regional climate model output for the recent past and parameterized for the future based on significant correlations between runoff and midtropospheric (500\u00a0hPa) summer temperature changes over the GrIS. The simplicity of this approach enables assimilation of meltwater runoff into coupled climate models, which is demonstrated here in a case study with the medium-resolution (1\u00b0) Community Earth System Model. The model results suggest that the decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is dominated by warming of the surface ocean and enhanced GrIS freshwater forcing leads to a slightly enhanced (\u22121.2\u00a0sverdrup in the 21st century) weakening of the AMOC.\n",

The electron trajectories are calculated and weighted using the ESA model for electron flux versus energy and L. The simulation captures the flux dropout at both GOES 13 and GOES 15 locations after a strong CME (coronal mass ejection)-shock arrival which produced a Dst\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212132\u00a0nT storm, and recovery to the prestorm value later, consistent with GOES satellite measurements. This study provides the first 3-D test particle simulation combining the trapped and injected populations. The result demonstrates that including both populations in the simulation is essential to study the dynamics of the outer radiation belt over the typical day-long timescale of ring current development, main phase, and early recovery phase.\n",

The cases of an extra long distance of PLE propagation in the Earth's ionosphere and increased value of SR Q factor have been also observed.

However, the variation of penetration electric field with local time (LT) has not been well understood. The Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite measures the plasma drift/electric field over all local times within ~100\u2009min. In this paper, we present the first nearly simultaneous observations of the dependence of penetration electric field on local time. The meridional ion drift measured by C/NOFS during the main phase of five magnetic storms in 2012 is analyzed. The storm time ion drift shows a large enhancement around 1900\u2009LT, a relatively small enhancement during daytime, and a deep decrease in the postmidnight sector with a peak around 0500\u2009LT. The observed storm time variation of the meridional ion drift with local time represents the variation of the penetration electric field.

However, the most appropriate parameters to use to specify the ULF wave diffusion rates are unknown. Empirical representations of diffusion coefficients often use Kp; however, specifications using ULF wave power offer an improved physics-based approach. We use 11\u00a0years of ground-based magnetometer array measurements to statistically parameterize the ULF wave power with Kp, solar wind speed, solar wind dynamic pressure, and Dst. We find that Kp is the best single parameter to specify the statistical ULF wave power driving radial diffusion. Significantly, remarkable high energy tails exist in the ULF wave power distributions when expressed as a function of Dst. Two-parameter ULF wave power specifications using Dst as well as Kp provide a better statistical representation of storm-time radial diffusion than any single variable alone.\n",

Specifically, the Tohoku-Oki tsunami of 11 March 2011 is modeled. It is shown that gravity wave-induced variations in the neutral wind lead to plasma velocity variations both perpendicular and parallel to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, the electric field induced by the neutral wind perturbations can map to the conjugate hemisphere. Thus, electron density variations can be generated in both hemispheres which impact the total electron content (TEC) and 6300\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0airglow emission. It is found that the TEC exhibits variations of \n\u2272\u00b10.1 total electron content unit (1 TECU\u00a0=\u00a01016\u00a0el\u00a0m\u22122) and the 6300\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0airglow emission variation is up to \u223c\u00b12.5% relative to the unperturbed background airglow.\n",

The rupture propagated east-southeast from the hypocenter for about 160\u00a0km with a duration of \u223c55\u00a0s. Backprojection of both high-frequency (HF, 0.2 to 3\u00a0Hz) and low-frequency (LF, 0.05 to 0.2\u00a0Hz) P waves suggest a multistage rupture process. From the low-frequency images, we resolve an initial slow downdip (northward) rupture near the nucleation area for the first 20\u00a0s (Stage 1), followed by two faster updip ruptures (20 to 40\u00a0s for Stage 2 and 40 to 55\u00a0s for Stage 3), which released most of the radiated energy northeast of Kathmandu. The centroid rupture power from LF backprojection agrees well with the Global Centroid Moment Tensor solution. The spatial resolution of the backprojection images is validated by applying similar analysis to nearby aftershocks. The overall rupture pattern agrees well with the aftershock distribution. A multiple-asperity model could explain the observed multistage rupture and aftershock distribution.\n",

The accumulation of magnetic particles with different grain sizes has been found in the laboratory to precede the formation of hematite (Hm), which competes with goethite (Gt) in natural systems. To explore changes in the correlation between magnetic particles and Hm during pedogenesis, we focus on three representative red Ferrasol profiles with comparable total concentrations of iron oxides but different Hm/(Hm\u2009+\u2009Gt) ratios, from 0.14 to 0.74. Superparamagnetic particles and single-domain particles commonly become enriched as the concentration of Hm increases in the profiles. However, the accumulation rates of the particles decrease with Hm/(Hm\u2009+\u2009Gt) along the profiles.

On the other hand, aftershocks that occur on adjacent fault segments outside the primary rupture may have no such size limitation. Here we use high-precision double-difference relocated earthquake catalogs to demonstrate that larger aftershocks occur farther away than smaller aftershocks, when measured from the centroid of early aftershock activity\u2014a proxy for the initial rupture. Aftershocks as large as or larger than the initiating event nucleate almost exclusively in the outer regions of the aftershock zone.

Analog and numerical models have shown variations in tectonic regime induced by slab folding over the 660\u00a0km depth discontinuity zone in orthogonal convergence. Here using a three-dimensional model of oblique subduction (30\u00b0) and accounting for free top surfaces, we show how slab folding generates an along-strike slab dip segmentation, inducing variations in topography of the overriding plate. When the subducting plate begins to curve forward, the elevation height rises inland and varies along the trench from 5\u00a0km to 2\u00a0km. The Andes are a suitable natural zone to compare our results with because of its linear margin and well-constrained plates kinematics. Thus, we provide a new explanation to the general decrease in elevation from the central to southern Andes, which still remains to be combined with other 3-D mechanisms to explain the actual Andean topography.\n",

Here we present three-dimensional upper mantle laboratory models in which a compositional plume rises underneath a subducting plate. Slab/plume buoyancy flux ratios ranged between 7 and 18. The models exhibit a two-way interaction. While the plume conduit increasingly tilts away from the trench as a result of slab rollback-induced toroidal mantle flow, the slab subduction rate decreases as a function of the amount of plume buoyancy opposing that of the slab, which gets subducted beneath the slab. We propose that our models apply to the Hainan/Manila system and explain the recently imaged tilt of the Hainan plume by the Manila slab-induced mantle return flow. The Hainan plume could lessen the Manila subduction rate from 8\u2009Ma into the future.\n",

Within the central EHS in areas directly surrounding the Namche-Barwa metamorphic massif, the average misfit of 11 stations increases to 60.8\u00b0, and vertical coherence is no longer present. The complexity of the mantle anisotropy and surface observations argues for local alteration of the strain fields here associated with recent rapid exhumation of the Indian crust.\n",

However, the stabilities and properties of CO2 at high pressures and temperatures relevant to Earth's mantle and core remain controversial. We have studied the molten structures of CO2-V with first-principles molecular dynamic calculations at 60\u2009GPa and different temperatures. The formation of oxygen molecules in the melt is consistent with experimental observations. In particular, the melting transition is accompanying by metallization. The metallic behavior is shown to originate from electron delocalization between oxygen via the overlap of the \u03c0 orbitals from the dissociated oxygen-rich species. Metallic molten CO2 is a potential candidate to explain the high conductivities of the Earth's lower mantle. Furthermore, theoretical results do not support the existence of the proposed ionic solid phase of CO2 at high temperature and high pressure.\n",

New thermochronology data synthesized with geophysical and surface process data elucidate the evolving interplay of erosion and tectonics of the colliding Yakutat microplate with North America. Focused deformation and rock exhumation occurred in the apex of the colliding plate corner from >\u20094 to 2\u2009Ma and shifted southward after the 2.6\u2009Ma climate change. The present exhumation maximum coincides with the largest modern shortening rates, highest concentration of seismicity, and the greatest erosive potential.

No general theory exists to explain the long-term evolution of yardangs, curtailing modeling of landscape evolution and dynamics of suspended sediment release. We present a hypothesis of yardang evolution using relative rates of sediment flux, interyardang corridor downcutting, yardang denudation, substrate erodibility, and substrate clast content. To develop and sustain yardangs, corridor downcutting must exceed yardang vertical denudation and deflation. However, erosion of substrate yields considerable quantities of sediment that shelters corridors, slowing downcutting. We model the evolution of yardangs through various combinations of rates and substrate compositions, demonstrating the life span, suspended sediment release, and resulting landscape evolution. We find that yardangs have a distinct and predictable evolution, with inevitable demise and unexpectedly dynamic and autogenic erosion rates driven by subtle differences in substrate clast composition.\n",

Our results suggest that salt marsh response to wind waves is tied to their local properties. In case of low-wave-energy conditions, local variability in marsh resistance might lead to the unpredictable failure of large marsh portions with respect to average erosion rates. High-wave-energy conditions, while overall leading to faster marsh deterioration, produce constant and predictable erosion rates. A high occurrence of extreme events leads to smoother and more uniformly deteriorating marsh boundary profiles.

We demonstrate that in an area of rapid mountain erosion where the landscape is highly reactive to extreme events, channel steepness measured by integrating area over upstream distance (chi analysis) can be used as an indicator of geomorphic change during flash floods. We compare normalized channel steepness to the impact of devastating floods in the upper Ganga Basin in Uttarakhand, northern India, in June 2013. The pattern of sediment accumulation and erosion is broadly predictable from the distribution of normalized channel steepness; in reaches of high steepness, channel lowering up to 5\u2009m undercut buildings causing collapse; in low steepness reaches, channels aggraded up to 30\u2009m and widened causing flooding and burial by sediment. Normalized channel steepness provides a first-order prediction of the signal of geomorphic change during extreme flood events. Sediment aggradation in lower gradient reaches is a predictable characteristic of floods with a proportion of discharge fed by point sources such as glacial lakes.\n",

Here we use side-looking, multibeam echo sounding observations to reveal that their frontal ice cliffs are grounded deeper below sea level than previously measured and their ice faces are neither vertical nor smooth but often undercut by the ocean and rough. Deep glacier grounding enables contact with subsurface, warm, salty Atlantic waters (AW) which melts ice at rates of meters per day. We detect cavities undercutting the base of the calving faces at the sites of subglacial water (SGW) discharge predicted by a hydrological model. The observed pattern of undercutting is consistent with numerical simulations of ice melt in which buoyant plumes of SGW transport warm AW to the ice faces. Glacier undercutting likely enhances iceberg calving, impacting ice front stability and, in turn, the glacier mass balance.\n",

Recent observations have identified that large waves (>3\u2009m) have a linear attenuation rate, rather than the previously assumed exponential rate that is found for small waves. This suggests that waves penetrate further into the ice cover than previously expected. To explore this further we tested two exponentially decaying wave models. Contributions from nonlinear and wind generation source terms enabled both models to reproduce the observed regime shift. Essentially, the accumulation of nonlinear and wind energy contributions to long (and thus higher amplitude) waves can offset the ice damping, thus reducing the apparent attenuation.

A strong positive trend in nitrate flux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat flux. Increased upwelling and nitrate flux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual fluctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published findings suggests that local wind intensification persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes.

        "description": "\n\nThe recent warming \u201chiatus\u201d is subject to intense interest, with proposed causes including natural forcing and internal variability. Here we derive samples of all natural and internal variability from observations and a recent proxy reconstruction to investigate the likelihood that these two sources of variability could produce a hiatus or rapid warming in surface temperature. The likelihood is found to be consistent with that calculated previously for models and exhibits a similar spatial pattern, with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation-like structure, although with more signal in the Atlantic than in model patterns. The number and length of events increases if natural forcing is also considered, particularly in the models. From the reconstruction it can be seen that large eruptions, such as Mount Tambora in 1815, or clusters of eruptions, may result in a hiatus of over 20\u2009years, a finding supported by model results.\n",

        "description": "\n\nExtratropical cyclones give rise to much of the precipitation over California. Observed California winter precipitation is highly correlated to a metric of extratropical cyclone activity over the Eastern Pacific. The lack of precipitation over the recent winters is coincident with consecutive winters of much below average cyclone activity. Analysis of variability in cyclone activity and California precipitation simulated by models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 indicates that most models can simulate the relationship between cyclone activity and precipitation well. Examination of projected change suggests (1) no evidence of a long-term downward trend in California region cyclone activity within the examined scenarios and (2) that the intermodel spread in California precipitation projection can be largely explained by the spread in the projection of extratropical cyclone activity. This highlights the need to further understand physical mechanisms for the variation in projection of cyclone activity in this region.\n",

Here we reconstructed robust Greenland temperature records (North Greenland Ice Core Project and Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) over the past 2100\u2009years using argon and nitrogen isotopes in air trapped within ice cores and show that this cold anomaly was part of a recursive pattern of antiphase Greenland temperature responses to solar variability with a possible multidecadal lag.

Examining atmospheric models running over observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), Flannaghan et al. (2014) show that this reconciliation is affected by the SST data set used and that a precipitation-weighted SST (PSST) is valuable in explaining this result. Here we show that even for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 AMIP) simulations forced with identical SSTs, tropical upper tropospheric temperature trends across models (and between ensemble members) show a substantial spread (standard deviation \u223c10% of the average trend). About 60% of this spread between ensemble means, as well as deviations from the ensemble means, can be explained by PSST calculated from the time-evolving precipitation in each model run. Both PSST and atmospheric temperature trends show statistical evidence for systematic differences between models. We conclude that the response of precipitation patterns to changes in SST patterns is a significant source of uncertainty for tropical temperature trends.\n",

Compared to the location displacement in oceanic eddy-driven jets, the magnitude change of synoptic-scale transient eddy activities, measured by eddy kinetic energy (EKE), is a more striking feature in EAEJ. An intensified EKE is projected unanimously by CMIP5 models, suggesting that potential strong winter storm events are likely to happen in East Asian midlatitude in a warming climate. The future change of EKE in EAEJ can be understood in terms of growing baroclinicity wave. The upper level EKE is highly correlated to the low-level static stability, Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency (BVF). CMIP5 models generally project an intensified upper evel EKE with a reduced low-level BVF (\u0394EKE\u2009\u221d\u2009\u2212\u0394BVF). Meanwhile, the enhancement of EKE is also constrained by its historical state (\u0394EKE\u2009\u221d\u2009\u2212EKE).

To date, we rely on climate models for estimates of dust fluxes to calculate the impact of airborne micronutrients on biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a new global dust flux data set for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions based on observational data. A comparison with dust flux simulations highlights regional differences between observations and models. By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of <10\u2009ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further ~10\u2009ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation.\n",

In a warmer climate predicted for the end of the century, the MJO increases in amplitude (by ~30%) and frequency, showing a more circumglobal propagation tendency. The MJO spatial extent becomes enhanced, deeper, and more zonally extended but meridionally confined. A stronger vertical tilting structure in diabatic heating, moisture, and convergence fields is seen. Our findings indicate that these changes result from an intensification of the frictional wave-conditional instability of the second kind mechanism via the coupling of dynamical and thermodynamic response to the warming. The warming and moistening of the mean state contribute to the enhanced deep convective heating, driving a stronger-forced Kelvin wave-like perturbation. This reinforces the frictional low-level convergence, leading to larger shallow convective heating and therefore to a faster development and enhancement of the deep convection in the MJO.\n",

We present the first acoustic images of individual return strokes at high frequencies (>1\u2009kHz) and compare the acoustically inferred profile with optical images.

On 8\u20139 July 2013, a catastrophic flood devastated the mountainous area to the northwest of the Sichuan Basin. Atmospheric simulations at a convection-permitting scale with aerosols and chemistry included show that heavy air pollution trapped in the basin significantly enhances the rainfall intensity over the mountainous areas through \u201caerosol-enhanced conditional instability.\u201d That is, aerosols suppress convection by absorbing solar radiation and increasing atmospheric stability in the basin during daytime. This allows excess moist air to be transported to the mountainous areas and orographically lifted, generating strong convection and extremely heavy precipitation at night. We show that reducing pollution in the Sichuan Basin can effectively mitigate floods.

We use a global ocean-atmosphere model of Hg (GEOS-Chem) to simulate these observed trends and determine the driving environmental variables. The atmospheric decline at northern midlatitudes can largely be explained by decreasing North Atlantic oceanic evasion. The midlatitude atmospheric signal propagates to the Arctic but is countered by rapid Arctic warming and declining sea ice, which suppresses deposition and promotes oceanic evasion over the Arctic Ocean. The resulting simulation implies a decline of Hg in the Arctic surface ocean that we estimate to be \u22120.67%\u2009yr\u22121 over the study period.

These katabatic winds are driven primarily by thermal gradients but can be exacerbated by northerly flow associated with upper level troughs passing through the western U.S. In this paper, we show that the fire danger associated with the passage of upper level troughs can be further increased by the formation of deep tropopause folds that transport extremely dry ozone-rich air from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere to the surface. Stratospheric intrusions can thus increase surface ozone both directly through transport and indirectly through their influence on wildland fires.

The first results are derived from a decade of observations by a meteor radar located at Davis Station in Antarctica and are compared with observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder instrument aboard the Aura satellite. The density of the neutral atmosphere in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere region around 70\u2013110\u00a0km is an essential parameter for interpreting airglow-derived atmospheric temperatures, planning atmospheric entry maneuvers of returning spacecraft, and understanding the response of climate to different stimuli. This region is not well characterized, however, due to inaccessibility combined with a lack of consistent strong atmospheric radar scattering mechanisms. Recent advances in the analysis of detection records from high-performance meteor radars provide new opportunities to obtain atmospheric density estimates at high time resolutions in the MLT region using the durations and heights of faint radar echoes from meteor trails. Previous studies have indicated that the expected increase in underdense meteor radar echo decay times with decreasing altitude is reversed in the lower part of the meteor ablation region due to the neutralization of meteor plasma. The height at which the gradient of meteor echo decay times reverses is found to occur at a fixed atmospheric density. Thus, the gradient reversal height of meteor radar diffusion coefficient profiles can be used to infer the height of a constant density level, enabling the observation of mesospheric density variations using meteor radar.\n",

        "description": "\n\nRecent video observations have shown that elves\u2014the visible manifestation of the lightning electromagnetic pulse (EMP) interacting with the lower ionosphere\u2014can be modulated by neutral density fluctuations at lower ionosphere altitudes due to gravity waves. The elve emissions thus illuminate the gravity wave structure. Here we use a finite difference time domain (FDTD) model of the lightning EMP to simulate elve emissions in the presence of neutral density fluctuations representative of gravity waves. We show that observable elve striations can be generated by gravity waves with a neutral density perturbation of as low as 5% at elve altitudes near 85\u00a0km. Higher perturbations lead to more pronounced striations. The depth of the optical signature perturbation is found to be similar in magnitude to the neutral density perturbation at elve altitudes, although the relationship depends on viewing geometry, gravity wave geometry, and the elve-causative lightning peak current moment.\n",
