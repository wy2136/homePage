        "description": "\n\nHere we present a long-term (1850-2200) best estimate of Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) freshwater runoff that improves spatial detail of runoff locations and temporal resolution. Ice discharge is taken from observations since 2000 and assumed constant in time. Surface meltwater runoff is retrieved from regional climate model output for the recent past, and parameterised for the future based on significant correlations between runoff and mid-tropospheric (500 hPa) summer temperature changes over theGrIS. The simplicity of this approach enables assimilation of meltwater runoff into coupled climate models, which is demonstrated here in a case study with the medium-resolution (1\u2218) Community Earth System Model (CESM). The model results suggest that the decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is dominated by warming of the surface ocean, and enhanced GrIS freshwater forcing leads to a slightly enhanced (-1.2 Sv (Sverdrup) in the 21st century) weakening of the AMOC.\n",

However, no studies have quantified the temporal dynamics of aerosol-cloud interactions with direct observations. Here, for the first time, we use temporally-offset satellite observations from northern Africa between 2006 and 2010 to quantitatively measure the effect of fire aerosols on convective cloud dynamics. We attribute a reduction in cloud fraction during periods of high aerosol optical depths to a smoke-driven inhibition of convection. We find that higher smoke burdens limit upward vertical motion, increase surface pressure, and increase low-level divergence\u2014meteorological indicators of convective suppression. These results are corroborated by climate simulations that show a smoke-driven increase in regionally averaged shortwave tropospheric heating and decrease in convective precipitation during the fire season. Our results suggest that, in tropical regions, anthropogenic fire initiates a positive feedback loop where increased aerosol emissions limit convection, dry the surface and enable increased fire activity via human ignition.\n",

Here we show that the T-phase can be observed in broad-band waveform stacks of \u223c5200 earthquakes recorded by the Global Seismic Network. To enhance the phase arrivals in stacks, we apply STA/LTA filtering to individual traces before stacking. Although the T-phase arrival is visible in stacks from seismograms filtered at 0.5-5 Hz, it appears much stronger at higher frequencies (2-8 Hz), and is further enhanced by only stacking seismograms from oceanic paths. Stacking only subsets of the data depending on continental path lengths on the receiver side shows that the T-phase can be observed at stations up to 4\u2218 inland from the coast, and changes in the T-phase arrival time correspond to reasonable crustal velocities.\n",

Our analysis reveals that permitted withdrawals range from 50\u2009m3 to more than 18,000\u2009m3/d and that water is taken from streams of all sizes, from headwater streams to eighth order rivers. Flow alteration varies inversely with watershed area, and, for larger streams, is compounded by upstream withdrawals. The ratio of daily permitted withdrawal to median stream flow ranges from 0.0001 to unity, although low flows in most, but not all, smaller streams are protected by pass-by flow requirements. Temporal changes in surface water withdrawals track gas well completion activity, rather than changes in operational strategies, and while re-use of wastewater has increased since 2009, freshwater accounted for 75% of water used in hydraulic fracturing through the peak in gas well completion activity.\n",

The erupted gas-pyroclast mixtures form jets with well-defined leading vortex rings that rise at almost constant velocity proportional to the time-averaged velocity of pyroclasts. The ejection velocity of pyroclasts decreases over time and defines a conical profile centered on the jet central streamline. Pyroclast deceleration patterns are related to their velocity and compatible with drag force, but are also strongly controlled by jet dynamics. These patterns include constant, decreasing, or abruptly increasing decelerations up to 104\u2009ms\u22122. Nonuniform deceleration focuses at the jet sides and, mostly, in a narrow zone across the vortex ring. This deceleration zone is trailed by a reduced drag zone, where deceleration is drastically reduced. In these highly transient eruptions, both zones move upwards and attenuate over time. Our results provide the first quantitative mapping of reduced drag zones.\n",

Our results are consistent with a microstructural state-variable description of dislocation-effected deformation whose rate is accelerated by grain boundary sliding.

An intriguing question is whether such MeV electron injections can populate the outer radiation belt. Here we present observations of a substorm injection of MeV electrons into the inner magnetosphere. In the pre-midnight sector at L\u223c5.5, Van Allen Probes (RBSP)-A observed a large dipolarization electric field (50mV/m) over \u223c40s and a dispersionless injection of electrons up to \u223c3 MeV. Pitch angle observations indicated betatron acceleration of MeV electrons at the dipolarization front. Corresponding signals of MeV electron injection were observed at LANL-GEO, THEMIS-D, and GOES at geosynchronous altitude. Through a series of dipolarizations, the injections increased the MeV electron phase space density by one order of magnitude in less than 3 hours in the outer radiation belt (L>4.8). Our observations provide evidence that deep injections can supply significant MeV electrons.\n",

Strong electric fields and currents due to the Hall effect are set up in narrow regions where ions are demagnetized but electrons remain magnetized. It has been recently shown that cold (few eV) ions are abundant or even dominate the Earth's magnetosphere, but most of the previous reconnection studies do not account for this population. These cold ions remain magnetized down to smaller length-scales than the hot ions, introducing a new scale into the system. In addition, the Hall currents are partially cancelled by magnetized cold ions. We use observations by the Cluster spacecraft at the Earth's magnetopause to verify that when a mixture of ions of very different temperatures is present in reconnecting plasmas, the microphysics related to the Hall effect is significantly modified.\n",

In these conditions, a motion of the X-line has been predicted in the direction of the electron diamagnetic drift. When this motion is super-Alfvenic, reconnection should be suppressed. We analysed a large dataset of Double Star TC-1 dayside magnetopause crossings, which includes reconnection and non-reconnection events. Moreover, it also includes several events during which TC-1 is near the X-line. With these close events we verified the diamagnetic suppression condition with local observations near the X-line. Moreover, with the same close events we also studied the motion of the X-line along the magnetopause. It is found that, when reconnection is not suppressed, the X-line moves northward or southward according to the orientation of the guide-field, which is related to the interplanetary magnetic field BY component, in agreement with the diamagnetic drift.\n",

This phenomenon is in contrast to before the 1998/99 regime shift. The anomalous Aleutian low pressure associated with the tropical SST forcing becomes stronger and its center shifted to the south and to the west after 1998/99. Concurrently, such a modulation causes the North Pacific SST to effectively change. This results in a close relationship between the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability. The modulation of the Aleutian low pressure is primarily due to the location of the tropical convective heating, which shifted to the west around the dateline during 1998/99. The results of simple atmospheric model experiments support this hypothesis that the shift in the tropical convective heating to the west is responsible for the modulation of the Aleutian low pressure, leading to the change in the relationship with the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability. These results imply that the predictability of the North Pacific SST after 1998/99 is enhanced due to the high correlation with the tropical Pacific SST variability.\n",

Quasi-periodic emissions in the frequency range 2\u20136 kHz were observed during a substorm on 25 January 2013 by Van Allen Probe-A and a ground-based station in the Northern Finland. The spacecraft detected the VLF signals near the geomagnetic equator in the night sector at L = 3.0-4.2 when it was inside the plasmasphere. During the satellite motion towards higher latitudes, the time interval between quasi-periodic elements decreased from 6 min to 3 min. We find one-to-one correspondence between the quasi-periodic elements detected by Van Allen Probe-A and on the ground, which indicates the temporal nature of the observed variation in the time interval between quasi-periodic elements. Multi\u0441omponent measurements of the wave electric and magnetic fields by the Van Allen Probe A show that the quasi-periodic emissions were almost circularly right-hand polarized whistler-mode waves and had predominantly small (below 30\u00b0) wave vector angles with respect to the magnetic field. In the probable source region of these signals (L about 4), we observed synchronous variations of electron distribution function at energies of 10\u201320 keV and the quasi-periodic elements. In the pause between the quasi-periodic elements pitch-angle distribution of these electrons had a maximum near 900, while they become more isotropic during the development of quasi-periodic elements. The parallel energies of the electrons for which the data suggest direct evidence of the wave-particle interactions is in a reasonable agreement with the estimated cyclotron resonance energy for the observed waves.",

The linear cooling trend of 0.8\u00b0C per 33 years is likely the result of long\u2013term changes in equatorial ocean circulation previously identified. Moreover, the northward expansion of the cold pool is dynamically consistent with a slackening of the cross\u2013equatorial component of the regional trade winds\u2014leading to an equatorward shift of the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent.

The heat content of the NSTM layer was anomalously large following summer 2007, which saw considerable sea-ice losses and intense solar absorption into the exposed surface ocean. Measurements provide evidence for the entrainment of NSTM-layer heat in fall/winter 2007\u201308 by shear-driven mixing, and convective mixing by the release of dense, salty plumes during sea-ice growth. While at least a portion of the NSTM-layer was eroded, deeper warm ocean layers remained unaffected.

To explore the possible variability of grain size, we use: geodynamic inferences of effective viscosity, vacancy diffusion rates in upper-mantle minerals and perovspkite in the lower mantle, lateral variations in temperature derived from seismic images, and different geotherms. An important outcome of this modeling is a new mapping of lateral viscosity variations throughout the mantle. The corresponding 3-D variations in grain size are characterized by two order of magnitude changes. We find a correlation between grain size variability in the mantle and absolute viscosity changes with depth. Our findings suggest that the traditional assumption of Arrhenius temperature dependence for vacancy diffusion in the lower mantle is not sufficient to constrain the deformation mechanisms that determine its effective bulk viscosity.\n",

For these estimates, we applied a novel waveform inversion formulation that mitigates the effect of Green's functions uncertainty and a hybrid back-projection method that mitigates contamination by depth phases. Our model showed that the dynamic rupture front propagated eastward from the hypocenter at 3.0 km/s and triggered a large-slip event centered about 50 km to the east. It also showed that the large-slip event included a rapid rupture acceleration event and an irregular deceleration of rupture propagation before the rupture termination. Heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy in the eastern part of the rupture area, where aftershock activity was high, inhibited rupture growth. High-frequency radiation sources tended to be in the deeper part of the large-slip area, which suggests that heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy there may have contributed to the damage in and around Kathmandu.\n",

At tidewater glacier termini, discharge drives submarine terminus melting, affects fjord circulation, and is a central component of proglacial marine ecosystems. However, our present inability to track subglacial discharge and its variability significantly hinders our understanding of these processes. Here we report observations of hourly to seasonal variations in 1.5 \u2013 10 Hz seismic tremor that strongly correlate with subglacial discharge but not with basal motion, weather, or discrete icequakes. Our data demonstrate that vigorous discharge occurs from tidewater glaciers during summer, in spite of fast basal motion that could limit the formation of subglacial conduits, and then abates during winter. Furthermore, tremor observations and a melt model demonstrate that drainage efficiency of tidewater glaciers evolves seasonally. Glaciohydraulic tremor provides a means by which to quantify subglacial discharge variations and offers a promising window into otherwise obscured glacierized environments.\n",

Over time, muds show a progressive dilution with water; the rheology is typical of pseudoplastic fluids, with a small yield stress that decreases as mud density decreases. The eruption, while not naturally-triggered, shares several similarities with natural mud volcanoes, including mud componentry, grain-size distribution, gas discharge, and mud rheology. We use the size of large ballistic fragments ejected from the vent along with mud rheology to compute a minimum ascent velocity of the mud. Computed values are consistent with in situ measurements of gas phase velocities, confirming that the stratigraphic record of mud eruptions can be quantitatively used to infer eruption history and ascent rates and hence to assess (or reassess) mud eruption hazards.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA remarkable characteristic of earthquakes is their clustering in time and space, displaying their self-similarity. It remains to be tested if natural and induced earthquakes share the same behavior. We study natural and induced earthquakes comparatively in the same tectonic setting at the Coso Geothermal Field. Covering the pre-and co-production periods from 1981 to 2013, we analyze inter-event times, spatial dimension and frequency-size distributions for natural and induced earthquakes. Individually, these distributions are statistically indistinguishable. Determining the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances in a combined space-time-magnitude metric lets us identify clear differences between both kinds of seismicity. Compared to natural earthquakes, induced earthquakes feature a larger population of background seismicity and nearest-neighbors at large magnitude-rescaled times and small magnitude-rescaled distances. Local stress perturbations induced by field operations appear to be strong enough to drive local faults through several seismic cycles and reactivate them after time-periods on the order of a year.\n",

We use remote seismic and infrasound sensors to reconstruct the eruptive sequence. The first explosions were relatively weak seismic and infrasound events. A major stratospheric ash injection occurred a few minutes later and produced long-lasting atmospheric and ground-coupled acoustic waves that were detected as far as 11,000 km by infrasound sensors, and up to 2,300 km away on seismometers. A seismic event followed ~12 minutes later and was recorded 7,000 km away by seismometers. We estimate a volcanic intensity [Pyle, 2000] around 10.9, placing the 2014 Kelud eruption between the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1991 Pinatubo eruptions intensities. We demonstrate how remote infrasound and seismic sensors are critical for the early detection of volcanic explosions, and how they can help to constrain and understand eruptive sequences\n",

The difficulty of reconciling predominantly strike-slip motion with this shortening has led to a wide range of unconventional kinematic and dynamic models. Here we determine the vertical component of motion on the fault using a 1-m-resolution elevation model derived from post-earthquake Pleiades satellite imagery. We find a constant local ratio of vertical to horizontal slip through multiple past earthquakes, suggesting the kinematic style of the Hoshab fault has remained constant throughout the Late Quaternary. We also find evidence for active faulting on a series of nearby, subparallel faults, showing that failure in large, distributed and rare earthquakes is the likely method of faulting across the eastern Makran, reconciling geodetic and long-term records of strain accumulation.\n",

Electron storm-time responses are highly dependent on both electron energy and L-shell. 10s of keV electrons typically have peak fluxes in the inner belt or near-Earth plasma sheet and fill the inner magnetosphere during storm main phases. ~100 to ~600 keV electrons are enhanced in up to 87% of cases around L~3.7, and their peak flux location moves to lower L-shells during storm recovery phases. Relativistic electrons (\u2265~1 MeV) are nearly equally likely to produce enhancement, depletion, and no-change events in the outer belt.

A leading conceptual hypothesis projects that the winds that induce coastal upwelling will intensify in response to increased land-sea temperature differences associated with anthropogenic global warming. We examine this hypothesis using an ensemble of coupled, ocean\u2013atmosphere models and find limited evidence for intensification of upwelling-favorable winds or atmospheric pressure gradients in response to increasing land-sea temperature differences. However, our analyses reveal consistent latitudinal and seasonal dependence of projected changes in wind intensity associated with poleward migration of major atmospheric high-pressure cells. Summertime winds near poleward boundaries of climatological upwelling zones are projected to intensify, while winds near equatorward boundaries are projected to weaken. Developing a better understanding future changes in upwelling winds is essential to identifying portions of the oceans susceptible to increased hypoxia, ocean acidification, and eutrophication under climate change.\n",

The first microscopic observation of fluid flow and solute transport through a rough-walled fracture was made to assess the evolution of eddies and their effect on non-Fickian tailing. A noteworthy phenomenon was observed that as the eddy grew, the particles were initially caught in and swirled around within eddies, and then cast back into main flow channel, which reduced tailing. This differs from the conventional conceptual model, which presumes a distinct separation between mobile and immobile zones. Fluid flow and solute transport modeling within the 3D fracture confirmed tail shortening due to mass transfer by advective paths between the eddies and the main flow channel, as opposed to previous 2D numerical studies that showed increased tailing with growing eddies.\n",

The results are used to calculate the temporal evolution of the vertical displacement. The best time function for modeling the InSAR data set is a double exponential model with rates increasing from 2007 through 2010 and decreasing slowly since 2011.

These rates are comparable to geological and geomorphic estimates, indicating an essentially elastic geodetic surface strain.

We find that the fault is fully locked along its complete length over about 100 km width. We don't find any resolvable aseismic barrier that could affect the seismic segmentation of the arc and limit the along strike propagation of seismic ruptures.

Despite their importance, pathways of anthropogenic carbon subduction are poorly understood. Here we use an ocean carbon cycle model to quantify the mechanisms controlling this subduction. Over the last decade, 90% of the oceanic anthropogenic carbon is subducted at the base of the seasonally-varying mixed layer. Vertical diffusion is the primary mechanism of this subduction (contributing 65% of total subduction), despite very low local fluxes. In contrast, advection drives the spatial patterns of subduction, with high positive and negative local fluxes. Our results suggestthat vertical diffusion could have a leading role in anthropogenic carbon subduction, which highlights the need for an accurate estimate of vertical diffusion intensity in the upper ocean to further constrain estimates of the future evolution of carbon uptake.\n",

In this study, we applied piecewise linear regression to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the breakpoint time of warming over 40 years (1974\u20132013). Our results showed that at the global scale, mean annual temperature (MAT) over the land increased significantly until 2005 and that the warming trend then stalled. However, the breakpoint time of the warming varied greatly among different seasons and continents. We found no statistically significant breakpoint in MAT over the Northern Hemisphere, but MAT over the Southern Hemisphere showed a significant breakpoint (P < 0.001) in 1979. At the seasonal scale, only the winter season (Dec\u2013Jan\u2013Feb) showed a statistically significant breakpoint in global land temperature. The other seasons showed continuous increasing temperature during the whole study period. Our study examined the recent global warming hiatus on the land surface using an area-weighted summary of a scale-dependent phenomenon with substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and revealed the winter cooling in the Northern Hemisphere low-mid latitudes in 1999-2008 as the major contributor to the global warming hiatus on land surface in 2005. This result highlights the importance of using a statistical method to identify the timing of climate phase change. A better understanding of the processes behind the spatiotemporal patterns of local-scale breakpoint occurrences in land surface temperature would shed new light on the mechanisms of the recent global warming hiatus.\n",

        "description": "\n\nFragmentation has been proposed as an important dynamical process in the propagation of rock avalanches. The occurrence of an intense block fragmentation inside a rock avalanche travelling on smooth inclined terrain followed by a flat region (a geometry common to many landslides), is first studied numerically by means of a discrete element 2-D code in which blocks are subjected to mutual collisions and impact with the terrain. This numerical model confirms that the locations where fragmentation is more likely to occur are those in correspondence of abrupt slope changes. We thus analyze this geometry of impact in two cases: low and high impact energy. In the first case, where recent experimental data are available, a kinematic analysis shows that the energy released at impact causes high velocities of the smallest fragments, a highly probable scenario in rock avalanche dynamics. When the impact is so energetic to disintegrate the landslide, we find that explosive fragmentation at the slope break provides an extra horizontal boost to a rock avalanche via a peculiar mechanism coupling the geometry of the slope path to the dynamics of the rock avalanche. As a consequence, a net momentum gain (boost) results along the horizontal direction due to the terrain asymmetry. However, under normal field conditions, only when the slope angle is greater than 70\u00b0 and fragmentation produces clasts of fairly uniform size, the momentum and run-out distance are significantly enhanced. Allowing for a spectrum of fragment sizes and velocities, we find a relationship between the degree of fragmentation and the magnitude of the extra boost.\n",

A strong positive trend in nitrate flux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat flux. Increased upwelling and nitrate flux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., ENSO, PDO), drive considerable interannual fluctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal timescales. However, comparison with previously published findings suggests that local wind intensification persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes.

        "description": "\n\nA new technique for determining the height of a constant density surface at altitudes of 78\u201385\u2009km is presented. The first results are derived from a decade of observations by a meteor radar located at Davis Station in Antarctica and are compared with observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder instrument aboard the Aura satellite. The density of the neutral atmosphere in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere region around 70\u2013110\u2009km is an essential parameter for interpreting airglow derived atmospheric temperatures, planning atmospheric entry maneuvers of returning spacecraft, and understanding the response of climate to different stimuli. This region is not well characterized however, due to inaccessibility combined with a lack of consistent strong atmospheric radar scattering mechanisms. Recent advances in the analysis of detection records from high performance meteor radars provide new opportunities to obtain atmospheric density estimates at high time resolutions in the MLT region using the durations and heights of faint radar echoes from meteor trails. Previous studies have indicated that the expected increase in underdense meteor radar echo decay times with decreasing altitude is reversed in the lower part of the meteor ablation region due to the neutralization of meteor plasma. The height at which the gradient of meteor echo decay times reverses is found to occur at a fixed atmospheric density. Thus, the gradient reversal height of meteor radar diffusion coefficient profiles can be used to infer the height of a constant density level, enabling the observation of mesospheric density variations using meteor radar.\n",

However, this hypothesis has been strongly challenged because of the failure to determine both the reliability of flux measurements and the exact location of fixed carbon. In this study, we added 13CO2 to natural (unsterilized) soil in the Mu Us Desert in northern China and quantified the partitioning of added 13CO2 into soil solid and vapor phases. Results show that natural desert soil absorbed 13CO2 at a mean rate of 0.28 g m\u22122d\u22121. Of the absorbed 13CO2, 7.1% was released over a 48-h period after 13CO2 feeding, 72.8% was stored in the soil solid phase, 0.0007% was found in the vapor phase, while 20.0% of the absorbed 13CO2 was undetected. These results indicate that undisturbed desert soils can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, with the majority of fixed carbon conserved in the soil solid phase.\n",

In a warmer climate predicted for the end of the century, the MJO increases in amplitude (by ~30%) and frequency, showing a more circumglobal propagation tendency. The MJO spatial extent becomes enhanced, deeper and more zonally extended but meridionally confined. A stronger vertical tilting structure in diabatic heating, moisture and convergence fields is seen. Our findings indicate that these changes result from an intensification of the frictional-wave CISK mechanism via the coupling of dynamical and thermodynamic response to the warming. The warming and moistening of the mean state contribute to the enhanced deep convective heating, driving a stronger forced Kelvin wave-like perturbation. This reinforces the frictional low-level convergence, leading to larger shallow convective heating, and therefore to a faster development and enhancement of the deep convection in the MJO.",

The results presented herein suggest that coasts fronted by relatively narrow reefs with steep fore reef slopes (~1:10 and steeper) and deeper, smoother reef flats are expected to experience the highest wave runup. Wave runup increases for higher water levels (sea level rise), higher waves and lower bed roughness (coral degradation), which are all expected effects of climate change.

Compared to the location displacement in oceanic eddy-driven jets, the magnitude change of synoptic-scale transient eddy activities, measured by eddy kinetic energy (EKE), is a more striking feature in EAEJ. An intensified EKE is projected unanimously by CMIP5 models, suggesting that potential strong winter storm events are likely to happen in East Asian midlatitude in a warming climate. The future change of EKE in EAEJ can be understood in terms of growing baroclinicity wave. The upper-level EKE is highly correlated to the low-level static stability, Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency (BVF). CMIP5 models generally project an intensified upper-level EKE with a reduced low-level BVF (\u0394EKE \u221d\u2013\u0394BVF). Meanwhile, the enhancement of EKE is also constrained by its historical state (\u0394EKE \u221d\u2013EKE).

Like precipitation rate, precipitation frequency is dominated by warm rain, defined as rain produced via the liquid phase only, over the tropical oceans outside the ITCZ and by cold rain, produced via the ice phase, over the midlatitude oceans and continents. Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and non-precipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.\n",

Here, using a three-dimensional model of oblique subduction (30\u00b0) and accounting for free top surfaces, we show how slab folding generates an along-strike slab dip segmentation, inducing variations in topography of the overriding plate.When the subducting plate begins to curve forward, the elevation height rises inland and varies along the trench from 5 km to 2 km. The Andes are a suitable natural zone to compare our results with because of its linear margin and well-constrained plates kinematics. Thus, we provide a new explanation to the general decrease in elevation from the Central to Southern Andes, but which still remains to be combined with other 3D mechanisms to explain the actual Andean topography.\n",

The elve emissions thus illuminate the gravity wave structure. Here, we use a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model of the lightning EMP to simulate elve emissions in the presence of neutral density fluctuations representative of gravity waves. We show that observable elve striations can be generated by gravity waves with a neutral density perturbation of as low as 5% at elve altitudes near 85 km. Higher perturbations lead to more pronounced striations. The depth of the optical signature perturbation is found to be similar in magnitude to the neutral density perturbation at elve altitudes, although the relationship depends on viewing geometry, gravity wave geometry, and the elve-causative lightning peak current moment.\n",

These katabatic winds are driven primarily by thermal gradients, but can be exacerbated by northerly flow associated with upper level troughs passing through the western U.S. In this paper, we show that the fire danger associated with the passage of upper level troughs can be further increased by the formation of deep tropopause folds that transport extremely dry ozone-rich air from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere to the surface. Stratospheric intrusions can thus increase surface ozone both directly through transport, and indirectly through their influence on wildland fires.

As previously reported, upper-level stability and relative humidity do control the predominance of active clouds. While cloud cover remains difficult to associate to mixed-layer parameters (small correlation coefficients), mixed-layer top vertical velocity skewness and coherent updraft fraction most significantly correlate to cumuli cloud cover and especially the portion attributed to active clouds; both of which are not currently considered in shallow cloudiness parameterizations.

Using the average empirical relationship between AMS m/z 44 and organic acids in these three studies, together with m/z 44 data from 29 continental northern hemispheric (NH) AMS datasets, we estimate that molecules containing carboxylic acid functionality constitute on average 28% (range 10-50%) of NH continental OA mass with typically higher values at rural/remote sites and during summer and lower values at urban sites and during winter.\n",

Numerical models suggest most orogens are in a transient state, but observational evidence of a spatial shift in mountain building processes due to tectonic-climate interaction are missing. New thermochronology data synthesized with geophysical, and surface process data elucidating the evolving interplay of erosion and tectonics of the colliding Yakutat microplate with North America. Focused deformation and rock exhumation occurred in the apex of the colliding plate corner from > 4 to 2 Ma and shifted southward after the 2.6 Ma climate change. The present exhumation maximum coincides with the largest modern shortening rates, highest concentration of seismicity and the greatest erosive potential. We infer that the high sedimentation caused rheological modification and the emergence of the southern St. Elias, intercepting orographic precipitation and shifting focused erosion and exhumation to the south.\n",

However, the most appropriate parameters to use to specify the ULF wave diffusion rates are unknown. Empirical representations of diffusion coefficients often use Kp; however, specifications using ULF wave power offer an improved physics-based approach. We use 11 years of ground-based magnetometer array measurements to statistically parameterise the ULF wave power with Kp, solar wind speed, solar wind dynamic pressure and Dst. We find Kp is the best single parameter to specify the statistical ULF wave power driving radial diffusion. Significantly, remarkable high energy tails exist in the ULF wave power distributions when expressed as a function of Dst. Two parameter ULF wave power specifications using Dst as well as Kp provide a better statistical representation of storm-time radial diffusion than any single variable alone.\n",

We quantify and describe interactions among driftwood, sedimentation, and vegetation for Great Slave Lake, which is used as proxy for shoreline dynamics and landforms before deforestation and wood removal along major waterways. We introduce driftcretion to describe large, persistent concentrations of driftwood that interact with vegetation and sedimentation to influence shoreline evolution. We report the volume and distribution of driftwood along shorelines, the morphological impacts of driftwood delivery throughout the Holocene, and rates of driftwood accretion. Driftcretions facilitate the formation of complex, diverse morphologies that increase biological productivity and organic carbon capture and buffer against erosion. Driftcretions should be common on shorelines receiving a large wood supply and with processes which store wood permanently. We encourage others to work in these depositional zones to understand the physical and biological impacts of large wood export from river basins.\n",

On 8\u20139 July 2013, a catastrophic flood devastated the mountainous area to the northwest of the Sichuan Basin. Atmospheric simulations at a convection-permitting scale with aerosols and chemistry included show that heavy air pollution trapped in the basin significantly enhances the rainfall intensity over the mountainous areas through \u201caerosol-enhanced conditional instability.\u201d That is, aerosols suppress convection by absorbing solar radiation and increasing atmospheric stability in the basin during daytime. This allows excess moist air to be transported to the mountainous areas and orographically lifted, generating strong convection and extremely heavy precipitation at night. We show that reducing pollution in the Sichuan Basin can effectively mitigate floods. It is suggested that coupling aerosol with meteorology can be crucial to improve weather forecast in polluted regions.\n",

Observed California winter precipitation is highly correlated to a metric of extratropical cyclone activity over the Eastern Pacific. The lack of precipitation over the recent winters is coincident with consecutive winters of much below average cyclone activity. Analysis of variability in cyclone activity and California precipitation simulated by models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 indicates that most models can simulate the relationship between cyclone activity and precipitation well. Examination of projected change suggests (1) no evidence of a long-term downward trend in California region cyclone activity within the examined scenarios and (2) that the intermodel spread in California precipitation projection can be largely explained by the spread in the projection of extratropical cyclone activity. This highlights the need to further understand physical mechanisms for the variation in projection of cyclone activity in this region.\n",

Recent observations have identified that large waves (>3\u2009m) have a linear attenuation rate, rather than the previously assumed exponential rate that is found for small waves. This suggests that waves penetrate further into the ice cover than previously expected. To explore this further we tested two exponentially decaying wave models. Contributions from nonlinear and wind generation source terms enabled both models to reproduce the observed regime shift. Essentially, the accumulation of nonlinear and wind energy contributions to long (and thus higher amplitude) waves can offset the ice damping, thus reducing the apparent attenuation. This study highlights the relevance of considering frequency dependence when analyzing wave attenuation in sea ice field data.\n",

Here we derive samples of all natural and internal variability from observations and a recent proxy reconstruction to investigate the likelihood that these two sources of variability could produce a hiatus or rapid warming in surface temperature. The likelihood is found to be consistent with that calculated previously for models and exhibits a similar spatial pattern, with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation-like structure, although with more signal in the Atlantic than in model patterns. The number and length of events increases if natural forcing is also considered, particularly in the models. From the reconstruction it can be seen that large eruptions, such as Mount Tambora in 1815, or clusters of eruptions, may result in a hiatus of over 20\u2009years, a finding supported by model results.\n",

However, a poorly sampled observational record and a diversity of model behaviors mean that the precise nature and mechanisms of this variability are unclear. Here we analyze an exceptionally large multimodel ensemble of 42 present-generation climate models to test whether NASPG mean state biases systematically affect the representation of decadal variability. Temperature and salinity biases in the Labrador Sea covary and influence whether density variability is controlled by temperature or salinity variations. Ocean horizontal resolution is a good predictor of the biases and the location of the dominant dynamical feedbacks within the NASPG. However, we find no link to the spectral characteristics of the variability. Our results suggest that the mean state and mechanisms of variability within the NASPG are not independent.

The centroid rupture power from LF backprojection agrees well with the Global Centroid Moment Tensor solution. The spatial resolution of the backprojection images is validated by applying similar analysis to nearby aftershocks. The overall rupture pattern agrees well with the aftershock distribution.

We present here the first ever observations of meter-scale fractures on the surface of a comet. Some of these fractures form polygonal networks. We present an initial assessment of their morphology, topology, and regional distribution. Fractures are ubiquitous on the surface of the comet's nucleus. Furthermore, they occur in various settings and show different topologies suggesting numerous formation mechanisms, which include thermal insulation weathering, orbital-induced stresses, and possibly seasonal thermal contraction. However, we conclude that thermal insolation weathering is responsible for creating most of the observed fractures based on their morphology and setting in addition to thermal models that indicate diurnal temperature ranges exceeding 200\u2009K and thermal gradients of ~15\u2009K/min at perihelion are possible. Finally, we suggest that fractures could be a facilitator in surface evolution and long-term erosion.\n",

We extracted surface-to-surface impulse response functions from the ambient seismic field recorded by offshore ocean bottom seismometers located atop the Nankai subduction zone and onshore stations. We showed that these offshore-onshore impulse response functions can be used to accurately simulate the long-period ground motions generated by an offshore moderate subduction earthquake. Moreover, we also found that the distributions of the earthquake and impulse response function pseudovelocity response spectra have similar maximum amplifications in the same area close to the earthquake epicenter. This suggests that the ambient seismic field recorded by the increasing number of ocean bottom seismometers around the world can be used to assess seismic hazard related to offshore subduction earthquakes without prior knowledge of the velocity structure.\n",

Using a comprehensive chemistry-climate Earth system model, we contrast model runs with varying and with fixed surface concentrations of ozone depleting substances (ODS) from 1955 to 2005. In our model, ODS cause the majority of the summertime changes in surface wind stress which, in turn, induce a clear poleward shift of the ocean's meridional overturning circulation. In addition, more than 30% of the model changes in the temperature and salinity of the Southern Ocean are caused by ODS.

Using a plasma fluid approach, we model head-on collisions between negative and positive streamers. We observe the occurrence of a very strong electric field at the location of the streamer collision. However, the enhancement of the field produces a strong increase in the electron density, which leads to a collapse of the field over only a few picoseconds. Using a Monte Carlo model, we have verified that this process is therefore not responsible for the acceleration of a significant number of electrons to energy >1\u2009keV. We conclude that no significant X-ray emission could be produced by the head-on encounter of nonthermal streamer discharges.

This combination resulted in less adiabatic expansion than usual to keep the high speed, strong magnetic field, and high density within the coronal mass ejection. Second, preceding slow and high-density solar wind was piled up ahead of the coronal mass ejection just before the arrival at the Earth to further enhance its magnetic field and density.

Turbulent eddies interacting with evaporating surfaces often induce localized and intermittent evaporative and sensible heat fluxes that leave distinct thermal signatures. These surface thermal fluctuations observable by infrared thermography (IRT) offer a means for characterization of overlaying turbulent airflows and remote quantification of surface wetness. We developed a theoretical and experimental methodology for using rapid IR surface temperature measurements to deduce surface wetness and evaporative fluxes from smooth bare soils. The mechanistic model provides theoretical links between surface thermal fluctuations, soil, and aerodynamic properties enabling thermal inferences of soil wetness with explicit consideration of soil thermal capacity and airflow turbulence effects. The method potentially improves accuracy of soil wetness assessment by IRT-based techniques whose performance is strongly influenced by surface-turbulence interactions and offers new ways for quantifying fluxes directly at their origin.\n",

Although previous statistical studies have shown that ULF waves are primarily compressional near the equator and transverse with linear polarization at higher latitude, the underlying reason for this distribution of wave polarization has not been understood. In order to address this key question, we have developed a two-dimensional, finite element code that solves the full wave equations in global magnetospheric geometry. Using this code, we show that (1) efficient mode conversion from the fast compressional waves to the ion-ion hybrid resonance occurs at Mercury consistent with previous calculations; (2) such mode-converted waves globally oscillate similar to field line resonance at Earth; and (3) compressional wave energy is primarily localized near the equator, while field-aligned transverse, linearly polarized waves generated by mode conversion at the ion-ion hybrid resonance radiate to higher latitude. Based on these wave solutions, we suggest that the strong transverse component of observed ULF waves at Mercury in high magnetic latitude can be explained as excitation of the field line resonant waves at the ion-ion hybrid resonance.\n",

One particular type of organization is the spatial self-aggregation of convection, taking the form of cloud clusters, or tropical cyclones in the presence of rotation. We show that several physical processes can give rise to self-aggregation and highlight the key features responsible for it, using idealized simulations. Longwave radiative feedbacks yield a \u201cradiative aggregation.\u201d In that case, sufficient spatial variability of radiative cooling rates yields a low-level circulation, which induces the upgradient energy transport and radiative-convective instability. Not only do vertically integrated radiative budgets matter but the vertical profile of cooling is also crucial. Convective aggregation is facilitated when downdrafts below clouds are weak (\u201cmoisture-memory aggregation\u201d), and this is sufficient to trigger aggregation in the absence of longwave radiative feedbacks.

We analyze results from new simulations of the LGM performed as part of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and PMIP phase 3. These results show no consistent relationship between the LGM tropical cooling and ECS. A radiative forcing and feedback analysis shows that a number of factors are responsible for this decoupling, some of which are related to vegetation and aerosol feedbacks. While several of the processes identified are LGM specific and do not impact on elevated CO2 simulations, this analysis demonstrates one area where the newer CMIP5 models behave in a qualitatively different manner compared with the older ensemble.

The enhanced sensitivity of the ocean's dynamic response to wind stress in El Ni\u00f1o is a primary cause for the increase in the positive dynamical feedbacks and is originated from the nonlinear response of atmospheric pattern to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, in particular the eastward shift of maximum wind loading and the equator-confined wind patch during El Ni\u00f1o.

We performed experiments to make high-resolution observations of streambed topography and solute transport over naturally formed sand bedforms in a large laboratory flume. We analyzed the results using both numerical and theoretical models. We found that fractal properties of the bed topography do indeed affect solute residence time distributions. Overall, our experimental, numerical, and theoretical results provide evidence for a coupling between the sand-bed topography and the anomalous transport scaling in rivers. Larger bedforms induced greater hyporheic exchange and faster pore water turnover relative to smaller bedforms, suggesting that the structure of legacy morphology may be more important to solute and contaminant transport in streams and rivers than previously recognized.\n",

Previous analyses of surface deformation data suggested an exponential decay of the pressure in the mud source but did not constrain the location, geometry, and evolution of the possible source(s) of the erupting mud and fluids. To map the surface deformation, we employ multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar and analyze a well-populated L-band data set acquired by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) between May 2006 and April 2011. We then apply a time-dependent inverse modeling scheme. Volume changes occur in two regions beneath Lusi, at 0.3\u20132.0\u2009km and 3.5\u20134.75\u2009km depth. The cumulative volume change within the shallow source is ~2\u20133 times larger than that of the deep source. The observation and model suggest that a shallow source plays a key role by supplying the erupting mud, but that additional fluids do ascend from depths >4\u2009km on eruptive timescales.\n",

Particles with radii a >\u223c 0.3\u03bcm were detected as single impacts. LDEX was also capable of measuring the collective signal generated from dust impacts with sizes below its single-particle detection threshold. A putative population of electrostatically lofted grains above the lunar terminator with radii of approximately 0.1\u2009\u03bcm has been suggested to exist since the Apollo era. LDEX performed the first search with an in situ dust detector for such a population. Here we present the results of the LDEX observations taken over the lunar terminator and report that within LDEX's detection limits, we found no evidence of electrostatically lofted grains in the altitude range of 3\u2013250\u2009km above the lunar terminator.\n",

They provide methods to rapidly assess earthquakes to predict damaging ground shaking. Preventing false alarms from these systems is key. Here we developed a simple, robust algorithm, Authorizing GRound shaking for Earthquake Early warning Systems (AGREEs), to reduce falsely issued alarms. This is a network threshold-based algorithm, which differs from existing approaches based on apparent velocity of P and S waves. AGREEs is designed to function as an external module to support existing earthquake early warning systems (EEWSs) and filters out the false events, by evaluating actual shaking near the epicenter. Our retrospective analyses of the 2009 L'Aquila and 2012 Emilia earthquakes show that AGREEs could help an EEWS by confirming the epicentral intensity. Furthermore, AGREEs is able to effectively identify three false events due to a storm, a teleseismic earthquake, and broken sensors in Irpinia Seismic Network, Italy.\n",

We provide evidence for TDOC priming using a lab-based microcosm experiment in which TDOC was primed by the addition of 13C-labeled algal dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) or a 13C-labeled disaccharide (trehalose). The rate of TDOC remineralization to carbon dioxide (CO2) occurred 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 and 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 times more rapidly with the addition of trehalose and ADOC, respectively, relative to experiments with TDOC as the sole carbon source over the course of a 301\u2009h incubation period. Results from these controlled experiments provide fundamental evidence for the occurrence of priming of TDOC by ADOC and a simple disaccharide. We suggest that priming effects on TDOC should be considered in carbon budgets for large-river deltas, estuaries, lakes, hydroelectric reservoirs, and continental shelves.\n",

To clarify the question we use a database of substorm onsets and found the evident dependence of the substorm probability on the solar wind flow direction jumps (asymmetric factor), while distribution of the substorm occurrence on the solar wind number density jumps (symmetric factor) is homogeneous. The theoretical interpretation is based on the extension of the existing symmetric Kan model for a bent current sheet. Allowing the model tilt angle to vary in time, we found that the induced electric field penetrates to the central region of the bent current sheet. If the solar wind direction jump increases the bending, then induced electric field thins the current sheet and thus stimulates the reconnection. In the opposite case the current sheet thickens. We claim that this effect is sufficient (provides twice or more thinning of the current sheet in 10\u2009min).\n",

This premidnight surge is preceded by strong westward winds. These disturbances were observed over three sites with geodetic latitudes 35\u201342\u00b0N in the American sector by Fabry-Perot interferometers at 630\u2009nm wavelength. Prior to the wind disturbances, subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) were measured by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar between 20 and 02\u2009UT. We identify the observed neutral wind variations as driven by SAPS, through a scenario where strong ion flows cause a westward neutral wind, subsequently establishing a poleward wind surge due to the poleward Coriolis force on that westward wind. These regional disturbances appear to have prevented the well-known storm time equatorward wind surge from propagating into low latitudes, with the consequence that the classic disturbance dynamo mechanism failed to occur.\n",

However, the Hf and Sr isotopic compositions of dust are highly dependent on particle size to accurately identify dust provenance. Here we compare the Hf-Nd-Sr isotopic compositions of clay-sized fractions from dust sources (the Mongolian Plateau) to sinks (Beijing and Greenland). Our results document that clay-sized Hf-Nd-Sr isotopic compositions of Mongolian dust are controlled by two isotopic/geochemical provinces: Southern Mongolian Gobi (SMG) and Northern Mongolian Plateau (NMP). Our data indicate that the SMG is potentially an important dust source to the loess in Beijing and Hulun Buir and could be a contributing source of dust to Greenland, whereas the NMP contributes little dust to the Chinese loess and the Greenland. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deserts of northwest China are one of the main dust contributors to Beijing and Greenland, but not to Hulun Buir.\n",

The results show that the PCM can capture around 50% of the observed variability associated with the Atlantic Ni\u00f1o from 1958 to 2013, but only when the bias is substantially reduced using heat flux correction, with no skill otherwise. We further show that ocean dynamics explain a large part of the SST variability in the eastern equatorial Atlantic in both observations (50\u201360%) and the PCM experiments (50\u201370%) with heat flux correction, implying that the seasonal predictability potential may be higher than currently thought.\n",

In partially saturated porous media, the intricate spatial distributions of the wetting and nonwetting phases causes their flow to be focused onto preferential paths. Using a novel 2-D experimental setup allowing pore-scale measurement of concentration fields in a controlled unsaturated flow, we highlight mechanisms by which mixing of an invading fluid with the resident fluid is significantly enhanced when decreasing saturation. The mean scalar dissipation rate is observed to decrease slowly in time, while under saturated conditions it decays rapidly. This slow decrease is due to sustained longitudinal solute fingering, which causes concentration gradients to remain predominantly transverse to the average flow. Consequently, the effective reactivity is found to be much larger than under saturated conditions. These results provide new insights into the role that multiphase flows play on mixing/reaction in porous media.\n",

However, in forested catchments passage of rainfall through the canopy will alter the tracer signature of throughfall (TF) via interception. Here we test the effect of using TF instead of OP on TTD estimates. We sampled a 0.39\u2009km2 catchment (W\u00fcstebach, Germany) for a 19\u2009month period using weekly precipitation and stream isotope data to evaluate changes in stream isotope simulation and TTDs. We found that TF had different effects on TTDs for \u03b418O and \u03b42H, with TF leading to up to 4\u2009months shorter transit times. TTDs converged for both isotopes only when using TF. TF improved the stream isotope simulations. These results demonstrate the importance of canopy-induced isotope tracer changes in estimating streamwater TTDs in forested catchments.\n",

Using a full energy Monte Carlo model combined with an optical emission model, we quantify the optical emissions induced by the strong acceleration of thermal runaway electrons in the highly inhomogeneous electric field produced by stepping lightning leaders. The results demonstrate that this acceleration process is accompanied with not only high-energy X-ray emissions but also detectable levels of optical emissions. The fluorescence beam exhibits a conical shape and appears to be larger than the streamer zone associated with the lightning leader. Moreover, we emphasize that the size of the fluorescence beam largely depends on the electrical properties of the associated lightning leader and the intensity ratio between emissions from the second positive band system of N2 and the first negative band system of N\n2+ reflects the intrinsic difference in the energetics of electrons involved. Therefore, corresponding measurements compared to modeling results can provide useful information for understanding of the stepping mechanism of lightning leaders and associated X-ray production processes.\n",

Using 22 global circulation models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, we evaluate, globally, the mean, standard deviation, and the 95th percentiles of IVT from the historical simulations (1979\u20132005) and two emissions scenarios (2073\u20132099). Considering the more extreme emissions, multimodel mean IVT increases by 30\u201340% in the North Pacific and North Atlantic storm tracks and in the equatorial Pacific Ocean trade winds.

By using observed ocean heat transport and sea ice area, the proposed framework appears skillful and explains 50% of the observed sea ice variance up to 2\u2009years in advance. The qualitative prediction of increase versus decrease in ice cover is correct 88% of the time. Model imperfections can largely be diagnosed from simultaneous meridional winds. The framework and skill are supported by a 60\u2009year simulation from a regional ice-ocean model.

We also show that parallel propagating waves are predominantly generated in this configuration, but geometrical effects related to the phase space density in wave vector space lead to apparent predominance of obliquely propagating waves.

To represent how an ecosystem process responds to projected future changes, we methodically sample, using a simple sensitivity analysis, how an ecosystem variable responds locally to projected regional temperature and precipitation changes.

Forecast of vegetation anomalies at 1\u20133\u2009months lead time can help in decision making. Here we show that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) along with other hydroclimatic variables (soil moisture and sea surface temperature) can be effectively used to predict vegetation anomalies in India. The spatiotemporal analysis of NDVI showed significant greening over the region during the period of 1982\u20132013. The root-zone soil moisture showed a positive correlation with NDVI, whereas the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation index (Nino 3.4) is negatively correlated in most of the regions. We extended this relationship to develop a model to predict NDVI in 1 to 3\u2009months lead time. The predicted vegetation anomalies compare well with observations, which can be effectively utilized in early warning and better planning in water resources and agricultural sectors in India.\n",

Examples of onboard-processed delay-Doppler maps reveal excellent data quality for winds up to 27.9\u2009m/s. Collocated Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds are used to develop and evaluate a wind speed algorithm based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the bistatic radar equation. For SNRs greater than 3\u2009dB, wind speed is retrieved without bias and a precision around 2.2\u2009m/s between 3 and 18\u2009m/s even without calibration. Exploiting lower SNR signals, however, requires good knowledge of the antenna beam, platform attitude, and instrument gain setting.

Here we aim to quantify the natural variability of the SH extratropical circulation by using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) preindustrial control model runs and compare with the observed trends in SAM, jet magnitude, and jet location. We show that trends in SAM are due partly to external forcing but are not outside the natural variability as described by these models. Trends in jet location and magnitude, however, lie outside the unforced natural variability but can be explained by a combination of natural variability and the ensemble mean forced trend. These results indicate that trends in these three diagnostics cannot be used interchangeably.\n",

Previous studies confirmed the existence of such electric fields. However, the present study shows that upward field-aligned electric field can be found within upward field-aligned current (FAC) region. In the upward FAC region, upward electric field that accelerates electron downward is seen with the occurrence rates of 82%\u201396%. In contrast, the occurrence rates in the downward FAC regions are 3%\u201311%. Polar rain electrons located in the upward FAC region adjacent to closed field lines often show a ramping up of energy with increasing latitude before reaching a plateau. This plateau may be attributed to the magnetosheath electrons that progressively have higher antisunward velocity and lower density with increasing distance from the subsolar point before they asymptotically reach the solar wind values.\n",

Sunlight ionizes neutrals, producing photoelectrons with characteristic energy spectra. The Cassini plasma spectrometer electron spectrometer has detected photoelectrons throughout these regions, where photoelectrons may be used as tracers of magnetic field morphology. They also enhance plasma escape by setting up an ambipolar electric field, since the relatively energetic electrons move easily along the magnetic field. A similar mechanism is seen in the Earth's polar wind and at Mars and Venus. Here we present a new analysis of Titan photoelectron data, comparing spectra measured in the sunlit ionosphere at ~1.4 Titan radii (RT) and at up to 6.8 RT away. This results in an upper limit on the potential of 2.95\u2009V along magnetic field lines associated with Titan at up to 6.8 RT, which is comparable to some similar estimates for photoelectrons seen in Earth's magnetosphere.",

Except for two X-lines from multiple reconnection, all the X-lines move tailward (radial outward) along the current sheet, which is consistent with the direction of the pressure gradient. The X-lines also propagate outward from the midnight sector in the dawn-dusk direction. The X-line speed in the Earth-tail direction is comparable and proportional to the reconnection inflow speed and approximately 0.1 of the reconnection outflow speed.

This occurred despite the fact that both shock and CME were weak and relatively slow.

It has been also pointed out that pitch angle scattering of \u223ckeV electrons by whistler mode waves results in diffuse auroras. Thus, it is natural to expect relativistic electron precipitations associated with diffuse auroras. Based on a conjugate observation between the SAMPEX spacecraft and the all-sky TV camera at Syowa Station, we report, for the first time, a case in which relativistic electron precipitations are associated with diffuse aurora. The SAMPEX observation shows that the precipitations of > 1\u2009MeV electrons are well accompanied with those of > 150 and > 400\u2009keV electrons. This indicates that electrons in the energy range from several keV to > 1\u2009MeV precipitate into the atmosphere simultaneously.

Earlier studies have demonstrated that such instability can occur near proton harmonic frequencies and near perpendicular propagation with a narrow range of wave normal angle about 90\u00b0 and that the waves may contribute significantly to electron acceleration in the radiation belt. However, this effect is sensitive to the values of wave normal angles. Instability characteristics in the regime of weak instability, in particular the dependence on the wave frequency and wave normal angle, is investigated for an ion ring distribution modeled by subtraction of two anisotropic Maxwellian distributions. It is found that two types of instabilities, resonant and nonresonant, occur near 90\u00b0 wave normal angles. Physics of the two instabilities is explained and discussed. The resonant instability, occurring at a finite parallel wave number k\u2225, is caused by resonant protons near 90\u00b0 pitch angle, while the nonresonant instability, occurring for a vanishing k\u2225, is driven by all thermal protons.

The compression on the dawnside is preceded and followed by expansions. For a moderately strong shock, the expansion magnitude reaches several RE behind the terminator plane. The magnetopause and cross-tail currents in the magnetotail are significantly deformed during and after the shock passage. The position of the magnetotail magnetopause moves by more than 10\u2009RE.

Modeling suggests a substantial fluence of low-density dust particles 1\u2013100\u2009\u00b5m in size, with the large amount and small size contrary to predictions. The event created a temporary planet-wide ionospheric layer below Mars' main dayside ionosphere. The dramatic meteor shower response at Mars is starkly different from the case at Earth, where a steady state metal layer is always observable but perturbations caused by even the strongest meteor showers are challenging to detect.",

However, fundamental questions remain: Is Venus still volcanically active today, and if so, where and in what geological and geodynamic environment? Here we show evidence from the Venus Express Venus Monitoring Camera for transient bright spots that are consistent with the extrusion of lava flows that locally cause significantly elevated surface temperatures. The very strong spatial correlation of the transient bright spots with the extremely young Ganiki Chasma, their similarity to locations of rift-associated volcanism on Earth, provide strong evidence for their volcanic origin and suggests that Venus is currently geodynamically active.",

In this study, we report a new convective regime in which a ridge can form without destabilizing the surrounding lithosphere or forming subduction zones. Using simulations in 2-D spherical annulus geometry, we show that a depth-dependent yield stress is sufficient to reach this ridge only regime. This regime occurs when the friction coefficient is close to the critical value between mobile lid and stagnant lid regimes. Maps of convective regime as a function of the parameters friction coefficients and depth dependence of viscosity are provided for both basal heating and mixed heating situations. The ridge only regime appears for both pure basal heating and mixed heating mode. For basal heating, this regime can occur for all vertical viscosity contrasts, while for mixed heating, a highly viscous deep mantle is required.",

A large (6\u201310\u2009km3) collapse of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano at ~130\u2009ka was followed by explosive basaltic volcanism and the formation of a new basaltic volcanic center, the South Soufri\u00e8re Hills, estimated to have initiated <100\u2009years after collapse. This basaltic volcanism was a sharp departure from the andesitic volcanism that characterized Soufri\u00e8re Hills' activity before the collapse. Mineral-melt thermobarometry demonstrates that the basaltic magma's transit through the crust was rapid and from midcrustal depths.

In this letter, we present measurements of forces between two calcite surfaces in air and water-glycol mixtures using the atomic force microscope. We show a time- and load-dependent adhesion at low water concentrations and a strong repulsion in the presence of water, which is most likely due to hydration of the strongly hydrophilic calcite surfaces. We argue that this hydration repulsion can explain the commonly observed water-induced decrease in strength in calcitic rocks and single calcite crystals. Furthermore, this relatively simple experimental setup may serve as a useful tool for analyzing surface forces in other mineral-fluid combinations.",

Our results confirm that the barrier may slow down or stop coseismic ruptures but may also induce supershear ruptures. We demonstrate that the supershear rupture may emerge in a region that is delineated by two approximate linear boundaries. If the barrier size is below the lower boundary, ruptures can overcome the barrier and propagate at subshear speeds. If the barrier size is larger than the upper boundary, ruptures are always stopped by the barrier. Furthermore, we find that the barrier-induced supershear ruptures may eventually slow down into subshear speed, depending on the size and the location of the barrier. The duration of supershear ruptures increases as the barrier sizes grow from the lower to the upper boundary, which are proportional to the reduction in rupture speeds caused by the barrier. These results indicate that a barrier on the fault may not stop coseismic ruptures. Rather, the barrier may induce ruptures propagating at supershear speeds that play important roles in near-field ground shaking and damage.",

        "description": "\nThe dynamical link between the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) remains poorly understood. This partly arises from the complex Agulhas leakage, which occurs via rings, cyclones, and non-eddy flux. Hindcast simulations suggest that leakage has recently increased but have not decomposed this signal into its constituent mechanisms. Here these are isolated in a realistic ocean model. Increases in simulated leakage are attributed to stronger eddy and non-eddy-driven transports, and a strong warming and salinification, especially within Agulhas rings. Variability in both regimes is associated with strengthening Indian Ocean westerly winds, reflecting an increasingly positive Southern Annular Mode. While eddy and non-eddy flux signals are tied through turbulent eddy dissipation, the ratio between the two varies decadally. Consequently, while altimetry suggests a recent increase in retroflection turbulence and implied leakage, non-eddy flux may also play a significant role in modulating the leakage AMOC connection.",

To determine the impact of this accelerating meltwater flux on Baffin Bay, we examine eight numerical experiments using an ocean-sea ice model: Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean. Enhanced runoff causes shoreward increasing sea surface height and strengthens the stratification in Baffin Bay. The changes in sea surface height reduces the southward transport through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and strengthens the gyre circulation within Baffin Bay. The latter leads to further freshening of surface waters as it produces a larger northward surface freshwater transport across Davis Strait. Increasing the meltwater runoff leads to a warming and shallowing of the west Greenland Irminger water on the northwest Greenland shelf. These warmer waters can now more easily enter fjords on the Greenland coast and thus provide additional heat to accelerate the melting of marine-terminating glaciers.",

The impact of ocean acidification is challenging to predict as each species appears to respond differently and because our knowledge of natural changes to ocean pH is limited in both time and space. Here we reconstruct 222\u2009years of biennial seawater pH variability in the Sargasso Sea from a brain coral, Diploria labyrinthiformis. Using hydrographic data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study and the coral-derived pH record, we are able to differentiate pH changes due to surface temperature versus those from ocean circulation and biogeochemical changes. We find that ocean pH does not simply reflect atmospheric CO2 trends but rather that circulation/biogeochemical changes account for >90% of pH variability in the Sargasso Sea and more variability in the last century than would be predicted from anthropogenic uptake of CO2 alone.",

We measured isothermal remanence acquisition curves of North Atlantic deep-sea sediments drilled at the Gardar Drift and decomposed the first derivatives of these curves into high-coercivity and low-coercivity components. Residuals of the decomposition were sufficiently small throughout the study interval, confirming that the Gardar Drift sediments represent a mixing of the two end-members. Fractional changes of the high-coercivity component represent variation of the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water, a branch of NADW formed at the Nordic Seas.

This paper examines this linear approximation using a zero-dimensional energy balance model with a temperature-dependent feedback, with parameter values drawn from physical arguments and general circulation models. For a positive feedback temperature dependence, warming increases Earth's sensitivity, while greater sensitivity makes Earth warm more. These effects can feed on each other, greatly amplifying warming. As a result, for reasonable values of feedback temperature dependence and preindustrial feedback, Earth can jump to a warmer state under only one or two CO2 doublings. The linear approximation breaks down in the long tail of high climate sensitivity commonly seen in observational studies. Understanding feedback temperature dependence is therefore essential for inferring the risk of high warming from modern observations. Studies that assume linearity likely underestimate the risk of high warming.",

Deep lakes and lakes with high average temperatures have experienced the largest changes in lake stratification even though their surface temperatures tend to be warming more slowly.

However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that can significantly influence the rate of basal melting of Antarctic marine ice shelves and the associated SLR have not previously been considered. Here we use a fully coupled global climate model to investigate whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations after a period of global warming could preserve Antarctic ice sheets by cooling subsurface ocean temperatures. We contrast this climate engineering method with an alternative strategy in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract surface and upper level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing GHGs, resulting in continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves, especially in the vicinity of the already unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. By contrast, removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica.",
