Zhang, B. Yu, X. Wang, C.-J. Lin, and X. B. Feng<br /><br />China presently contributes the largest amount of anthropogenic mercury (Hg)\nemission into the atmosphere in the world. Over the past decade, numerous\nstudies have been conducted to characterize the concentration and forms of\natmospheric Hg in China, which provide insights into the spatial and temporal\ndistributions of atmospheric Hg through ground-based measurements at widely\ndiverse geographical locations and during cruise and flight campaigns. In\nthis paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state of understanding\nin atmospheric Hg in China. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and\nparticulate-bound mercury (PBM) measured at the remote sites in China are\nsubstantially elevated compared to the background values in the Northern\nHemisphere. In Chinese urban areas, the highly elevated GEM, PBM and gaseous\noxidized mercury (GOM) were mainly derived from local anthropogenic Hg\nemissions, whereas regional anthropogenic emissions and long-range transport\nfrom domestic source regions are the primary causes of the elevated GEM and\nPBM concentrations at remote sites. Using 7\u20139 years of continuous\nobservations at a remote site and an urban site, a slight increase in\natmospheric GEM (2.4\u20132.5 % yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was identified (paired samples\ntest: <i>p</i> < 0.01), which is in agreement with the increasing\ndomestic anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic GEM emission quantity in\nChina estimated through the observed GEM / CO concentration ratios ranged\nfrom 632 to 1138 t annually over the past decade, 2\u20133 times larger than\npublished values using emission activity data. Modeling results and filed\nmeasurements show dry deposition is the predominant process for removing Hg\nfrom the atmosphere, 2.5\u20139.0 times larger than wet deposition, due to the\nelevated atmospheric GEM and PBM concentrations that facilitate dry\ndeposition to terrestrial landscapes. Further studies to reconcile the\nobserved and simulated Hg concentrations, to understand the impact of\ndomestic emission reduction on Hg concentration and deposition and to\ndelineate the role of Hg emission and deposition of China in the global Hg\nbiogeochemical cycle, are needed.",

Shi, A. M. Buffen, M. G. Hastings, C. Li, H. Ma, Y. Li, B. Sun, C. An, and S. Jiang<br /><br />Snowpits along a traverse from coastal East Antarctica to the summit of the\nice sheet (Dome Argus) are used to investigate the post-depositional\nprocessing of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) in snow. Seven snowpits from sites with accumulation\nrates between 24 and 172 kg m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup> were sampled to depths of\n150 to 300 cm. At sites from the continental interior (low accumulation,\n< 55 kg m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>&minus;1</sup>), nitrate mass fraction is generally\n> 200 ng g<sup>\u22121</sup> in surface snow and decreases quickly with\ndepth to < 50 ng g<sup>\u22121</sup>. Considerably increasing values of\n\u03b4<sup>15</sup>N of nitrate are also observed (16\u2013461 &permil;\nvs. air N<sub>2</sub>), particularly in the top 20 cm, which is consistent with\npredicted fractionation constants for the photolysis of nitrate. The\n\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of nitrate (17\u201384 &permil; vs. VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean\nWater)), on the\nother hand, decreases with increasing \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N, suggestive of\nsecondary formation of nitrate in situ (following photolysis) with a low\n\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O source. Previous studies have suggested that &delta;<sup>15</sup>N and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of nitrate at deeper snow depths should be\npredictable based upon an exponential change derived near the surface. At\ndeeper depths sampled in this study, however, the relationship between\nnitrate mass fraction and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O changes, with increasing\n\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of nitrate observed between 100 and 200 cm. Predicting the\nimpact of post-depositional loss, and therefore changes in the isotopes with\ndepth, is highly sensitive to the depth interval over which an exponential\nchange is assumed. In the snowpits collected closer to the coast\n(accumulation > 91 kg m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>&minus;1</sup>), there are no obvious\ntrends detected with depth and instead seasonality in nitrate mass fraction\nand isotopic composition is found. In comparison to the interior sites,\nthe coastal pits are lower in \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N (\u221215\u201371 &permil; vs. air N<sub>2</sub>) and higher in \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of\nnitrate (53\u2013111 &permil; vs. VSMOW). The relationships found\namongst mass fraction, \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N, \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O and &Delta;<sup>17</sup>O (\u0394<sup>17</sup>O = &delta;<sup>17</sup>O\u20130.52 \u00d7 \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O) of nitrate cannot be explained by local post-depositional\nprocesses alone, and are instead interpreted in the context of a primary\natmospheric signal. Consistent with other Antarctic observational and\nmodeling studies, the isotopic results are suggestive of an important\ninfluence of stratospheric ozone chemistry on nitrate formation during the\ncold season and a mix of tropospheric sources and chemistry during the warm\nseason. Overall, the findings in this study speak to the sensitivity of\nnitrate isotopic composition to post-depositional processing and highlight\nthe strength of combined use of the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes for a\nmechanistic understanding of this processing.",

Stohl<br /><br />The concentrations of sulfate, black carbon (BC) and other aerosols in the\nArctic are characterized by high values in late winter and spring (so-called\nArctic Haze) and low values in summer. Models have long been struggling to\ncapture this seasonality and especially the high concentrations associated\nwith Arctic Haze. In this study, we evaluate sulfate and BC concentrations\nfrom eleven different models driven with the same emission inventory against\na comprehensive pan-Arctic measurement data set over a time period of 2 years\n(2008\u20132009). The set of models consisted of one Lagrangian particle\ndispersion model, four chemistry transport models (CTMs), one atmospheric\nchemistry-weather forecast model and five chemistry climate models (CCMs), of\nwhich two were nudged to meteorological analyses and three were running\nfreely. The measurement data set consisted of surface measurements of\nequivalent BC (eBC) from five stations (Alert, Barrow, Pallas, Tiksi and\nZeppelin), elemental carbon (EC) from Station Nord and Alert and aircraft\nmeasurements of refractory BC (rBC) from six different campaigns. We find\nthat the models generally captured the measured eBC or rBC and sulfate\nconcentrations quite well, compared to previous comparisons. However, the\naerosol seasonality at the surface is still too weak in most models.\nConcentrations of eBC and sulfate averaged over three surface sites are\nunderestimated in winter/spring in all but one model (model means for\nJanuary\u2013March underestimated by 59 and 37 % for BC and sulfate,\nrespectively), whereas concentrations in summer are overestimated in the\nmodel mean (by 88 and 44 % for July\u2013September), but with overestimates\nas well as underestimates present in individual models. The most pronounced\neBC underestimates, not included in the above multi-site average, are found\nfor the station Tiksi in Siberia where the measured annual mean eBC\nconcentration is 3 times higher than the average annual mean for all other\nstations. This suggests an underestimate of BC sources in Russia in the\nemission inventory used. Based on the campaign data, biomass burning was\nidentified as another cause of the modeling problems. For sulfate, very large\ndifferences were found in the model ensemble, with an apparent\nanti-correlation between modeled surface concentrations and total atmospheric\ncolumns. There is a strong correlation between observed sulfate and eBC\nconcentrations with consistent sulfate/eBC slopes found for all Arctic\nstations, indicating that the sources contributing to sulfate and BC are\nsimilar throughout the Arctic and that the aerosols are internally mixed and\nundergo similar removal. However, only three models reproduced this finding,\nwhereas sulfate and BC are weakly correlated in the other models. Overall, no\nclass of models (e.g., CTMs, CCMs) performed better than the others and\ndifferences are independent of model resolution.",

Ding, R. J. van der A, B. Mijling, P. F. Levelt, and N. Hao<br /><br />The Nanjing Government applied temporary environmental regulations to\nguarantee good air quality during the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2014. We\nstudy the effect of those regulations by applying the emission estimate\nalgorithm DECSO (Daily Emission estimates Constrained by Satellite\nObservations) to measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We\nimproved DECSO by updating the chemical transport model CHIMERE from v2006 to\nv2013 and by adding an Observation minus Forecast (OmF) criterion to filter\noutlying satellite retrievals due to high aerosol concentrations. The\ncomparison of model results with both ground and satellite observations\nindicates that CHIMERE v2013 is better performing than CHIMERE v2006. After\nfiltering the satellite observations with high aerosol loads that were\nleading to large OmF values, unrealistic jumps in the emission estimates are\nremoved. Despite the cloudy conditions during the YOG we could still see a\ndecrease of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> column concentrations of about 32 % in\nthe OMI observations when compared to the average NO<sub>2</sub> columns from 2005 to\n2012. The results of the improved DECSO algorithm for NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions show\na reduction of at least 25 % during the YOG period and afterwards. This\nindicates that air quality regulations taken by the local government have an\neffect in reducing NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. The algorithm is also able to detect\nan emission reduction of 10 % during the Chinese Spring Festival. This\nstudy demonstrates the capacity of the DECSO algorithm to capture the change\nof NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions on a monthly scale. We also show that the observed\nNO<sub>2</sub> columns and the derived emissions show different patterns that\nprovide complimentary information. For example, the Nanjing smog episode in\nDecember 2013 led to a strong increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations without an\nincrease in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. Furthermore, DECSO gives us important\ninformation on the non-trivial seasonal relation between NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions\nand NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on a local scale.",

Tang, J. An, F. Wang, Y. Li, Y. Qu, Y. Chen, and J. Lin<br /><br />Many field experiments have found high nitrous acid (HONO) mixing ratios in\nboth urban and rural areas during daytime, but these high daytime HONO\nmixing ratios cannot be explained well by gas-phase production, HONO\nemissions, and nighttime hydrolysis conversion of nitrogen dioxide\n(NO<sub>2</sub>) on aerosols, suggesting that an unknown daytime HONO source\n(<i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub>) could exist. The formula <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> &approx; 19.60[NO<sub>2</sub>] &middot;\n<i>J</i>(NO<sub>2</sub>) was obtained using observed data from 13 field experiments across\nthe globe. The three additional HONO sources (i.e., the <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub>,\nnighttime hydrolysis conversion of NO<sub>2</sub> on aerosols, and HONO emissions)\nwere coupled into the WRF-Chem model (Weather Research and Forecasting model\ncoupled with Chemistry) to assess the <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> impacts on the\nconcentrations and budgets of HONO and peroxy (hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and\norganic peroxy) radicals (RO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) (= OH + HO<sub>2</sub>  + RO<sub>2</sub>) in\nthe coastal regions of China. Results indicated that the additional HONO\nsources produced a significant improvement in HONO and OH simulations,\nparticularly in the daytime. High daytime average <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> values were\nfound in the coastal regions of China, with a maximum of 2.5 ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup> in\nthe Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region. The <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> produced a\n60\u2013250 % increase of OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub> near the ground in the\nmajor cities of the coastal regions of China, and a 5\u201348 % increase\nof OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub> in the daytime meridional-mean mixing ratios\nwithin 1000 m above the ground. When the three additional HONO sources were\nincluded, the photolysis of HONO was the second most important source in the\nOH production rate in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou before 10:00 LST with\na maximum of 3.72 ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup> and a corresponding <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub>\ncontribution of 3.06 ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup> in Beijing, whereas the reaction of\nHO<sub>2</sub> + NO (nitric oxide) was dominant after 10:00 LST with a maximum\nof 9.38 ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup> and a corresponding <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> \ncontribution of 7.23 ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup> in Beijing. The whole RO<sub><i>x</i></sub> cycle was accelerated by the\nthree additional HONO sources, especially the <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub>. The daytime\naverage OH production rate was enhanced by 0.67 due to the three additional\nHONO sources; [0.64], due to the <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub>, to 4.32 [3.86] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via\nthe reaction of HO<sub>2</sub>  + NO, and by 0.49 [0.47] to 1.86 [1.86] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the photolysis of HONO. The OH daytime average loss rate\nwas enhanced by 0.58 [0.55] to 2.03 [1.92] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the reaction of\nOH + NO<sub>2</sub>, and by 0.31 [0.28] to 1.78 [1.64] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the\nreaction of OH + CO (carbon monoxide) in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.\nSimilarly, the three additional HONO sources produced an increase of 0.31\n[0.28] (with a corresponding <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> contribution) to\n1.78 [1.64] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the reaction of OH + CO, and 0.10 [0.09] to 0.63 [0.59] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the reaction of CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (methylperoxy\n radical) + NO in the daytime average HO<sub>2</sub> production rate, and 0.67 [0.61] to 4.32\n[4.27] ppb h<sup>\u22121</sup>, via the reaction of HO<sub>2</sub>  + NO in the daytime\naverage HO<sub>2</sub> loss rate in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The above\nresults suggest that the <i>P</i><sub>unknown</sub> considerably enhanced the RO<sub><i>x</i></sub>\nconcentrations and accelerated RO<sub><i>x</i></sub> cycles in the coastal regions of\nChina, and could produce significant increases in concentrations of\ninorganic aerosols and secondary organic aerosols and further aggravate haze\nevents in these regions.",

A. Hoshyaripour, M. Hort, and B. Langmann<br /><br />It has been shown that volcanic ash fertilizes the Fe-limited areas of the\nsurface ocean through releasing soluble iron. As ash iron is mostly insoluble\nupon the eruption, it is hypothesized that heterogeneous in-plume and\nin-cloud processing of the ash promote the iron solubilization. Direct\nevidences concerning such processes are, however, lacking. In this study, a\n1-D numerical model is developed to simulate the physicochemical interactions\nof the gas\u2013ash\u2013aerosol in volcanic eruption plumes focusing on the iron\nmobilization processes at temperatures between 600 and 0 \u00b0C. Results\nshow that sulfuric acid and water vapor condense at ~ 150\nand ~ 50 \u00b0C on the ash surface, respectively. This liquid\nphase then efficiently scavenges the surrounding gases (> 95 % of HCl,\n3\u201320 % of SO<sub>2</sub> and 12\u201362 % of HF) forming an extremely acidic\ncoating at the ash surface. The low pH conditions of the aqueous film promote\nacid-mediated dissolution of the Fe-bearing phases present in the ash\nmaterial. We estimate that 0.1\u201333 % of the total iron available at the\nash surface is dissolved in the aqueous phase before the freezing point is\nreached. The efficiency of dissolution is controlled by the halogen content\nof the erupted gas as well as the mineralogy of the iron at ash surface:\nelevated halogen concentrations and presence of Fe<sup>2+</sup>-carrying phases\nlead to the highest dissolution efficiency.

First,\nWRF-Chem control simulations, based on the US Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) 2005 National Emissions Inventories (NEI05), are conducted to\nevaluate model performance. Compared with surface observations of hourly\nozone, CO, NO<sub><i>X</i></sub>, and wind fields, the control simulations reproduce\nobserved variability well. Simulated [O<sub>3</sub>] are comparable with the\nprevious studies in this region. Next, the relative contribution of SoCal\nand Arizona local anthropogenic emissions (AZ) to ozone exceedances within\nthe Phoenix metropolitan area is investigated via a trio of sensitivity\nsimulations: (1) SoCal emissions are excluded, with all other emissions as\nin Control; (2) AZ emissions are excluded with all other emissions as in\nControl; and (3) SoCal and AZ emissions are excluded (i.e., all\nanthropogenic emissions are eliminated) to account only for Biogenic\nemissions and lateral boundary inflow (BILB). Based on the USEPA NEI05,\nresults for the selected events indicate the impacts of AZ emissions are\ndominant on daily maximum 8 h average (DMA8) [O<sub>3</sub>] in Phoenix.

R. Kolesar, C. Chen, D. Johnson, and C. D. Cappa<br /><br />The thermally induced evaporation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has\nbeen characterized for SOA formed from the dark ozonolysis of &alpha;-pinene   at initial mass concentrations ranging from 1 to 800 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>. Temperature-dependent particle size distributions were\nmeasured using a thermodenuder and the resulting mass thermograms were\ncompared between the SOA formed at the various SOA mass concentrations.\nNegligible differences were observed between the mass thermograms for SOA\nconcentrations < 300 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>. At higher SOA\nconcentrations, the observed mass thermograms indicated the SOA was actually\nslightly less volatile than the SOA at lower concentrations;  this is likely\nan artifact due to either saturation of the gas phase or to\nrecondensation during cooling. The thermograms observed when the SOA was\nformed at high concentrations (> 380 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>) and\nthen rapidly isothermally diluted to low concentrations (1\u201320 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>) were identical to those for the SOA that was initially formed\nat low concentrations. The experimental results were compared to a kinetic\nmodel that simulates particle evaporation upon heating in a thermodenuder\nfor a given input volatility distribution and particle composition. Three\ncases were considered: (1) the SOA was composed of semi-volatile monomer\nspecies with a volatility distribution based on that derived previously from\nconsideration of SOA growth experiments;  (2) the initial SOA was composed\nalmost entirely of non-volatile dimers that decompose upon heating into\ntheir semi-volatile monomer units, which can then evaporate;  and (3) where a\nvolatility distribution was derived by fitting the model to the observed\nmass thermograms. It was found that good agreement is obtained between model\npredictions and the observations when the particle composition is\ndominated by either compounds of low volatility or by dimers. These same models\nwere used to simulate isothermal evaporation of the SOA and were found to be\nbroadly consistent with literature observations that indicate that SOA\nevaporation occurs with multiple timescales. The use of the semi-volatile\nmonomer volatility distribution fails to reproduce the observed evaporation.\nThe presence of dimers and larger oligomers in secondary organic aerosol\nformed from products of the reaction of \u03b1-pinene and O<sub>3</sub> has\nbeen well established in laboratory studies. However, the timescale and\nrelative importance of the formation of oligomers or low-volatility\ncompounds in the growth and evaporation of SOA has been debated. This study\nprovides further support that low-volatility compounds and oligomers are\nformed in \u03b1-pinene + O<sub>3</sub> in high abundances and suggests that\ntheir formation occurs rapidly upon particle formation.",

In contrast, a similar correlation with sub-2.5 \u03bcm aerosol volume\nis weaker. The C : N atomic ratio inferred from field measurements of\nPM<sub>2.5</sub> and particulate organic nitrate is 34 : 1. Calculations constrained\nby the observations indicate that both condensation of gas-phase nitrates\nand heterogeneous reactions of NO<sub>3</sub> / N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> are responsible for\nintroducing organic nitrate functionality into the aerosol and that the\nsource molecules are alkanes. Extrapolating the results to urban aerosol\nsuggests organic nitrate production from alkanes may be a major secondary\norganic aerosol source.",

Here we use atmospheric OCS to evaluate the gross primary\nproduction (GPP) of three dynamic global vegetation models (Lund\u2013Potsdam\u2013Jena, LPJ; National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research \u2013 Community Land Model 4,\nNCAR-CLM4; and Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems, ORCHIDEE). Vegetation uptake of OCS is modeled as a linear function of\nGPP and leaf relative uptake (LRU), the ratio of OCS to CO<sub>2</sub> deposition\nvelocities of plants. New parameterizations for the non-photosynthetic sinks\n(oxic soils, atmospheric oxidation) and biogenic sources (oceans and anoxic\nsoils) of OCS are also provided. Despite new large oceanic emissions, global\nOCS budgets created with each vegetation model show exceeding sinks by\nseveral hundred Gg S yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. An inversion of the surface fluxes\n(optimization of a global scalar which accounts for flux uncertainties) led\nto balanced OCS global budgets, as atmospheric measurements suggest, mainly\nby drastic reduction (up to \u221250 %) in soil and vegetation uptakes.\n<br><br>\nThe amplitude of variations in atmospheric OCS mixing ratios is mainly\ndictated by the vegetation sink over the Northern Hemisphere. This allows\nfor bias recognition in the GPP representations of the three selected\nmodels. The main bias patterns are (i) the terrestrial GPP of ORCHIDEE at high\nnorthern latitudes is currently overestimated, (ii) the seasonal variations\nof the GPP are out of phase in the NCAR-CLM4 model, showing a maximum carbon\nuptake too early in spring in the northernmost ecosystems, (iii) the overall\namplitude of the seasonal variations of GPP in NCAR-CLM4 is too small, and\n(iv) for the LPJ model, the GPP is slightly out of phase for the northernmost\necosystems and the respiration fluxes might be too large in summer in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. These results rely on the robustness of the OCS\nmodeling framework and, in particular, the choice of the LRU values (assumed\nconstant in time) and the parameterization of soil OCS uptake with small\nseasonal variations. Refined optimization with regional-scale and seasonally\nvarying coefficients might help to test some of these hypothesis.",

McLandress, T. G. Shepherd, A. I. Jonsson, T. von Clarmann, and B.

The two\nnadir-sounding records need not be overlapping so long as the limb-sounding\nrecord bridges between them. The method is applied to global-mean\nstratospheric temperatures from the NOAA Climate Data Records based on the\nStratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A\n(AMSU), extending the SSU record forward in time to yield a continuous data\nset from 1979 to present, and providing a simple framework for extending the\nSSU record into the future using AMSU. SSU and AMSU are bridged using\ntemperature measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive\nAtmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), which is of high enough vertical resolution to\naccurately represent the weighting functions of both SSU and AMSU. For this\napplication, a purely statistical approach is not viable since the different\nnadir channels are not sufficiently linearly independent, statistically\nspeaking. The near-global-mean linear temperature trends for extended SSU\nfor 1980\u20132012 are \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.13, \u22120.71 \u00b1 0.15 and\n\u22120.80 \u00b1 0.17 K decade<sup>\u22121</sup> (95 % confidence) for channels 1, 2 and 3,\nrespectively.

Hodzic, S. Madronich, P. S. Kasibhatla, G. Tyndall, B. Aumont, J. L. Jimenez, J. Lee-Taylor, and J. Orlando<br /><br />This study presents the first modeling estimates of the potential effect of\ngas- and particle-phase organic photolysis reactions on the formation and\nlifetime of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Typically only photolysis of\nsmaller organic molecules (e.g., formaldehyde) for which explicit data exist\nis included in chemistry\u2013climate models. Here, we specifically examine the\nphotolysis of larger molecules that actively partition between the gas and\nparticle phases. The chemical mechanism generator GECKO-A is used to\nexplicitly model SOA formation from \u03b1-pinene, toluene, and C<sub>12</sub>\nand C<sub>16</sub> n-alkane reactions with OH at low and high NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>.\nSimulations are conducted for typical mid-latitude conditions and a solar\nzenith angle of 45\u00b0 (permanent daylight). The results show that\nafter 4 days of chemical aging under those conditions (equivalent to\n8 days in the summer mid-latitudes), gas-phase photolysis leads to a\nmoderate decrease in SOA yields, i.e., ~15 % (low NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) to\n~45 % (high NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) for \u03b1-pinene, ~15 % for toluene, ~25 % for C<sub>12</sub> n-alkane, and\n~10 % for C<sub>16</sub> n-alkane. The small effect of gas-phase\nphotolysis on low-volatility n-alkanes such as C<sub>16</sub> n-alkane is due to the\nrapid partitioning of early-generation products to the particle phase, where\nthey are protected from gas-phase photolysis. Minor changes are found in the\nvolatility distribution of organic products and in oxygen to carbon ratios.\nThe decrease in SOA mass is increasingly more important after a day of\nchemical processing, suggesting that most laboratory experiments are likely\ntoo short to quantify the effect of gas-phase photolysis on SOA yields. Our\nresults also suggest that many molecules containing chromophores are\npreferentially partitioned into the particle phase before they can be\nphotolyzed in the gas phase. Given the growing experimental evidence that\nthese molecules can undergo in-particle photolysis, we performed sensitivity\nsimulations using an empirically estimated SOA photolysis rate of\n<i>J</i><sub>SOA</sub> = 4 \u00d7 10<sup>&minus;4</sup> <i>J</i><sub>NO<sub>2</sub></sub>. Modeling results indicate that\nthis photolytic loss rate would decrease SOA mass by 40\u201360 % for most\nspecies after 10 days of equivalent atmospheric aging at mid-latitudes in\nthe summer. It should be noted that in our simulations we do not consider\nin-particle or aqueous-phase reactions which could modify the chemical\ncomposition of the particle and thus the quantity of photolabile species. The\natmospheric implications of our results are significant for both the SOA\nglobal distribution and lifetime. GEOS-Chem global model results suggest\nthat particle-phase photolytic reactions could be an important loss process\nfor SOA in the atmosphere, removing aerosols from the troposphere on\ntimescales of less than 7 days that are comparable to wet deposition.",

For the\nforest floor, HONO was found to predominantly deposit, whereas for the clearing, net\ndeposition dominated only during nighttime and net\nemissions were observed during daytime. For selected days, net fluxes of\nHONO were calculated from the measured profiles using the aerodynamic\ngradient method. The emission fluxes were in the range of 0.02 to 0.07 nmol m<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> and thus were in the lower range of previous\nobservations. These fluxes were compared to the strengths of postulated HONO\nsources. Laboratory measurements of different soil samples from both sites\nrevealed an upper limit for soil biogenic HONO emission fluxes of 0.025 nmol m<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>.

While the first\ntwo approaches based on empirical HONO formation rates yielded values in the\nsame order of magnitude as the estimated fluxes, the third approach based on\navailable kinetic data of the postulated pathway failed to produce\nnoticeable amounts of HONO. Estimates based on reported cross sections of\nadsorbed HNO<sub>3</sub> indicate that the lifetime of adsorbed HNO<sub>3</sub> was\nonly about 15 min, which would imply a substantial renoxification. Although\nthe photolysis of HNO<sub>3</sub> was significantly enhanced at the surface, the\nsubsequent light-induced conversion of the photolysis product NO<sub>2</sub> did\nnot produce considerable amounts of HONO. Consequently, this reaction might\noccur via an alternative mechanism.\n<br><br>\nBy explicitly calculating HONO formation based on available kinetic data\nand simple parameterizations, we showed that (a) for low NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> the light-induced conversion of NO<sub>2</sub> on humic acids is already light saturated\nby the early morning, (b) HONO formation from photolysis of adsorbed HNO<sub>3</sub>\nappears to proceed via an alternative mechanism and (c) estimates of HONO\nemissions from soil are very sensitive to mass transfer and acidic soils do\nnot necessarily favour HONO emissions.",

In the simulated non-precipitating\n  warm-phase cloud, aerosol mass is incorporated into cloud droplets by activation scavenging and\n  released back to the atmosphere upon cloud\n  droplet evaporation. In the mixed-phase cloud, a first cycle comprises cloud droplet\n  activation and evaporation via the Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen (WBF) process.

The aerosol hygroscopicity tended to\nbe at minimum just before the noon and at maximum in the afternoon, which was\nvery likely due to the higher sulfate-to-organic ratios and higher degree of\noxidation of the organic material during the afternoon.

Kr\u00e4mer<br /><br />Dehydration in the Antarctic winter stratosphere is a well-known phenomenon\nthat is annually observed by satellites and occasionally observed by\nballoon-borne measurements. However, in situ measurements of dehydrated air\nmasses in the Antarctic vortex are very rare. Here, we present detailed\nobservations with the in situ and GLORIA remote sensing instrument payload\naboard the German aircraft HALO. Strongly dehydrated air masses down to\n1.6 ppmv of water vapor were observed as far north as 47\u00b0 S in\nan altitude between 12 and 13 km in the lowermost stratosphere. The\ndehydration can be traced back to individual ice formation events above the\nAntarctic Peninsula and Plateau, where ice crystals sedimented out and water\nvapor was irreversibly removed. Within these dehydrated stratospheric air\nmasses, filaments of moister air reaching down to the tropopause are detected\nwith the high-resolution limb sounder, GLORIA. Furthermore, dehydrated air\nmasses are observed with GLORIA in the Antarctic lowermost stratosphere down\nto 7 km. With the help of a backward trajectory analysis, a midlatitude\norigin of the moist filaments in the vortex can be identified, while the dry\nair masses down to 7 km have stratospheric origins. Antarctic\nstratosphere\u2013troposphere exchange (STE) and transport of dehydrated air\nmasses into the troposphere are investigated. Further, it is shown that the\nexchange process can be attributed to several successive Rossby wave events\nin combination with an isentropic exchange of air masses across the thermal\ntropopause. The transport into the troposphere is caused by air masses that\nare detached from the potential vorticity (PV) structure by Rossby wave breaking events and\nsubsequently transported diabatically across the dynamical tropopause. Once\ntransported to the troposphere, air masses with stratospheric origin can\nreach near-surface levels within several days.",

Niemeier and C. Timmreck<br /><br />The injection of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) into the stratosphere to form\nan artificial stratospheric aerosol layer is discussed as an option for solar\nradiation management. The related reduction of radiative forcing depends upon\nthe injected amount of sulfur dioxide, but aerosol model studies indicate\na decrease in forcing efficiency with increasing injection rate. None of\nthese studies, however, consider injection rates greater than\n20 Tg(S) yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>. But this would be necessary to counteract the\nstrong anthropogenic forcing expected if \"business as usual\" emission\nconditions continue throughout this century. To understand the effects of the\ninjection of larger amounts of SO<sub>2</sub>, we have calculated the effects of\nSO<sub>2</sub> injections up to 100 Tg(S) yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>. We estimate the\nreliability of our results through consideration of various injection\nstrategies and from comparison with results obtained from other models. Our\ncalculations show that the efficiency of such a geoengineering method,\nexpressed as the ratio between sulfate aerosol forcing and injection rate,\ndecays exponentially. This result implies that the sulfate solar radiation\nmanagement strategy required to keep temperatures constant at that\nanticipated for 2020, while maintaining business as usual conditions,\nwould require atmospheric injections of approximately\n45 Tg(S) yr<sup>&minus;1</sup> (\u00b115 % or 7 Tg(S) yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) at\na height corresponding to 60 hPa. This emission is equivalent to 5 to\n7 times the Mt. Pinatubo eruption each year.",

Our\ntwo recent studies have shown that biodiesel fuel composition has a\nsignificant impact on primary particulate matter emissions. It was also shown\nthat particulate matter caused by biodiesels was substantially different from\nthe emissions due to petroleum diesel. Emissions appeared to have higher\noxidative potential with the increase in oxygen content and decrease of\ncarbon chain length and unsaturation levels of fuel molecules. Overall, both\nstudies concluded that chemical composition of biodiesel is more important\nthan its physical properties in controlling exhaust particle emissions. This\nsuggests that the atmospheric aging processes, including secondary organic\naerosol formation, of emissions from different fuels will be different as\nwell. In this study, measurements were conducted on a modern common-rail\ndiesel engine.

Yu<br /><br />In China, a rapid increase in passenger vehicles has led to the growing\nconcern of vehicle exhaust as an important source of anthropogenic secondary\norganic aerosol (SOA) in megacities hard hit by haze. In this study, the SOA\nformation of emissions from two idling light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs)\n(Euro 1 and Euro 4) operated in China was investigated in a 30 m<sup>3</sup> smog\nchamber. Five photo-oxidation experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C\nwith relative humidity at around 50 %. After aging at an OH exposure of\n5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>\u22123</sup> h, the formed SOA was 12\u2013259\ntimes as high as primary organic aerosol (POA). The SOA production factors\n(PF) were 0.001\u20130.044 g kg<sup>\u22121</sup> fuel, comparable with those from the\nprevious studies at comparable OH exposure. This quite lower OH exposure than\nthat in typical atmospheric conditions might however lead to the\nunderestimation of the SOA formation potential from LDGVs. Effective SOA\nyields in this study were well fit by a one-product gas-particle partitioning\nmodel but quite lower than those of a previous study investigating SOA\nformation from three idling passenger vehicles (Euro 2\u20134). Traditional\nsingle-ring aromatic precursors and naphthalene could explain 51\u201390 % of\nthe formed SOA. Unspeciated species such as branched and cyclic alkanes might\nbe the possible precursors for the unexplained SOA. A high-resolution\ntime-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer was used to characterize the\nchemical composition of SOA. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>43</sub> (ratio of\n<i>m/z</i> 43, mostly C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, to the total signal in mass spectrum)\nand <i>f</i><sub>44</sub> (mostly CO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) of the gasoline vehicle exhaust SOA is\nsimilar to the ambient semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA).

E. Nicholls<br /><br />Recent cloud-resolving numerical modeling results suggest that radiative\nforcing causes accelerated rates of tropical cyclogenesis and early\nintensification. Furthermore, observational studies of tropical cyclones have\nfound that oscillations of the cloud canopy areal extent often occur that are\nclearly related to the solar diurnal cycle. A theory is put forward to\nexplain these findings. The primary mechanism that seems responsible can be\nconsidered a refinement of the mechanism proposed by Gray and Jacobson (1977)\nto explain diurnal variations of oceanic tropical deep cumulus convection. It\nis hypothesized that differential radiative cooling or heating between a\nrelatively cloud-free environment and a developing tropical disturbance\ngenerates circulations that can have very significant influences on\nconvective activity in the core of the system. It is further suggested that\nthere are benefits to understanding this mechanism by viewing it in terms of\nthe lateral propagation of thermally driven gravity wave circulations, also\nknown as buoyancy bores. Numerical model experiments indicate that mean\nenvironmental radiative cooling outside the cloud system is playing an\nimportant role in causing a significant horizontal differential radiative\nforcing and accelerating the rate of tropical cyclogenesis. As an expansive\nstratiform cloud layer forms aloft within a developing system the mean\nlow-level radiative cooling is reduced, while at mid levels small warming\noccurs. During the daytime there is not a very large differential radiative\nforcing between the environment and the cloud system, but at nighttime when\nthere is strong radiative clear-sky cooling of the environment it becomes\nsignificant. Thermally driven circulations develop, characterized by\nrelatively weak subsidence in the environment but much stronger upward motion\nin the cloud system. This upward motion leads to a cooling tendency and\nincreased relative humidity. The increased relative humidity at night appears\nto be a major factor in enhancing convective activity, thereby leading in the\nmean to an increased rate of genesis. It is postulated that the increased\nupward motion and relative humidity that occur throughout a deep layer aid\nboth in the triggering of convection and in providing a more favorable local\nenvironment at mid levels for maintenance of buoyancy in convective cells due\nto a reduction of the detrimental effects of dry air entrainment.\nAdditionally, the day/night modulations of the environmental radiative\nforcing appear to play a major role in the diurnal cycles of convective\nactivity in the cloud system. It is shown that the upward velocity tendencies\nin the system core produced by the radiative forcing are extremely weak when\ncompared to those produced by latent heat release in convective towers, but\nnevertheless over the course of a night they appear capable of significantly\ninfluencing convective activity.",

It should be noted that apart from the YRD, the\narea around Mt. Lushan has become the most significant contributor to the\nsolubility of most trace elements.

Many inorganic salts have well-defined\ndeliquescence and efflorescence points at which they take up and lose water,\nrespectively. Field measurements have shown that atmospheric aerosols are\nnot typically pure inorganic salt, instead, they often also contain organic\nspecies. There is ample evidence from laboratory studies that suggests that\nmixed particles exist in a phase-separated state, with an aqueous inorganic\ncore and organic shell. Although phase separation has not been measured in\nsitu, there is no reason it would not also take place in the atmosphere.\nHere, we investigate the deliquescence and efflorescence points, phase\nseparation and ability to exchange gas-phase components of mixed organic and\ninorganic aerosol using a flow tube coupled with FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy. Ammonium\nsulfate aerosol mixed with organic polyols with different O : C ratios,\nincluding 1,4-butanediol, glycerol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2-hexanediol, and\n1,5-pentanediol have been investigated.

Some results of this study tend to be in agreement with\nprevious microscopy experiments, but others, such as phase separation\nproperties of 1,2,6-hexanetriol, do not agree with previous work. Because\nthe particles studied in this experiment are of a smaller size than those\nused in microscopy studies, the discrepancies found could be a size-related\neffect.",

Sommariva, O. Wild, and M. L. Williams<br /><br />Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous\nin the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful\nto human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas.\nIt is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very\noxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the\nreduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation\nimpacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country\nscale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background\nozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation\nthat the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important\nin integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines\ncurrent understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at\nglobal to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view\nthat knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality\nand climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there\nremain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface\ntrends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone\u2013climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to\ntreat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an\nemphasis on the hemispheric scales. New observational opportunities are\noffered both by satellites and small sensors that bridge the scales.",

Shaw, Z. Zhang, A. Gold, and J. D. Surratt<br /><br />A suite of offline and real-time gas- and particle-phase measurements was\ndeployed at Look Rock, Tennessee (TN), during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and\nAerosol Study (SOAS) to examine the effects of anthropogenic emissions on\nisoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. High- and\nlow-time-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples were collected for analysis of known\ntracer compounds in isoprene-derived SOA by gas chromatography/electron\nionization-mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) and ultra performance liquid\nchromatography/diode array detection-electrospray ionization-high-resolution\nquadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/DAD-ESI-HR-QTOFMS). Source\napportionment of the organic aerosol (OA) was determined by positive matrix\nfactorization (PMF) analysis of mass spectrometric data acquired on an\nAerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Campaign average mass\nconcentrations of the sum of quantified isoprene-derived SOA tracers\ncontributed to ~ 9 % (up to 28 %) of the total OA mass,\nwith isoprene-epoxydiol (IEPOX) chemistry accounting for ~ 97 % of the quantified tracers. PMF analysis resolved a factor with a\nprofile similar to the IEPOX-OA factor resolved in an Atlanta study and was\ntherefore designated IEPOX-OA. This factor was strongly correlated\n(<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.7) with 2-methyltetrols, C<sub>5</sub>-alkene triols,\nIEPOX-derived organosulfates, and dimers of organosulfates, confirming the\nrole of IEPOX chemistry as the source. On average, IEPOX-derived SOA tracer\nmass was ~ 26 % (up to 49 %) of the IEPOX-OA factor mass,\nwhich accounted for 32 % of the total OA. A low-volatility oxygenated\norganic aerosol (LV-OOA) and an oxidized factor with a profile similar to\n91Fac observed in areas where emissions are biogenic-dominated were also\nresolved by PMF analysis, whereas no primary organic aerosol (POA) sources\ncould be resolved. These findings were consistent with low levels of primary\npollutants, such as nitric oxide (NO ~ 0.03 ppb), carbon\nmonoxide (CO ~ 116 ppb), and black carbon (BC ~ 0.2 \u03bcg m<sup>&minus;3</sup>). Particle-phase sulfate is fairly correlated\n(<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> ~ 0.3) with both methacrylic acid epoxide\n(MAE)/hydroxymethyl-methyl-\u03b1-lactone (HMML)- (henceforth called\nmethacrolein (MACR)-derived SOA tracers) and IEPOX-derived SOA tracers, and\nmore strongly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> ~ 0.6) with the IEPOX-OA\nfactor, in sum suggesting an important role of sulfate in isoprene SOA\nformation. Moderate correlation between the MACR-derived SOA tracer\n2-methylglyceric acid with sum of reactive and reservoir nitrogen oxides\n(NO<sub><i>y</i></sub>; <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.38) and nitrate (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.45) indicates the\npotential influence of anthropogenic emissions through long-range transport.\nDespite the lack of a clear association of IEPOX-OA with locally estimated\naerosol acidity and liquid water content (LWC), box model calculations of\nIEPOX uptake using the simpleGAMMA model, accounting for the role of acidity\nand aerosol water, predicted the abundance of the IEPOX-derived SOA tracers\n2-methyltetrols and the corresponding sulfates with good accuracy (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>\n~ 0.5 and ~ 0.7, respectively). The modeling and\ndata combined suggest an anthropogenic influence on isoprene-derived SOA\nformation through acid-catalyzed heterogeneous chemistry of IEPOX in the\nsoutheastern US. However, it appears that this process was not limited by\naerosol acidity or LWC at Look Rock during SOAS. Future studies should\nfurther explore the extent to which acidity and LWC as well as aerosol\nviscosity and morphology becomes a limiting factor of IEPOX-derived SOA, and\ntheir modulation by anthropogenic emissions.",

Andreae<br /><br />In this study we describe the hygroscopic properties of accumulation- and\ncoarse-mode aerosol particles sampled at the Zotino Tall Tower Observatory\n(ZOTTO) in central Siberia (61\u00b0 N, 89\u00b0 E) from 16 to 21\nJune 2013. The hygroscopic growth measurements were supplemented with\nchemical analyses of the samples, including inorganic ions and\norganic/elemental carbon. In addition, the microstructure and chemical\ncompositions of aerosol particles were analyzed by x-ray micro-spectroscopy\n(STXM-NEXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A mass closure\nanalysis indicates that organic carbon accounted for 61 and 38 % of\nparticulate matter (PM) in the accumulation mode and coarse mode,\nrespectively. The water-soluble fraction of organic matter was estimated to\nbe 52 and 8 % of PM in these modes. Sulfate, predominantly in the form of\nammoniated sulfate, was the dominant inorganic component in both size modes:\n~ 34 % in the accumulation mode vs. ~ 47 % in the coarse\nmode.\n<br><br>\nThe hygroscopic growth measurements were conducted with a filter-based\ndifferential hygroscopicity analyzer (FDHA) over the range of 5\u201399.4 %\nRH in the hydration and dehydration operation modes. The FDHA study indicates\nthat both accumulation and coarse modes exhibit pronounced water uptake\napproximately at the same relative humidity (RH), starting at\n~ 70 %, while efflorescence occurred at different humidities, i.e.,\nat ~ 35 % RH for submicron particles vs. ~ 50 % RH for\nsupermicron particles. This ~ 15 % RH difference was attributed to\nhigher content of organic material in the submicron particles, which\nsuppresses water release in the dehydration experiments.\n<br><br>\nThe kappa mass interaction model (KIM) was applied to characterize and\nparameterize non-ideal solution behavior and concentration-dependent water\nuptake by atmospheric aerosol samples in the 5\u201399.4 % RH range. Based on\nKIM, the volume-based hygroscopicity parameter, &kappa;<sub>v</sub>, was\ncalculated. The &kappa;<sub>v,ws</sub> value related to the water-soluble\n(ws) fraction was estimated to be ~ 0.15 for the accumulation mode\nand ~ 0.36 for the coarse mode, respectively. The obtained\n&kappa;<sub>v,ws</sub> for the accumulation mode is in good agreement with\nearlier data reported for remote sites in the Amazon rain forest (&kappa;<sub>v</sub> &approx; 0.15) and a Colorado mountain forest \n(&kappa;<sub>v</sub> &approx; 0.16 ).\n<br><br>\nWe used the Zdanovskii\u2013Stokes\u2013Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule to predict the\nchemical composition dependent hygroscopicity, &kappa;<sub>v,p</sub>. The\nobtained &kappa;<sub>v,p</sub> values overestimate the experimental\nFDHA-KIM-derived &kappa;<sub>v,ws</sub> by factors of 1.8 and 1.5 for the\naccumulation and coarse modes, respectively. This divergence can be explained\nby incomplete dissolution of the hygroscopic inorganic compounds resulting\nfrom kinetic limitations due to a sparingly soluble organic coating. The TEM\nand STXM-NEXAFS results indicate that aged submicron (> 300 nm)\nand supermicron aerosol particles possess core\u2013shell structures with an\ninorganic core, and are enriched in organic carbon at the mixed particle\nsurface. The direct FDHA kinetic studies provide a bulk diffusion coefficient\nof water of ~ 10<sup>&minus;12</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> indicating a semi-solid\nstate of the organic-rich phase leading to kinetic limitations of water\nuptake and release during hydration and dehydration cycles.\n<br><br>\nOverall, the present ZOTTO data set, obtained in the growing season, has\nrevealed a strong influence of organic carbon on the hygroscopic properties\nof the ambient aerosols. The sparingly soluble organic coating controls\nhygroscopic growth, phase transitions, and microstructural rearrangement\nprocesses. The observed kinetic limitations can strongly influence the\noutcome of experiments performed on multi-second timescales, such as the\ncommonly applied HTDMA (Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer)\nand CCNC (Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter) measurements.",

Andela, J. W. Kaiser, G. R. van der Werf, and M. J. Wooster<br /><br />Accurate near real time fire emissions estimates are required for air\nquality forecasts. To date, most approaches are based on satellite-derived\nestimates of fire radiative power (FRP), which can be converted to fire\nradiative energy (FRE) which is directly related to fire emissions.\nUncertainties in these FRE estimates are often substantial. This is for a\nlarge part because the most often used low-Earth orbit satellite-based\ninstruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) have a relatively poor sampling of the usually pronounced fire\ndiurnal cycle. In this paper we explore the spatial variation of this fire\ndiurnal cycle and its drivers using data from the geostationary Meteosat\nSpinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). In addition, we\nsampled data from the SEVIRI instrument at MODIS detection opportunities to\ndevelop two approaches to estimate hourly FRE based on MODIS active fire\ndetections. The first approach ignored the fire diurnal cycle, assuming\npersistent fire activity between two MODIS observations, while the second\napproach combined knowledge on the climatology of the fire diurnal cycle\nwith active fire detections to estimate hourly FRE. The full SEVIRI\ntime series, providing full coverage of the fire diurnal cycle, were used to\nevaluate the results. Our study period comprised of 3 years\n(2010\u20132012), and we focused on Africa and the Mediterranean basin to avoid\nthe use of potentially lower quality SEVIRI data obtained at very far\noff-nadir view angles. We found that the fire diurnal cycle varies\nsubstantially over the study region, and depends on both fuel and weather\nconditions. For example, more \"intense\" fires characterized by a fire\ndiurnal cycle with high peak fire activity, long duration over the day, and\nwith nighttime fire activity are most common in areas of large fire size\n(i.e., large burned area per fire event). These areas are most prevalent in\nrelatively arid regions. Ignoring the fire diurnal cycle generally resulted\nin an overestimation of FRE, while including information on the climatology\nof the fire diurnal cycle improved FRE estimates. The approach based on\nknowledge of the climatology of the fire diurnal cycle also improved\ndistribution of FRE over the day, although only when aggregating model\nresults to coarser spatial and/or temporal scale good correlation was found\nwith the full SEVIRI hourly reference data set. We recommend the use of\nregionally varying fire diurnal cycle information within the Global Fire\nAssimilation System (GFAS) used in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring\nServices, which will improve FRE estimates and may allow for further\nreconciliation of biomass burning emission estimates from different\ninventories.",

Shen, X. Ding, Q.-F. He, Z.-Y. Cong, Q.-Q. Yu, and X.-M. Wang<br /><br />Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) affects the earth's radiation balance and\nglobal climate. High-elevation areas are sensitive to global climate change.\nHowever, at present, SOA origins and seasonal variations are understudied in\nremote high-elevation areas. In this study, particulate samples were\ncollected from July 2012 to July 2013 at the remote Nam Co (NC) site,\nCentral Tibetan Plateau and analyzed for SOA tracers from biogenic\n(isoprene, monoterpenes and \u03b2-caryophyllene) and anthropogenic\n(aromatics) precursors. Among these compounds, isoprene SOA (SOA<sub>I</sub>)\ntracers represented the majority (26.6 \u00b1 44.2 ng m<sup>&minus;3</sup>), followed\nby monoterpene SOA (SOA<sub>M</sub>) tracers (0.97 \u00b1 0.57 ng m<sup>&minus;3</sup>),\naromatic SOA (SOA<sub>A</sub>) tracer (2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid, DHOPA,\n0.25 \u00b1 0.18 ng m<sup>&minus;3</sup>) and \u03b2-caryophyllene SOA tracer (&beta;-caryophyllenic acid, 0.09 \u00b1 0.10 ng m<sup>&minus;3</sup>). SOA<sub>I</sub> tracers\nexhibited high concentrations in the summer and low levels in the winter.\nThe similar temperature dependence of SOA<sub>I</sub> tracers and isoprene\nemission suggested that the seasonal variation of SOA<sub>I</sub> tracers at the\nNC site was mainly influenced by the isoprene emission. The ratio of\nhigh-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> to low-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> products of SOA<sub>I</sub> (2-methylglyceric acid to\n2-methyltetrols) was highest in the winter and lowest in the summer,\ndue to the influence of temperature and relative humidity. The seasonal\nvariation of SOA<sub>M</sub> tracers was impacted by monoterpenes emission and\ngas-particle partitioning. During the summer to the fall, temperature effect\non partitioning was the dominant process influencing SOA<sub>M</sub> tracers'\nvariation; while the temperature effect on emission was the dominant process\ninfluencing SOA<sub>M</sub> tracers' variation during the winter to the spring.\nSOA<sub>M</sub> tracer levels did not elevate with increased temperature in the\nsummer, probably resulting from the counteraction of temperature effects on\nemission and partitioning. The concentrations of DHOPA were 1\u20132 orders of\nmagnitude lower than those reported in the urban regions of the world. Due\nto the transport of air pollutants from the adjacent Bangladesh and\nnortheastern India, DHOPA presented relatively higher levels in the summer.\nIn the winter when air masses mainly came from northwestern India, mass\nfractions of DHOPA in total tracers increased, although its concentrations\ndeclined. The SOA-tracer method was applied to estimate secondary organic\ncarbon (SOC) from these four precursors. The annual average of SOC was 0.22 \u00b1 0.29 \u03bcgC m<sup>\u22123</sup>,\nwith the biogenic SOC (sum of isoprene,\nmonoterpenes and \u03b2-caryophyllene) accounting for 75 %. In the\nsummer, isoprene was the major precursor with its SOC contributions of\n81 %. In the winter when the emission of biogenic precursors largely\ndropped, the contributions of aromatic SOC increased. Our study implies that\nanthropogenic pollutants emitted in the Indian subcontinent could be\ntransported to the TP and have an impact on SOC over the remote NC.",

Natural sources (NAT) and six categories of\nanthropogenic mercury sources (ANTH) including cement production (CEM),\ndomestic life (DOM), industrial boilers (IND), metal production (MET),\ncoal-fired power plants (PP) and traffic (TRA) were considered for source\napportionment. NAT were responsible for 36.6 % of annual averaged GEM\nconcentration, which was regarded as the most important source for GEM in\nspite of obvious seasonal variation. Among ANTH, the influence of MET and PP\non GEM were most evident especially in winter. ANTH dominated the variations\nof GOM and PBM concentrations with   contributions of 86.7  and 79.1 %,\nrespectively. Among ANTH, IND were the largest contributor for GOM (57.5 %)\nand PBM (34.4 %) so that most mercury deposition came from IND. The effect\nof mercury emitted from out of China was indicated by a > 30 %\ncontribution to GEM concentration and wet deposition. The contributions from\nnine processes \u2013 consisting of emissions (EMIS), gas-phase chemical\nproduction/loss (CHEM), horizontal advection (HADV), vertical advection\n(ZADV), horizontal advection (HDIF), vertical diffusion (VDIF), dry\ndeposition (DDEP), cloud processes (CLDS) and aerosol processes (AERO) \u2013 were\ncalculated for process  analysis with their comparison in urban and\nnon-urban regions of the Yangtze River delta (YRD). EMIS and VDIF affected\nsurface GEM and PBM concentrations most and tended to compensate each other\nall the time in both urban and non-urban areas. However, DDEP was the most\nimportant removal process for GOM with 7.3  and 2.9 ng m<sup>\u22123</sup>\nreduced in the surface of urban and non-urban areas, respectively, in 1\nday. The diurnal profile variation of processes revealed the transportation of\nGOM from urban area to non-urban areas and the importance of CHEM/AERO in\nhigher altitudes which partly caused diffusion of GOM downwards to non-urban areas. Most of the anthropogenic mercury was transported and diffused away from\nurban areas by HADV and VDIF and increased mercury concentrations in non-urban\nareas by HADV. Natural emissions only influenced CHEM and AERO more\nsignificantly than anthropogenic. Local emissions in the YRD contributed\n8.5 % more to GEM and ~ 30 % more to GOM and PBM in urban\nareas compared to non-urban areas.",

Herrmann<br /><br />Trace metal characterization of bulk and size-resolved aerosol and cloud\nwater samples were performed during the Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia (HCCT)\ncampaign. Cloud water was collected at the top of Mt. Schm\u00fccke while\naerosol samples were collected at two stations upwind and downwind of Mt.\nSchm\u00fccke. Fourteen trace metals including Ti, V, Fe, Mn, Co, Zn, Ni, Cu,\nAs, Sr, Rb, Pb, Cr, and Se were investigated during four full cloud events\n(FCEs) that fulfilled the conditions of a continuous air mass flow through the\nthree stations. Aerosol particle trace metal concentrations were found to be\nlower than those observed in the same region during previous field\nexperiments but were within a similar range to those observed in other rural\nregions in Europe. Fe and Zn were the most abundant elements with\nconcentration ranges of 0.2\u2013111.6 and\n1.1\u201332.1 ng m<sup>\u22123</sup>,\nrespectively. Fe, Mn, and Ti were mainly found in coarse mode aerosols while\nZn, Pb, and As were mostly found in the fine mode. Correlation and enrichment\nfactor analysis of trace metals revealed that trace metals such as Ti and Rb\nwere mostly of crustal origin while trace metals such as Zn, Pb, As, Cr, Ni,\nV, and Cu were of anthropogenic origin. Trace metals such as Fe and Mn were of\nmixed origins including crustal and combustion sources. Trace metal cloud\nwater concentration decreased from Ti, Mn, Cr, to Co with average\nconcentrations of 9.18, 5.59, 5.54, and 0.46 \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup>,\nrespectively. A non-uniform distribution of soluble Fe, Cu, and Mn was\nobserved across the cloud drop sizes. Soluble Fe and Cu were found mainly in\ncloud droplets with diameters between 16 and 22 \u03bcm, while Mn was\nfound mostly in larger drops greater than 22 \u03bcm. Fe(III) was the\nmain form of soluble Fe especially in the small and larger drops with\nconcentrations ranging from 2.2 to\n37.1 \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup>. In\ncontrast to other studies, Fe(II) was observed mainly in the evening hours,\nimplying its presence was not directly related to photochemical processes.\nAerosol\u2013cloud interaction did not lead to a marked increase in soluble trace\nmetal concentrations; rather it led to differences in the chemical composition of\nthe aerosol due to preferential loss of aerosol particles through physical\nprocesses including cloud drop deposition to vegetative surfaces.",

In this paper we present a year's worth of tracked contrails, from August 2008 to July 2009 in order to\nderive statistically significant mean values.\nThe tracking is performed using the 5 min rapid-scan mode of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second\nGeneration (MSG) satellites. The detection is based on the high spatial resolution of the images provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\non board the Terra satellite (Terra/MODIS), where a contrail detection algorithm (CDA) is applied. The results show the satellite-derived average lifetimes of contrails and\ncontrail-cirrus along with the probability density function (PDF) of other geometric characteristics such as mean coverage, distribution and width. In\ncombination with specifically developed algorithms (RRUMS; Rapid Retrieval of Upwelling irradiance from\nMSG/SEVIRI and COCS (Cirrus Optical properties derived from CALIOP and SEVIRI), explained below) it is possible to derive the radiative  forcing (RF), energy forcing (EF),\noptical thickness (\u03c4) and altitude of the tracked contrails. Mean values here\nretrieved are duration, 1 h; length, 130 km; width, 8 km; altitude, 11.7 km; optical thickness, 0.34.

Sant, R. Posselt, and U.

The additionally introduced drizzle class improves the\nphysical representation of the droplet spectrum and, more importantly,\nimproves the microphysical processes relevant for precipitation formation\ncompared to the standard parameterization. In order to avoid a mismatch of\nthe liquid and ice phase, a prognostic treatment of snow has been\nintroduced too. This has a significant effect on the amount and altitude of\nice clouds, which in turn affects not only the in- and outgoing radiation\nbut also the parameterized collection rates. With the introduction of a\nprognostic precipitation scheme, a more realistic representation of both\nliquid and ice phase large-scale precipitation is achieved compared to a\ndiagnostic treatment. An encouraging finding is that with the prognostic\ntreatment the increase of the liquid water path in response to anthropogenic\naerosols is reduced by about 25 %. Although the total net radiative\nforcing is decreased from &minus;1.3\u00b10.3 to &minus;1.6\u00b10.3 W m<sup>\u22122</sup> from\nthe control to the prognostic model version, the difference is within the\ninterannual variability. Altogether the results suggest that the treatment of\nprecipitation in global circulation models has not only a significant influence on the\nphase of clouds and their conversion rates, but also hints towards uncertainties\nrelated to a prognostic precipitation scheme.",

We simulate this event with the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the\nStratosphere (CLaMS), both with optimized mixing parameters and with no mixing,\ni.e. with transport occurring only along the Lagrangian trajectories.\nThe results are investigated by using tracer\u2013tracer correlations\nand by applying the transformed Eulerian-mean formalism.\nThe CLaMS simulation of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>3</sub>, and in particular of\nthe O<sub>3</sub>\u2013N<sub>2</sub>O tracer correlations with optimized mixing parameters, shows\ngood agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data.\nThe spatial distribution of mixing intensity in CLaMS correlates fairly\nwell with the Eliassen\u2013Palm flux convergence. This correlation illustrates how planetary\nwaves drive mixing. By comparing simulations with and without mixing,\nwe find that after the SSW, poleward transport of air increases, not only across the vortex edge but also across\nthe subtropical transport barrier.\nMoreover, the SSW event, at the same time, accelerates polar descent and tropical ascent of\nthe Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation. The accelerated ascent in the tropics\nand descent at high latitudes first occurs in the upper stratosphere and\nthen propagates downward to the lower stratosphere.\nThis downward propagation takes over 1 month from the potential temperature\nlevel of 1000 to 400 K.",

During the summer 2013\n  Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign in a rural\n  site in the southeastern United States, a suite of instruments\n  including a CCN counter, a thermodenuder (TD), and a high-resolution\n  time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were used to measure\n  CCN activity, aerosol volatility, composition, and oxidation\n  state. Particles were either sampled directly from ambient or\n  through a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS), allowing the\n  investigation of the water-soluble aerosol component. Ambient\n  aerosols exhibited size-dependent composition with larger particles\n  being more hygroscopic. The hygroscopicity of thermally denuded\n  aerosols was similar between ambient and PILS-generated aerosols and\n  showed limited dependence on volatilization. Results of AMS three-factor\n  positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis for the PILS-generated\n  aerosols\n  showed that the most hygroscopic components are most likely the most\n  and the least volatile features of the aerosols. No clear\n  relationship was found between organic hygroscopicity and the\n  oxygen-to-carbon ratio; in fact, isoprene-derived organic aerosols\n  (isoprene-OAs) were found to be the most hygroscopic factor, while at\n  the same time being the least oxidized and likely most volatile of\n  all PMF factors. Considering the diurnal variation of each PMF\n  factor and its associated hygroscopicity, isoprene-OA and more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosols are the prime\n  contributors to hygroscopicity and co-vary with less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosols in a way that induces the observed\n  diurnal invariance in total organic hygroscopicity. Biomass burning\n  organic aerosols contributed little to aerosol\n  hygroscopicity, which is expected since there was little biomass\n  burning activity during the sampling period examined.",

Cui, P. Mao, Y. Zhao, C. P. Nielsen, and J. Zhang<br /><br />China is experiencing severe carbonaceous aerosol pollution driven mainly by\nlarge emissions resulting from intensive use of solid fuels. To gain a\nbetter understanding of the levels and trends of carbonaceous aerosol\nemissions and the resulting ambient concentrations at the national scale, we\nupdate an emission inventory of anthropogenic organic carbon (OC) and\nelemental carbon (EC) and employ existing observational studies to analyze\ncharacteristics of these aerosols including temporal, spatial, and size\ndistributions, and the levels and shares of secondary organic carbon (SOC)\nin total OC. We further use ground observations to test the levels and\ninter-annual trends of the calculated national and provincial emissions of\ncarbonaceous aerosols, and propose possible improvements in emission\nestimation for the future. The national OC emissions are estimated to have\nincreased 29 % from 2000 (2127 Gg) to 2012 (2749 Gg) and EC by 37 %\n(from 1356 to 1857 Gg). The residential, industrial, and transportation\nsectors contributed an estimated 74\u201378, 17\u201321, and 4\u20136 % of the\ntotal emissions of OC, respectively, and 49\u201355, 30\u201334, and 14\u201318 %\nof EC. Updated emission factors (EFs) based on the most recent local field\nmeasurements, particularly for biofuel stoves, led to considerably lower\nemissions of OC compared to previous inventories. Compiling observational\ndata across the country, higher concentrations of OC and EC are found in\nnorthern and inland cities, while higher OC / EC ratios are found in southern\nsites, due to the joint effects of primary emissions and meteorology.\nHigher OC / EC ratios are estimated at rural and remote sites compared to\nurban ones, attributed to more emissions of OC from biofuel use, more\nbiogenic emissions of volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors to SOC,\nand/or transport of aged aerosols. For most sites, higher concentrations of\nOC, EC, and SOC are observed in colder seasons, while SOC / OC is reduced,\nparticularly at rural and remote sites, attributed partly to weaker\natmospheric oxidation and SOC formation compared to summer. Enhanced SOC\nformation from oxidization and anthropogenic activities like biomass\ncombustion is judged to have crucial effects on severe haze events\ncharacterized by high particle concentrations. Several observational studies\nindicate an increasing trend in ambient OC / EC (but not in OC or EC\nindividually) from 2000 to 2010, confirming increased atmospheric oxidation\nof OC across the country. Combining the results of emission estimation and\nobservations, the improvement over prior emission inventories is indicated\nby inter-annual comparisons and correlation analysis. It is also indicated,\nhowever, that the estimated growth in emissions might be faster than\nobserved growth, and that some sources with high primary OC / EC, such as burning\nof biomass, are still underestimated. Further studies to determine changing\nEFs over time in the residential sector and to compare to other\nmeasurements, such as satellite observations, are thus suggested to improve\nunderstanding of the levels and trends of primary carbonaceous aerosol\nemissions in China.",

The growth step is crucial because it controls the number of particles\nthat can become cloud condensation nuclei. Among various physical and\nchemical processes contributing to particle growth, condensation by organic\nvapors has been suggested as important. In order to better understand the\ninfluence of biogenic emissions on particle growth, we carried out modeling\nstudies of NPF events during the BEACHON-ROCS (Bio\u2013hydro\u2013atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosol,\nCarbon, H2O, Organics & Nitrogen \u2013 Rocky Mountain Organic Carbon Study) campaign at Manitou\nExperimental Forest Observatory in Colorado, USA. The site is representative\nof the semi-arid western USA. With the latest Criegee intermediate reaction\nrates implemented in the chemistry scheme, the model underestimates sulfuric\nacid concentration by 50 %, suggesting either missing sources of\natmospheric sulfuric acid or an overestimated sink term. The results\nemphasize the contribution from biogenic volatile organic compound emissions\nto particle growth by demonstrating the effects of the oxidation products of\nmonoterpenes and 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO). Monoterpene oxidation products\nare shown to influence the nighttime particle loadings significantly, while\ntheir concentrations are insufficient to grow the particles during the day.\nThe growth of ultrafine particles in the daytime appears to be closely related to\nthe OH oxidation products of MBO.",

The optimization of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes turns\nthe hard constraint of prescribing model-derived CO<sub>2</sub> fields into a weak\nconstraint on CO<sub>2</sub>, which allows us to account for uncertainties in CO<sub>2</sub>.\nThe method has been successfully tested in a synthetic inversion setup.

Tao<br /><br />Rapid urbanization throughout eastern China is\nimposing an irreversible effect on local climate and air quality. In this\npaper, we examine the response of a range of meteorological and air quality\nindicators to urbanization. Our study uses the Weather Research and\nForecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF/Chem) to simulate the climate\nand air quality impacts of four hypothetical urbanization scenarios with\nfixed surface pollutant emissions during the month of July from 2008 to 2012.\nAn improved integrated process rate (IPR) analysis scheme is implemented in\nWRF/Chem to investigate the mechanisms behind the forcing\u2013response\nrelationship at the process level. For all years, as urban land area expands,\nconcentrations of CO, elemental carbon (EC), and particulate matter with\naerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) tend to decrease near\nthe surface (below ~ 500 m), but increase at higher altitudes\n(1\u20133 km), resulting in a reduced vertical concentration gradient. On the\nother hand, the O<sub>3</sub> burden, averaged over all newly urbanized grid cells,\nconsistently increases from the surface to a height of about 4 km.\nSensitivity tests show that the responses of pollutant concentrations to the\nspatial extent of urbanization are nearly linear near the surface, but\nnonlinear at higher altitudes. Over eastern China, each 10 % increase in\nnearby urban land coverage on average leads to a decrease of approximately\n2 % in surface concentrations for CO, EC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while for\nO<sub>3</sub> an increase of about 1 % is simulated. At 800 hPa, pollutants'\nconcentrations tend to increase even more rapidly with\nan increase in nearby urban land coverage. This\nindicates that as large tracts of new urban land emerge, the influence of\nurban expansion on meteorology and air pollution would be significantly\namplified. IPR analysis reveals the contribution of individual atmospheric\nprocesses to pollutants' concentration changes. It indicates that, for\nprimary pollutants, the enhanced sink (source) caused by turbulent mixing and\nvertical advection in the lower (upper) atmosphere could be a key factor in\nchanges to simulated vertical profiles. The evolution of secondary pollutants\nis further influenced by the upward relocation of precursors that impact\ngas-phase chemistry for O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol processes for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Our\nstudy indicates that dense urbanization has a moderate dilution effect on\nsurface primary airborne contaminants, but may intensify severe haze and\nozone pollution if local emissions are not well controlled.",

We estimate\nthe direct radiative effect assuming different mixing states (homogeneous,\ncore-shell, and external) with and without absorptive organic aerosol (brown\ncarbon). We find the global-mean direct radiative effect of biofuel\nemissions ranges from \u22120.02 to +0.06 W m<sup>\u22122</sup> across all\nsimulation/mixing-state combinations with regional effects in source regions\nranging from \u22120.2 to +0.8 W m<sup>\u22122</sup>. The global-mean cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect (AIE) ranges from +0.01 to \u22120.02 W m<sup>\u22122</sup> with regional\neffects in source regions ranging from \u22121.0 to \u22120.05 W m<sup>\u22122</sup>. The direct\nradiative effect is strongly dependent on uncertainties in emissions mass,\ncomposition, emissions aerosol size distributions, and assumed optical mixing\nstate, while the indirect effect is dependent on the emissions mass,\nemissions aerosol size distribution, and the choice of model nucleation and\nsecondary organic aerosol schemes. The sign and magnitude of these effects\nhave a strong regional dependence. We conclude that the climate effects of\nbiofuel aerosols are largely unconstrained, and the overall sign of the\naerosol effects is unclear due to uncertainties in model inputs. This\nuncertainty limits our ability to introduce mitigation strategies aimed at\nreducing biofuel black carbon emissions in order to counter warming effects\nfrom greenhouse gases. To better understand the climate impact of particle\nemissions from biofuel combustion, we recommend field/laboratory\nmeasurements to narrow constraints on (1) emissions mass, (2) emission size\ndistribution, (3) mixing state, and (4) ratio of black carbon to organic\naerosol.",

There is an urgent need to\nunderstand the factors that control isoprene emission variability on large\nspatiotemporal scales but such direct observations of isoprene emission do\nnot exist. Two readily available global-scale long-term observation-based\ndata sets hold information about surface isoprene activity: gross primary\nproductivity (GPP) and tropospheric formaldehyde column variability (HCHOv).\nWe analyze multi-year seasonal linear correlations between observed GPP and\nHCHOv. The observed GPP\u2013HCHOv correlation patterns are used to evaluate a\nglobal Earth system model that embeds three alternative leaf-level isoprene\nemission algorithms. GPP and HCHOv are decoupled in the summertime in the southeast\nUS (<i>r</i>=&minus;0.03). In the Amazon, GPP and HCHOv are weakly correlated in\nMarch-April-May (MAM), correlated in June-July-August (JJA) and weakly\nanticorrelated in September-October-November (SON). Isoprene emission\nalgorithms that include soil moisture dependence demonstrate greater skill\nin reproducing the observed interannual seasonal GPP\u2013HCHOv correlations in\nthe southeast US and the Amazon. In isoprene emission models that include\nsoil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is correlated with\nphotosynthesis and anticorrelated with HCHOv. In an isoprene emission model\nwithout soil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is anticorrelated with\nphotosynthesis and correlated with HCHOv. Long-term monitoring of isoprene\nemission, soil moisture and meteorology is required in water-limited\necosystems to improve understanding of the factors controlling isoprene\nemission and its representation in global Earth system models.",

Therefore, accurate\ninformation on gaseous and aerosol emissions from fires for specific regions and\nseasons is critical for air quality forecasts. The Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in geostationary orbit provides fire\nobservations over Africa and the Mediterranean with a temporal\nresolution of 15 min. It thus resolves the complete fire life cycle and\ncaptures the fires' peak intensities,\nwhich is not possible in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\nfire emission inventories like the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS).\nWe evaluate two different operational\nfire radiative power (FRP) products derived from SEVIRI, by studying\na large forest fire in Antalya, Turkey, in July\u2013August 2008. The EUMETSAT\nLand Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF) has higher FRP values during the fire episode than the\nWildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA). It is also in better agreement with the co-located, gridded\nMODIS FRP. Both products miss small fires that frequently occur in the region\nand are detected by MODIS. Emissions are derived from the FRP products. They\nare used along-side GFAS emissions in smoke plume simulations with the Weather\nResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model and\nthe Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. In comparisons with MODIS aerosol optical thickness (AOT)\nand Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), CO and NH<sub>3</sub> observations\nshow that including the diurnal\nvariability of fire emissions improves the spatial distribution and peak\nconcentrations of the simulated smoke plumes associated with this large fire.\nThey also show a large discrepancy between the currently available\noperational FRP products, with the LSA SAF being the most appropriate.",

Kr\u00e4mer<br /><br />For almost two decades, the airborne Fast In-situ Stratospheric Hygrometer (FISH)\n      has stood for accurate and precise measurements of total water mixing ratios\n      (WMR, gas phase + evaporated ice) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere\n      (UT/LS).  Here, we present a comprehensive\n      review of the measurement technique (Lyman-\u03b1 photofragment fluorescence),\n      calibration procedure, accuracy and reliability of FISH.  Crucial for FISH measurement\n      quality is the regular calibration to a water vapor reference, namely\n      the commercial frost-point hygrometer DP30.  In the frame of this work\n      this frost-point hygrometer is compared to German and British traceable\n      metrological water standards and its accuracy is found to be\n      2\u20134 %.  Overall, in the range from 4 to 1000 ppmv, the\n      total accuracy of FISH was found to be 6\u20138 %, as stated\n      in previous publications. For lower mixing ratios down to\n      1 ppmv, the uncertainty reaches a lower limit of\n      0.3 ppmv. For specific, non-atmospheric conditions, as set\n      in experiments at the AIDA chamber \u2013 namely mixing ratios below 10 and\n      above 100 ppmv in combination with high- and low-pressure\n      conditions \u2013 the need to apply a modified FISH calibration evaluation\n      has been identified. The new evaluation improves the agreement of FISH\n      with other hygrometers to \u00b1 10 % accuracy in the\n      respective mixing ratio ranges. Furthermore, a quality check procedure for\n      high total water measurements in cirrus clouds at high pressures\n      (400\u2013500 hPa) is introduced.  The performance of FISH in the\n      field is assessed by reviewing intercomparisons of FISH water vapor\n      data with other in situ and remote sensing hygrometers over the last\n      two decades. We find that the agreement of FISH with the other\n      hygrometers has improved over that time span from overall up to\n      \u00b1 30 % or more to about\n      \u00b1 5\u201320 % @ < 10 ppmv and to\n      \u00b1 0\u201315 % @ > 10 ppmv.\n<br><br>\n      As presented here, the robust and continuous calibration and operation\n      procedures of the FISH instrument over the last two decades establish\n      the position of FISH as one of the core instruments for in situ\n      observations of water vapor in the UT/LS.",

We present a\ndescription of the Fennec airborne observations during 2011 and 2012 over\nthe remote Sahara (Mauritania and Mali) and the advances in the\nunderstanding of mineral dust and boundary layer processes they have\nprovided. Aircraft instrumentation aboard the UK FAAM BAe146 and French\nSAFIRE (Service des Avions Fran\u00e7ais Instrument\u00e9s pour la\nRecherche en Environnement) Falcon 20 is described, with specific focus on instrumentation\nspecially developed for and relevant to Saharan meteorology and dust.

Examples and\napplications of aircraft measurements from the Fennec flights are presented,\nhighlighting new scientific results delivered using a synergy of different\ninstruments and aircraft. These include (1) the first airborne measurement\nof dust particles sizes of up to 300 microns and associated dust fluxes in the\nSaharan atmospheric boundary layer (SABL), (2) dust uplift from the\nbreakdown of the nocturnal low-level jet before becoming visible in SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red\nImager)\nsatellite imagery, (3) vertical profiles of the unique vertical structure of\nturbulent fluxes in the SABL, (4) in situ observations of processes in SABL\nclouds showing dust acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) at \u221215 \u00b0C, (5)\ndual-aircraft observations of the SABL dynamics, thermodynamics and\ncomposition in the Saharan heat low region (SHL), (6) airborne observations\nof a dust storm associated with a cold pool (haboob) issued from deep\nconvection over the Atlas Mountains, (7) the first airborne chemical composition\nmeasurements of dust in the SHL region with differing composition, sources\n(determined using Lagrangian backward trajectory calculations) and\nabsorption properties between 2011 and 2012, (8) coincident ozone and dust\nsurface area measurements suggest coarser particles provide a route for\nozone depletion, (9) discrepancies between airborne coarse-mode size\ndistributions and AERONET (AERosol Robotic NETwork) sunphotometer retrievals under light dust\nloadings.

Ogren<br /><br />Scattering of solar radiation by aerosol particles is highly dependent on\nrelative humidity (RH) as hygroscopic particles take up water with\nincreasing RH. To achieve a better understanding of the effect of aerosol\nhygroscopic growth on light scattering properties and radiative forcing, the\naerosol scattering coefficients at RH in the range of 40 to ~ 90 % were measured using a humidified nephelometer system in the Yangtze\nRiver Delta of China in March 2013. In addition, the aerosol size\ndistribution and chemical composition were measured. During the observation\nperiod, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of enhancement factors at\nRH = 85 % for the scattering coefficient (<i>f</i>(85 %)), backscattering\ncoefficient (<i>f</i><sub>b</sub>(85 %)), and hemispheric backscatter fraction\n(<i>f</i><sub>&beta;</sub>(85 %)) were 1.58 \u00b1 0.12, 1.25 \u00b1 0.07, and\n0.79 \u00b1 0.04, respectively, i.e., aerosol scattering coefficient and\nbackscattering coefficient increased by 58 and 25 % as the RH increased\nfrom 40 to 85 %. Concurrently, the aerosol hemispheric backscatter fraction\ndecreased by 21 %. The relative amount of organic matter (OM) or\ninorganics in PM<sub>1</sub> was found to be a main factor determining the\nmagnitude of <i>f</i>(RH). The highest values of <i>f</i>(RH) corresponded to the aerosols\nwith a small fraction of OM, and vice versa. The relative amount of\nNO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> in fine particles was strongly\ncorrelated with <i>f</i>(85 %), which suggests that\nNO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> played a vital role in aerosol\nhygroscopic growth during this study. The mass fraction of nitrate also had\na close relationship to the curvature of the humidograms;  higher mass fractions\nof nitrate were associated with humidograms that had the least curvature.\nAerosol hygroscopic growth caused a 47 % increase in the calculated\naerosol direct radiative forcing at 85 % RH, compared to the forcing at\n40 % RH.",

Ciais<br /><br />The exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the atmosphere\n  and the Amazon basin have global implications for the current and future\n  climate. Here, the global atmospheric inversion system of the\n  Monitoring of Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) service is\n  used to study the seasonal and interannual variations of\n  biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in Amazonia during the period 2002\u20132010. The\n  system assimilated surface measurements of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> mole\n  fractions made at more than 100 sites over the globe into an atmospheric\n  transport model. The present study adds measurements from four surface\n  stations located in tropical South America, a region poorly covered by\n  CO<sub>2</sub> observations. The estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE)\n  optimized by the inversion are compared to an independent estimate of\n  NEE upscaled from eddy-covariance flux measurements in Amazonia. They\n  are also qualitatively evaluated against reports on the seasonal and\n  interannual variations of the land sink in South America from the\n  scientific literature. We attempt at assessing the impact on NEE of\n  the strong droughts in 2005 and 2010 (due to severe and longer-than-usual\n  dry seasons) and  the extreme rainfall conditions registered in 2009.\n  The spatial variations of the seasonal and interannual variability of\n  optimized NEE are also investigated. While the inversion supports the\n  assumption of strong spatial heterogeneity of these variations, the\n  results reveal critical limitations of the coarse-resolution transport model,\n  the surface observation network in South America during the recent\n  years and the present knowledge of modelling uncertainties in South\n  America that prevent our inversion from capturing the seasonal patterns\n  of fluxes across Amazonia. However, some patterns from the inversion\n  seem consistent with the anomaly of moisture conditions in 2009.",

Biskos<br /><br />Detailed aerosol chemical predictions by a comprehensive model system (i.e.\nPMCAMx, WRF, GEOS-CHEM), along with airborne and ground-based observations,\nare presented and analysed over a wide domain covering the Aegean\nArchipelago. The studied period is 10 successive days in 2011,\ncharacterized by strong northern winds, which is the most frequently\nprevailing synoptic pattern during summer. The submicron aerosol load in the\nlower troposphere above the archipelago is homogenously enriched in sulfate\n(average modelled and measured submicron sulfate of 5.5 and 5.8 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively), followed by organics (2.3 and 4.4 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\nand ammonium (1.5 and 1.7 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>). Aerosol concentrations smoothly\ndecline aloft, reaching lower values (< 1 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup>) above\n4.2 km altitude. The evaluation criteria rate the model results for sulfate,\nammonium, chloride, elemental carbon, organic carbon and total PM<sub>10</sub>\nmass concentrations as \"good\", indicating a satisfactory representation of\nthe aerosol chemistry and precursors. Higher model discrepancies are\nconfined to the highest (e.g. peak sulfate values) and lowest ends (e.g.\nnitrate) of the airborne aerosol mass size distribution, as well as in\nairborne organic aerosol concentrations (model underestimation ca. 50 %).\nThe latter is most likely related to the intense fire activity at the\neastern Balkan area and the Black Sea coastline, which is not represented in\nthe current model application. The investigation of the effect of local\nvariables on model performance revealed that the best agreement between\npredictions and observations occurs during high winds from the northeast, as\nwell as for the area confined above the archipelago and up to 2.2 km\naltitude. The atmospheric ageing of biogenic particles is suggested to be\nactivated in the aerosol chemistry module, when treating organics in a\nsufficient nitrogen and sulfate-rich environment, such as that over the\nAegean basin. More than 70 % of the predicted aerosol mass over the Aegean\nArchipelago during a representative Etesian episode is related to transport\nof aerosols and their precursors from outside the modelling domain.",

Boichu, L. Clarisse, J.-C. P\u00e9r\u00e9, H. Herbin, P. Goloub, F. Thieuleux, F. Ducos, C. Clerbaux, and D. Tanr\u00e9<br /><br />Sulfur-rich degassing, which is mostly composed of sulfur dioxide\n      (SO<sub>2</sub>), plays a major role in the overall impact of volcanism on the\n      atmosphere and climate.  The accurate assessment of this impact is\n      currently hampered by the poor knowledge of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub>\n      emissions. Here, using an inversion procedure, we show how\n      assimilating snapshots of the volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> load derived from the\n      Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) allows for\n      reconstructing both the flux and altitude of the SO<sub>2</sub> emissions with\n      an hourly resolution. For this purpose, the regional\n      chemistry-transport model CHIMERE is used to describe the dispersion\n      of SO<sub>2</sub> when released in the atmosphere. As proof of concept, we\n      study the 10 April 2011 eruption of the Etna volcano (Italy), which\n      represents one of the few volcanoes instrumented on the ground for the\n      continuous monitoring of SO<sub>2</sub> degassing.\n<br><br>\n      We find that the SO<sub>2</sub> flux time-series retrieved from satellite\n      imagery using the inverse scheme is in agreement with ground\n      observations during ash-poor phases of the eruption. However, large\n      discrepancies are observed during the ash-rich paroxysmal phase as\n      a result of enhanced plume opacity affecting ground-based ultraviolet\n      (UV) spectroscopic retrievals. As a consequence, the SO<sub>2</sub> emission\n      rate derived from the ground is underestimated by almost one order of\n      magnitude.\n<br><br>\n      Altitudes of the SO<sub>2</sub> emissions predicted by the inverse scheme are\n      validated against an RGB image of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) capturing the near-source\n      atmospheric pathways followed by Etna plumes, in combination with\n      forward trajectories from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian\n      Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. At a large distance from the\n      source, modelled SO<sub>2</sub> altitudes are compared with independent\n      information on the volcanic cloud height. We find that the altitude\n      predicted by the inverse scheme is in agreement with snapshots of the\n      SO<sub>2</sub> height retrieved from recent algorithms exploiting the high\n      spectral resolution of IASI.  The validity of the modelled SO<sub>2</sub>\n      altitude is further confirmed by the detection of a layer of particles\n      at the same altitude by the spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Analysis of\n      CALIOP colour and depolarization ratios suggests that these particles\n      consist of sulfate aerosols formed from precursory volcanic SO<sub>2</sub>.\n<br><br>\n      The reconstruction of emission altitude, through inversion procedures\n      which assimilate volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts, requires\n      specific meteorological conditions, especially sufficient wind shear\n      so that gas parcels emitted at different altitudes follow distinct\n      trajectories. We consequently explore the possibility and limits of\n      assimilating in inverse schemes infrared (IR) imagery of the volcanic\n      SO<sub>2</sub> cloud altitude which will render the inversion procedure\n      independent of the wind shear prerequisite.",

S. Malley, C. F. Braban, P. Dumitrean, J. N. Cape, and M. R. Heal<br /><br />The impact of 27 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the regional O<sub>3</sub>\nincrement was investigated using measurements made at the UK EMEP supersites\nHarwell (1999\u20132001 and 2010\u20132012) and Auchencorth (2012). Ozone at these\nsites is representative of rural O<sub>3</sub> in south-east England and northern\nUK, respectively. The monthly-diurnal regional O<sub>3</sub> increment was defined\nas the difference between the regional and hemispheric background O<sub>3</sub>\nconcentrations, respectively, derived from oxidant vs. NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> correlation\nplots, and cluster analysis of back trajectories arriving at Mace Head,\nIreland. At Harwell, which had substantially greater regional O<sub>3</sub>\nincrements than Auchencorth, variation in the regional\nO<sub>3</sub>  increment mirrored\nafternoon depletion of anthropogenic VOCs due to photochemistry (after\naccounting for diurnal changes in boundary layer mixing depth, and weighting\nVOC concentrations according to their photochemical ozone creation\npotential). A positive regional O<sub>3</sub> increment occurred consistently\nduring the summer, during which time afternoon photochemical depletion was\ncalculated for the majority of measured VOCs, and to the greatest extent for\nethene and m+p-xylene. This indicates that, of the measured VOCs, ethene\nand m+p-xylene emissions reduction would be most effective in reducing the\nregional O<sub>3</sub> increment but that reductions in a larger number of VOCs\nwould be required for further improvement.\n<br><br>\nThe VOC diurnal photochemical depletion was linked to anthropogenic sources\nof the VOC emissions through the integration of gridded anthropogenic VOC\nemission estimates over 96 h air-mass back trajectories. This\ndemonstrated that one factor limiting the effectiveness of VOC gridded\nemissions for use in measurement and modelling studies is the highly\naggregated nature of the 11 SNAP (Selected Nomenclature for Air Pollution) source sectors in which they are reported,\nas monthly variation in speciated VOC trajectory emissions did not reflect\nmonthly changes in individual VOC diurnal photochemical depletion.\nAdditionally, the major VOC emission source sectors during elevated regional\nO<sub>3</sub> increment at Harwell were more narrowly defined through\ndisaggregation of the SNAP emissions to 91 NFR (Nomenclature for Reporting) codes (i.e. sectors 3D2\n(domestic solvent use), 3D3 (other product use) and 2D2 (food and drink)).\nHowever, spatial variation in the contribution of NFR sectors to parent SNAP\nemissions could only be accounted for at the country level. Hence, the\nfuture reporting of gridded VOC emissions in source sectors more highly\ndisaggregated than currently (e.g. to NFR codes) would facilitate a more\nprecise identification of those VOC sources most important for mitigation of\nthe impact of VOCs on O<sub>3</sub> formation.\n<br><br>\nIn summary, this work presents a clear methodology for achieving a coherent\nVOC, regional-O<sub>3</sub>-impact chemical climate using measurement data and\nexplores the effect of limited emission and measurement species on the\nunderstanding of the regional VOC contribution to O<sub>3</sub> concentrations.",

Evans, N. Kholod, V. Malyshev, S. Tretyakova, E. Gusev, S. Yu, and A. Barinov<br /><br />Black carbon (BC) is a potent pollutant because of its effects on climate\nchange, ecosystems and human health. Black carbon has a particularly\npronounced impact as a climate forcer in the Arctic because of its effect on\nsnow albedo and cloud formation. We have estimated BC emissions from diesel\nsources in the Murmansk Region and Murmansk City, the largest city in the world\nabove the Arctic Circle. In this study we developed a detailed inventory of\ndiesel sources including on-road vehicles, off-road transport (mining,\nlocomotives, construction and agriculture), ships and diesel generators.\nFor on-road transport, we conducted several surveys to understand the\nvehicle fleet and driving patterns, and, for all sources, we also relied on\npublicly available local data sets and analysis. We calculated that BC\nemissions in the Murmansk Region were 0.40 Gg in 2012. The mining industry is\nthe largest source of BC emissions in the region, emitting 69 % of all BC\nemissions because of its large diesel consumption and absence of emissions\ncontrols. On-road vehicles are the second largest source, emitting about\n13 % of emissions. Old heavy duty trucks are the major source of\nemissions. Emission controls on new vehicles limit total emissions from\non-road transportation. Vehicle traffic and fleet surveys show that many of\nthe older cars on the registry are lightly or never used. We also estimated\nthat total BC emissions from diesel sources in Russia were 50.8 Gg in 2010,\nand on-road transport contributed 49 % of diesel BC emissions.\nAgricultural machinery is also a significant source Russia-wide, in part\nbecause of the lack of controls on off-road vehicles.",

Miyazaki, H. J. Eskes, and K. Sudo<br /><br />We present the results from an 8-year tropospheric chemistry\n  reanalysis for the period 2005\u20132012 obtained by assimilating\n  multiple data sets from the OMI, MLS, TES, and MOPITT\n  satellite instruments. The reanalysis calculation was conducted\n  using a global chemical transport model and an ensemble Kalman\n  filter technique that simultaneously optimises the chemical\n  concentrations of various species and emissions of several\n  precursors. The optimisation of both the concentration and the\n  emission fields is an efficient method to correct the entire\n  tropospheric profile and its year-to-year variations, and to adjust\n  various tracers chemically linked to the species\n  assimilated. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite,\n  and ozonesonde observations demonstrate the quality of the analysed\n  O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO concentrations on regional\n  and global scales and for both seasonal and year-to-year variations\n  from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. The data\n  assimilation statistics imply persistent reduction of model error\n  and improved representation of emission variability, but they also show\n  that discontinuities in the availability of the measurements lead to\n  a degradation of the reanalysis. The decrease in the number of\n  assimilated measurements increased the ozonesonde-minus-analysis\n  difference after 2010 and caused spurious variations in the\n  estimated emissions. The Northern/Southern Hemisphere OH\n  ratio was modified considerably due to the multiple-species\n  assimilation and became closer to an observational estimate, which\n  played an important role in propagating observational information\n  among various chemical fields and affected the emission\n  estimates. The consistent concentration and emission products\n  provide unique information on year-to-year variations in the\n  atmospheric environment.",
