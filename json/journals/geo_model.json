Anderson, W. C. Gentleman, and A. Yool<br /><br />Modelling marine ecosystems requires insight and judgement when it comes to\ndeciding upon appropriate model structure, equations and parameterisation.\nMany processes are relatively poorly understood and tough decisions must be\nmade as to how to mathematically simplify the real world. Here, we present\nan efficient plankton modelling testbed, EMPOWER-1.0 (Efficient Model of Planktonic ecOsystems WrittEn in R), coded in the freely\navailable language R. The testbed uses simple two-layer \"slab\" physics\nwhereby a seasonally varying mixed layer which contains the planktonic\nmarine ecosystem is positioned above a deep layer that contains only\nnutrient. As such, EMPOWER-1.0 provides a readily available and easy to use\ntool for evaluating model structure, formulations and parameterisation. The\ncode is transparent and modular such that modifications and changes to model\nformulation are easily implemented allowing users to investigate and\nfamiliarise themselves with the inner workings of their models. It can be\nused either for preliminary model testing to set the stage for further work,\ne.g. coupling the ecosystem model to 1-D or 3-D physics, or for undertaking\nfront line research in its own right. EMPOWER-1.0 also serves as an ideal\nteaching tool. In order to demonstrate the utility of EMPOWER-1.0, we\nimplemented a simple nutrient\u2013phytoplankton\u2013zooplankton\u2013detritus (NPZD)\necosystem model and carried out both a parameter tuning exercise and\nstructural sensitivity analysis. Parameter tuning was demonstrated for four\ncontrasting ocean sites, focusing on station BIOTRANS in the North Atlantic\n(47\u00b0 N, 20\u00b0 W), highlighting both the utility\nof undertaking a planned sensitivity analysis for this purpose, yet also the\nsubjectivity which nevertheless surrounds the choice of which parameters to\ntune. Structural sensitivity tests were then performed comparing different\nequations for calculating daily depth-integrated photosynthesis, as well as\nmortality terms for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Regarding the\ncalculation of daily photosynthesis, for example, results indicated that the\nmodel was relatively insensitive to the choice of photosynthesis\u2013irradiance\ncurve, but markedly sensitive to the method of calculating light attenuation\nin the water column. The work highlights the utility of EMPOWER-1.0 as a\nmeans of comprehending, diagnosing and formulating equations for the\ndynamics of marine ecosystems.",

The iESM is based\n      upon coupling an integrated assessment model (IAM) and an Earth system model (ESM) into a common modeling infrastructure.  IAMs are the\n      primary tool for describing the human\u2013Earth system, including the\n      sources of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived species (SLS),\n      land use and land cover change (LULCC), and other resource-related drivers of\n      anthropogenic climate change.  ESMs are the primary scientific tools\n      for examining the physical, chemical, and biogeochemical impacts of\n      human-induced changes to the climate system.  The iESM project\n      integrates the economic and human-dimension modeling of an IAM and\n      a fully coupled ESM within a single simulation system while\n      maintaining the separability of each model if needed. Both IAM and ESM\n      codes are developed and used by large communities and have been\n      extensively applied in recent national and international climate\n      assessments.  By introducing heretofore-omitted feedbacks between\n      natural and societal drivers, we can improve scientific understanding\n      of the human\u2013Earth system dynamics.  Potential applications include\n      studies of the interactions and feedbacks leading to the timing,\n      scale, and geographic distribution of emissions trajectories and other\n      human influences, corresponding climate effects, and the subsequent\n      impacts of a changing climate on human and natural systems.  This\n      paper describes the formulation, requirements, implementation,\n      testing, and resulting functionality of the first version of the iESM\n      released to the global climate community.",

Here we present a revised version of this\nmodel. The present model, as well as the sensitivity simulations leading up\nto this version, have been compared to a data set of in situ measurements of\nnutrient and chlorophyll from the Norwegian Sea and the Atlantic sector of\nthe Arctic Ocean. The model revisions having the most impact included adding\ndiatoms to the diet of microzooplankton, increasing microzooplankton\ngrazing rate and decreasing the  silicate-to-nitrate ratio in diatoms. Model runs\nare performed both with a coarse- (~ 50 km) and\nhigher-resolution (~ 15 km) model configuration, both covering\nthe North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. While the new model formulation\nimproves the results in both the coarse- and high-resolution model, the\nnutrient bias is smaller in the high-resolution model, probably as a result\nof the better resolution of the main processes and improved circulation. The\nfinal revised version delivers satisfactory results for all three nutrients\nas well as improved results for chlorophyll in terms of the annual cycle\namplitude. However, for chlorophyll the correlation with in situ data\nremains relatively low.

E. Ivey, H. A. Holmes, Y. T. Hu, J. A. Mulholland, and A. G. Russell<br /><br />An integral part of air quality management is knowledge of the impact of\npollutant sources on ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM).\nThere is also a growing desire to directly use source impact estimates in\nhealth studies; however, source impacts cannot be directly measured. Several\nlimitations are inherent in most source apportionment methods motivating the\ndevelopment of a novel hybrid approach that is used to estimate source\nimpacts by combining the capabilities of receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs). The hybrid CTM\u2013RM method calculates adjustment\nfactors to refine the CTM-estimated impact of sources at monitoring sites\nusing pollutant species observations and the results of CTM sensitivity\nanalyses, though it does not directly generate spatial source impact fields.\nThe CTM used here is the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and\nthe RM approach is based on the chemical mass balance (CMB) model. This work\npresents a method that utilizes kriging to spatially interpolate\nsource-specific impact adjustment factors to generate revised CTM source\nimpact fields from the CTM\u2013RM method results, and is applied for January\n2004 over the continental United States. The kriging step is evaluated using\ndata withholding and by comparing results to data from alternative networks.\nData withholding also provides an estimate of method uncertainty. Directly\napplied (hybrid, HYB) and spatially interpolated (spatial hybrid, SH) hybrid\nadjustment factors at withheld observation sites had a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.89, a linear regression slope of 0.83 \u00b1 0.02, and an\nintercept of 0.14 \u00b1 0.02. Refined source contributions reflect current\nknowledge of PM emissions (e.g., significant differences in biomass burning\nimpact fields). Concentrations of 19 species and total PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass\nwere reconstructed for withheld observation sites using HYB and SH\nadjustment factors. The mean concentrations of total PM<sub>2.5</sub> at\nwithheld observation sites were 11.7 (\u00b1 8.3), 16.3 (\u00b1 11), 8.59\n(\u00b1 4.7), and 9.2 (\u00b1 5.7) \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup> for the\nobservations, CTM, HYB, and SH predictions, respectively. Correlations\nimproved for concentrations of major ions, including nitrate (CMAQ\u2013DDM (decoupled direct method):\n0.404, SH: 0.449), ammonium (CMAQ\u2013DDM: 0.454, SH: 0.492), and sulfate\n(CMAQ\u2013DDM: 0.706, SH: 0.730). Errors in simulated concentrations\nof metals were reduced considerably: 295 % (CMAQ\u2013DDM) to 139 % (SH) for\nvanadium; and 1340 % (CMAQ\u2013DDM) to 326 % (SH) for manganese. Errors in simulated concentrations of some metals are expected to remain\ngiven the uncertainties in source profiles. Species concentrations were\nreconstructed using SH results, and the error relative to\nobserved concentrations was greatly reduced as compared to CTM-simulated\nconcentrations. Results demonstrate that the hybrid method along with a\nspatial extension can be used for large-scale, spatially resolved source\napportionment studies where observational data are spatially and temporally\nlimited.",

B\u00fcgelmayer, D. M. Roche, and H. Renssen<br /><br />Recent modelling studies have indicated that icebergs play an active role in\nthe climate system as they interact with the ocean and the atmosphere. The\nicebergs' impact is due to their slowly released meltwater, which freshens\nand cools the ocean and consequently alters the ocean stratification and the\nsea-ice conditions. The spatial distribution of the icebergs and their\nmeltwater depends on the atmospheric and oceanic forces acting on them as\nwell as on the initial icebergs' size. The studies conducted so far have in\ncommon that the icebergs were moved by reconstructed or modelled forcing\nfields and that the initial size distribution of the icebergs was prescribed\naccording to present-day observations. To study the sensitivity of the\nmodelled iceberg distribution to initial and boundary conditions, we\nperformed 15 sensitivity experiments using the <i>i</i>LOVECLIM climate model that\nincludes actively coupled ice sheet and iceberg modules, to analyse (1) the\nimpact of the atmospheric and oceanic forces on the iceberg transport, mass\nand melt flux distribution, and (2) the effect of the initial iceberg size on\nthe resulting Northern Hemisphere climate including the Greenland ice sheet,\ndue to feedback mechanisms such as altered atmospheric temperatures, under\ndifferent climate conditions (pre-industrial, high/low radiative forcing).\nOur results show that, under equilibrated pre-industrial conditions, the\noceanic currents cause the icebergs to stay close to the Greenland and North\nAmerican coast, whereas the atmospheric forcing quickly distributes them\nfurther away from their calving site. Icebergs remaining close to Greenland\nlast up to 2 years longer as they reside in generally cooler waters.\nMoreover, we find that local variations in the spatial distribution due to\ndifferent iceberg sizes do not result in different climate states and\nGreenland ice sheet volume, independent of the prevailing climate conditions\n(pre-industrial, warming or cooling climate). Therefore, we conclude that\nlocal differences in the distribution of their melt flux do not alter the\nprevailing Northern Hemisphere climate and ice sheet under equilibrated\nconditions and continuous supply of icebergs. Furthermore, our results\nsuggest that the applied radiative forcing scenarios have a stronger impact\non climate than the initial size distribution of the icebergs.",

Following the Part 1\npaper that focuses on the evaluation of the 2006 simulations, this Part 2\npaper focuses on a comparison of model performance in 2006 and 2010 as well as\nanalysis of the responses of air quality and meteorology\u2013chemistry\ninteractions to changes in emissions and meteorology from 2006 to 2010. In\ngeneral, emissions for gaseous and aerosol species decrease from 2006 to\n2010, leading to a reduction in gaseous and aerosol concentrations and\nassociated changes in radiation and cloud variables due to various feedback\nmechanisms. WRF/Chem is able to reproduce most observations and the observed\nvariation trends from 2006 to 2010, despite its slightly worse performance\nthan WRF that is likely due to inaccurate chemistry feedbacks resulting from\nless accurate emissions and chemical boundary conditions (BCONs) in 2010.\nCompared to 2006, the performance for most meteorological variables in 2010\ngives lower normalized mean biases but higher normalized mean errors and\nlower correlation coefficients. The model also shows poorer performance for\nmost chemical variables in 2010. This could be attributed to\nunderestimations in emissions of some species, such as primary organic\naerosol in some areas of the US in 2010, and inaccurate chemical BCONs and\nmeteorological predictions. The inclusion of chemical feedbacks in WRF/Chem\nreduces biases in meteorological predictions in 2010; however, it increases\nerrors and weakens correlations comparing to WRF simulations. Sensitivity\nsimulations show that the net changes in meteorological variables from 2006\nto 2010 are mostly influenced by changes in meteorology and those of ozone\nand fine particulate matter are influenced to a large extent by emissions\nand/or chemical BCONs and to a lesser extent by changes in meteorology.\nUsing a different set of emissions and/or chemical BCONs helps   improve the\nperformance of individual variables, although it does not improve the degree\nof agreement with observed interannual trends. These results indicate a\nneed to further improve the accuracy and consistency of emissions and\nchemical BCONs, the representations of SOA and chemistry\u2013meteorology\nfeedbacks in the online-coupled models.",

Oschlies<br /><br />The natural abundance of <sup>14</sup>C in total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in seawater\n(DIC) is a property applied to evaluate the water age structure and\ncirculation in the ocean and in ocean models. In this study we use three\ndifferent representations of the global ocean circulation augmented with\na suite of idealised tracers to study the potential and limitations of using\nnatural <sup>14</sup>C to determine water age, which is the time elapsed since\na body of water has been in contact with the atmosphere. We find that,\nglobally, bulk <sup>14</sup>C-age is dominated by two equally important components,\none associated with ageing, i.e. the time component of circulation, and one\nassociated with a \"preformed <sup>14</sup>C-age\". The latter quantity exists\nbecause of the slow and incomplete atmosphere\u2013ocean equilibration of\n<sup>14</sup>C particularly in high latitudes where many water masses form. In the\nocean's interior, preformed <sup>14</sup>C-age behaves like a passive tracer. The\nrelative contribution of the preformed component to bulk <sup>14</sup>C-age varies\nregionally within a given model, but also between models. Regional\nvariability in the Atlantic Ocean is associated with the mixing of waters\nwith very different end members of preformed <sup>14</sup>C-age. Here, variations\nin the preformed component over space and time mask the circulation component\nto an extent that its patterns are not detectable from bulk <sup>14</sup>C-age.\nBetween models, the variability of preformed <sup>14</sup>C-age can also be considerable (factor of\n2), related to the combination of physical model parameters, which influence\ncirculation dynamics or gas exchange. The preformed component was found to be\nvery sensitive to gas exchange and moderately sensitive to ice cover. In our\nmodel evaluation, the choice of the gas-exchange constant from within the\ncurrently accepted range of uncertainty had such a strong influence on\npreformed and bulk <sup>14</sup>C-age that if model evaluation would be based on\nbulk <sup>14</sup>C-age, it could easily impair the evaluation and tuning of\na model's circulation on global and regional scales. Based on the results of\nthis study, we propose that considering preformed <sup>14</sup>C-age is critical\nfor a correct assessment of circulation in ocean models.",

Luyssaert<br /><br />Since 70 % of\nglobal forests are managed and forests impact the global carbon cycle and the\nenergy exchange with the overlying atmosphere, forest management has the\npotential to mitigate climate change. Yet, none of the land-surface models\nused in Earth system models, and therefore none of today's predictions of\nfuture climate, accounts for the interactions between climate and forest\nmanagement. We addressed this gap in modelling capability by developing and\nparametrising a version of the ORCHIDEE  land-surface model to simulate the biogeochemical and biophysical\neffects of forest management. The most significant changes between the new\nbranch called ORCHIDEE-CAN (SVN r2290) and the trunk version of ORCHIDEE (SVN\nr2243) are the allometric-based allocation of carbon to leaf, root, wood,\nfruit and reserve pools; the transmittance, absorbance and reflectance of\nradiation within the canopy; and the vertical discretisation of the energy\nbudget calculations. In addition, conceptual changes were introduced towards\na better process representation for the interaction of radiation with snow,\nthe hydraulic architecture of plants, the representation of forest management\nand a numerical solution for the photosynthesis formalism of Farquhar, von\nCaemmerer and Berry. For consistency reasons, these changes were extensively\nlinked throughout the code. Parametrisation was revisited after introducing\n12 new parameter sets that represent specific tree species or genera rather\nthan a group of often distantly related or even unrelated species, as is the\ncase in widely used plant functional types. Performance of the new model was\ncompared against the trunk and validated against independent spatially\nexplicit data for basal area, tree height, canopy structure,\ngross primary production (GPP), albedo and evapotranspiration over Europe. For\nall tested variables, ORCHIDEE-CAN outperformed the trunk regarding its\nability to reproduce large-scale spatial patterns as well as their\ninter-annual variability over Europe. Depending on the data stream,\nORCHIDEE-CAN had a 67 to 92 % chance to reproduce the spatial and temporal\nvariability of the validation data.",

Simons, W. W. Immerzeel, and P. Droogers<br /><br />This paper introduces and presents the Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY)\nmodel (v2.0), its development background, its underlying concepts, and some\nexample applications. SPHY has been developed with the explicit aim of\nsimulating terrestrial hydrology on flexible scales, under various\nphysiographical and hydroclimatic conditions, by integrating key components\nfrom existing and well-tested models. SPHY is a spatially distributed leaky\nbucket type of model, and is applied on a cell-by-cell basis. The model is\nwritten in the Python programming language using the PCRaster dynamic\nmodeling framework. SPHY (i) integrates most hydrologic processes, (ii) has\nthe flexibility to be applied in a wide range of hydrologic applications, and\n(iii) on various scales, and (iv) can easily be implemented. The most\nrelevant hydrological processes that are integrated into the SPHY model are\nrainfall\u2013runoff processes, cryosphere processes, evapotranspiration\nprocesses, the dynamic evolution of vegetation cover, lake/reservoir outflow,\nand the simulation of root-zone moisture contents. Studies in which the SPHY\nmodel was successfully applied and tested are described in this paper,\nincluding (i) real-time soil moisture predictions to support irrigation\nmanagement in lowland areas, (ii) climate change impact studies in snow- and\nglacier-fed river basins, and (iii) operational flow forecasting in\nmountainous catchments.",

G. Terranova, S. L. Gariano, P. Iaquinta, and G. G. R. Iovine<br /><br /><sup>GA</sup><i>SAKe</i> is a new hydrological model aimed at forecasting\nthe triggering of landslides. The model is based on genetic algorithms and\nallows one to obtain thresholds for the prediction of slope failures using\ndates of landslide activations and rainfall series. It can be applied to\neither single landslides or a set of similar slope movements in a homogeneous\nenvironment.\n<br><br>\nCalibration of the model provides families of optimal, discretized solutions\n(kernels) that maximize the fitness function. Starting from the kernels, the\ncorresponding mobility functions (i.e., the predictive tools) can be\nobtained through convolution with the rain series. The base time of the\nkernel is related to the magnitude of the considered slope movement, as well\nas to the hydro-geological complexity of the site. Generally, shorter base\ntimes are expected for shallow slope instabilities compared to larger-scale\nphenomena. Once validated, the model can be applied to estimate the timing\nof future landslide activations in the same study area, by employing\nmeasured or forecasted rainfall series.\n<br><br>\nExamples of application of <sup>GA</sup><i>SAKe</i> to a medium-size slope\nmovement (the Uncino landslide at San Fili, in Calabria, southern Italy) and\nto a set of shallow landslides (in the Sorrento Peninsula, Campania, southern\nItaly) are discussed. In both cases, a successful calibration of the model\nhas been achieved, despite unavoidable uncertainties concerning the dates of\noccurrence of the slope movements. In particular, for the Sorrento Peninsula\ncase, a fitness of 0.81 has been obtained by calibrating the model against 10\ndates of landslide activation; in the Uncino case, a fitness of 1 (i.e.,\nneither missing nor false alarms) has been achieved using five activations.\nAs for temporal validation, the experiments performed by considering further\ndates of activation have also proved satisfactory.\n<br><br>\nIn view of early-warning applications for civil protection, the capability\nof the model to simulate the occurrences of the Uncino landslide has been\ntested by means of a progressive, self-adaptive procedure. Finally, a\nsensitivity analysis has been performed by taking into account the main\nparameters of the model.\n<br><br>\nThe obtained results are quite promising, given the high performance of the\nmodel against different types of slope instabilities characterized by\nseveral historical activations. Nevertheless, further refinements are still\nneeded for application to landslide risk mitigation within early-warning and\ndecision-support systems.",

For the\n          preparatory studies and to support the instrument deployment\n          during the field campaign, a dedicated version of the\n          operational convective-scale Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME)-France model was\n          developed: the AROME-WMED (West Mediterranean Sea) model.  It covers the western\n          Mediterranean basin with a 48 h forecast range.  It\n          provided real-time analyses and forecasts which were sent\n          daily to the HyMeX operational centre to forecast high-precipitation events and to help decision makers on the\n          deployment of meteorological instruments.  This paper presents\n          the main features of this numerical weather prediction\n          system in terms of data assimilation and forecast. Some\n          specific data of the HyMeX SOP were assimilated in real\n          time.\n\n<br><br>\n\n          The forecast skill of AROME-WMED is then assessed with\n          objective scores and compared to the operational\n          AROME-France model, for both autumn 2012 (05 September to 06 November 2012) and winter 2013 (01 February to 15 March 2013)\n          SOPs.\n          The overall performance of AROME-WMED is\ngood for the first HyMeX special observation period (SOP1) (i.e. mean 2 m temperature root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.7 \u00b0C and mean\n2 m relative humidity RMSE of 10 % for the 0\u201330 h forecast ranges) and similar to those of\nAROME-France for the 0\u201330 h common forecast range (maximal absolute difference of 2 m\ntemperature RMSE of 0.2 \u00b0C and 0.21 % for the 2 m relative humidity); conversely, for the 24\u201348 h\nforecast range it is less accurate (relative loss between 10 and 12 % in 2 m\ntemperature and relative humidity RMSE, and equitable threat score (ETS) for 24 h accumulated rainfall), but it\nremains useful for scheduling observation deployment.\n          The characteristics of parameters,\n          such as precipitation, temperature or humidity, are\n          illustrated by one heavy precipitation case study that\n          occurred over the south of Spain.",

A. Thomas, M. Kahnert, C. Andersson, H. Kokkola, U. Hansson, C. Jones, J. Langner, and A. Devasthale<br /><br />To reduce uncertainties and hence to obtain a better estimate of aerosol\n(direct and indirect) radiative forcing, next generation climate models aim\nfor a tighter coupling between chemistry transport models and regional\nclimate models and a better representation of aerosol\u2013cloud interactions. In\nthis study, this coupling is done by first forcing the Rossby Center regional\nclimate model (RCA4) with ERA-Interim lateral boundaries and sea surface\ntemperature (SST) using the standard cloud droplet number concentration\n(CDNC) formulation (hereafter, referred to as the \"stand-alone RCA4\nversion\" or \"CTRL\" simulation). In the stand-alone RCA4 version, CDNCs are\nconstants distinguishing only between land and ocean surface. The meteorology\nfrom this simulation is then used to drive the chemistry transport model,\nMultiple-scale Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH), which is coupled\nonline with the aerosol dynamics model, Sectional Aerosol module for Large\nScale Applications (SALSA). CDNC fields obtained from MATCH\u2013SALSA are then\nfed back into a new RCA4 simulation. In this new simulation (referred to as\n\"MOD\" simulation), all parameters remain the same as in the first run\nexcept for the CDNCs provided by MATCH\u2013SALSA. Simulations are carried out\nwith this model setup for the period 2005\u20132012 over Europe, and the\ndifferences in cloud microphysical properties and radiative fluxes as a\nresult of local CDNC changes and possible model responses are analysed.\n<br><br>\nOur study shows substantial improvements in cloud microphysical properties\nwith the input of the MATCH\u2013SALSA derived 3-D CDNCs compared to the\nstand-alone RCA4 version. This model setup improves the spatial, seasonal and\nvertical distribution of CDNCs with a higher concentration observed over\ncentral Europe during boreal summer (JJA) and over eastern Europe and Russia\nduring winter (DJF). Realistic cloud droplet radii (CD radii) values have\nbeen simulated with the maxima reaching 13 \u03bcm, whereas in the\nstand-alone version the values reached only 5 \u03bcm. A substantial\nimprovement in the distribution of the cloud liquid-water paths (CLWP) was\nobserved when compared to the satellite retrievals from the Moderate\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the boreal summer months.\nThe median and standard deviation values from the \"MOD\" simulation are\ncloser to observations than those obtained using the stand-alone RCA4\nversion. These changes resulted in a significant decrease in the total annual\nmean net fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by \u22125 W m<sup>\u22122</sup> over\nthe domain selected in the study. The TOA net fluxes from the \"MOD\"\nsimulation show a better agreement with the retrievals from the Clouds and\nthe Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument. The aerosol indirect\neffects are estimated in the \"MOD\" simulation in comparison to the\npre-industrial aerosol emissions (1900). Our simulations estimated the domain\naveraged annual mean total radiative forcing of \u22120.64 W m<sup>\u22122</sup> with a\nlarger contribution from the first indirect aerosol effect\n(\u22120.57 W m<sup>\u22122</sup>) than from the second indirect aerosol effect\n(\u22120.14 W m<sup>\u22122</sup>).",
