        "description": "\n\nWe examine the theoretical foundation of methods to estimate error covariances that are based on analysis residuals in observation space, also known as the Desroziers method. Our analysis also includes the method based on a posteriori diagnostics of variational analysis schemes. A mathematical analysis of convergence is carried out with a simplified regular observation network where we identify stable and unstable fixed-point solutions, examine their rate of convergence, the conditions of convergence to the truth, and compare it with maximum-likelihood estimation. It is shown that the estimation of variance parameters converges to the truth if the error correlation is correctly specified. The convergence being much faster with the analysis increment method than with the method designed for variational analysis schemes. We also propose a combination of the Desroziers\u2019 scheme and the maximum-likelihood estimation method that could be used to estimate the spatial correlation length-scale of observation errors. The estimation of the full error covariance matrices is ill-defined when both observation and background error covariances are estimated with the Desroziers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scheme. The estimation of the full observation error covariance matrix only is well defined. An analysis of the estimation method using a regular observation network reveals that if all eigenvalues of the prescribed background error covariance are smaller than their corresponding innovation covariance eigenvalue, then the estimated error covariance converges to the truth only if the prescribed background error is correctly specified. In the case where some eigenvalues of the background error covariance greatly exceeds those of the innovation covariance, the convergent observation error matrix may become rank-deficient. Its inverse does not exist.\n",

        "description": "\n\nTropical Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) maximum Intra-Seasonal Variability (ISV) and their interaction with local surface winds are investigated applying statistical analysis to observations and to a recent coupled reanalysis over the 2000\u20132009 decade. Five cores of strong ISV emerge, with standard deviation reaching about 1\u00b0C in frontal areas of the three main upwelling systems: equatorial, Angola-Benguela and Senegal-Mauritania (the southern side of the Canary upwelling). West of 10\u00b0W along the equator, a 20-60-day peak caused by tropical instability waves is shown to generate surface wind anomalies through the adjustment of the horizontal surface pressure gradient in addition to the modification of near-surface atmospheric stratification. East of 10\u00b0W along the equator, an intense biweekly oscillation increases the ocean and atmosphere ISV. In the two coastal upwelling fronts, intraseasonal SST anomalies resemble each other. They are shown to be influenced by coastal Kelvin waves in addition to large-scale wind forcing. Over the Angola-Benguela upwelling, coastal wind bursts controlling the SST ISV are associated with anomalously strong pressure patterns related to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, the St. Helena anticyclone, and the Antarctic Oscillation. In the Senegal-Mauritania upwelling, the wind anomalies mainly linked to the Azores anticyclone in the southern front during November to May appear to be connected to the Saharan heat low in the northern front from June to September. In all five regions and as expected for such upwelling regimes, vertical oceanic mixing represents the dominant term in the mixed-layer heat budget. In the equatorial band, as found in previous studies, horizontal advection is equally important, while it appears surprisingly weak in coastal fronts. Finally, a striking result is the general lack of surface wind signal related to the SST ISV in the coastal upwellings.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe performance of three urban land surface models, run in offline mode, with their default external parameters, is evaluated for two distinctly different sites in Helsinki: Torni and Kumpula. The former is a dense city centre site with 22% vegetation, while the latter is a suburban site with over 50% vegetation. At both locations the models are compared against sensible and latent heat fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique, along with snow depth observations. The cold climate experienced by the city causes strong seasonal variations that include snow cover and stable atmospheric conditions.\nMost of the time the three models are able to account for the differences between the study areas as well as the seasonal and diurnal variability of the energy balance components. However, the performances are not systematic across the modelled components, season and surface type. The net all-wave radiation is well simulated, with the greatest uncertainties related to snowmelt timing, when the fraction of snow cover has a key role, particularly in determining the surface albedo. For the turbulent fluxes, more variation between the models is seen which can partly be explained by the different methods in their calculation and partly by surface parameter values. For the sensible heat flux, simulation of wintertime values was the main problem, which also leads to issues in predicting near-surface stabilities particularly at the dense city centre site. All models have the most difficulties in simulating latent heat flux. This study particularly emphasizes that improvements are needed in the parameterization of anthropogenic heat flux and thermal parameters in winter, snow cover in spring and evapotranspiration in order to improve the surface energy balance modelling in cold climate cities.\n",

        "description": "\n\nMixed-phase clouds are an integral part of the Arctic climate system, for precipitation and for their interactions with radiation and thermodynamics. Mixed-phase processes are often poorly represented in global models and many use an empirically-based diagnostic partition between the liquid and ice phase that is dependent solely on temperature. However, increasingly more complex microphysical parameterizations are being implemented allowing a more physical representation of mixed-phase clouds.\nThis study uses in situ observations from the ASCOS field campaign in the central Arctic to assess the impact of a change from a diagnostic to a prognostic parameterization of mixed-phase clouds and increased vertical resolution in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The newer cloud scheme improves the representation of the vertical structure of mixed-phase clouds, with super-cooled liquid water at cloud top and ice precipitating below, improved further with higher vertical resolution. Increased super-cooled liquid water and decreased ice content are both in closer agreement with observations. However, these changes do not result in any substantial improvement in surface radiation, and a warm and moist bias in the lowest part of the atmosphere remains. Both schemes also fail to capture the transitions from overcast to cloud-free conditions. Moreover, whereas the observed cloud layer is frequently decoupled from the surface, the modelled clouds remain coupled to the surface most of the time. The changes implemented to the cloud scheme are an important step forward in improving the representation of Arctic clouds, but improvements in other aspects such as boundary layer turbulence, cloud radiative properties, sensitivity to low aerosol concentrations and representation of the sea-ice surface may also need to be addressed.\n",

        "description": "\nObservations of tropical convection from precipitation radar and the concurring large-scale atmospheric state at two locations (Darwin and Kwajalein) are used to establish effective stochastic models to parameterise subgrid-scale tropical convective activity. Two approaches are presented which rely on the assumption that tropical convection induces a stationary equilibrium distribution. In the first approach we parameterise convection variables such as convective area fraction as an instantaneous random realisation conditioned on the large-scale vertical velocities according to a probability density function estimated from the observations. In the second approach convection variables are generated in a Markov process conditioned on the large-scale vertical velocity, allowing for non-trivial temporal correlations. Despite the different prevalent atmospheric and oceanic regimes at the two locations, with Kwajalein being exposed to a purely oceanic weather regime and Darwin exhibiting land-sea interaction, we establish that the empirical measure for the convective variables conditioned on large-scale mid-level vertical velocities for the two locations are close. This allows us to train the stochastic models at one location and then generate time series of convective activity at the other location. The proposed stochastic subgrid-scale models adequately reproduce the statistics of the observed convective variables and we discuss how they may be used in future scale-independent mass-flux convection parameterisations.\n",

The London Model shows similar performance to its lower resolution equivalent at short lead times, but improved performance at longer lead times and an improved frequency bias of forecast fog events. Differences in the model cloud parametrization are the key reason for the differing behaviour, leading to systematically less cloud, colder night time minimum temperatures and therefore more fog in the London Model. Benefit of the enhanced resolution is also found, via an improved representation of how orographic variability enhances turbulence in the stable boundary layer.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe impact of variational data assimilation for predicting two heavy rainfall events that caused devastating floods in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia is studied using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. On 25 November 2009 and 26 January 2011, the city was deluged with more than double the annual rainfall amount caused by convective storms. We used a high resolution, two-way nested domain WRF model to simulate the two rainfall episodes. Simulations include control runs initialized with National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System (GFS) data and 3-Dimensional Variational (3DVAR) data assimilation experiments conducted by assimilating NCEP prepbufr and radiance observations. Observations from Automated Weather Stations (AWS), synoptic charts, radar reflectivity and satellite pictures from the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia are used to assess the forecasting results. To evaluate the impact of the different assimilated observational datasets on the simulation of the major flooding event of 2009, we conducted 3DVAR experiments assimilating individual sources and a combination of all data sets. Results suggest that while the control run had a tendency to predict the storm earlier than observed, the assimilation of profile observations greatly improved the model's thermodynamic structure and lead to better representation of simulated rainfall both in timing and amount. The experiment with assimilation of all available observations compared best with observed rainfall in terms of timing of the storm and rainfall distribution, demonstrating the importance of assimilating different types of observations. Retrospective experiments with and without data assimilation, for three different model lead times (48, 72 and 96-h), were performed to examine the skill of WRF model to predict the heavy rainfall events. Quantitative rainfall analysis of these simulations suggests that 48-h lead time runs with assimilation of all observational data provide best statistical scores.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSpectral integration is the most time consuming part of solar radiative transfer codes used in numerical weather prediction. Routinely used approaches usually incline to one of two extremes \u2013 expensive and very accurate correlated k-distribution method made affordable by doing radiative transfer calculations with reduced temporal and/or spatial resolution, or cheaper but less accurate broadband approach affordable at every grid-point and time-step. Both approaches have their pros and cons, but hybrid solutions do not seem very promising. The presented work improves accuracy of full spectrum broadband approach by parameterizing secondary saturation of gaseous absorption, optical saturation of Rayleigh scattering and of cloud absorption as well as non-random gas-cloud spectral overlap. In order to isolate the problem of spectral integration from other approximations, one builds a narrowband reference using the same delta-two stream framework as the broadband scheme. Using this reference reveals the surprising fact that saturation effect of cloud absorption for one single layer and for the whole solar spectrum can be parameterized in a rather compact way, with one simple formula for liquid clouds and one for ice clouds. One then introduces the concept of effective cloud optical depth, which extends the applicability of parameterized cloud optical saturation to multi-layer cases, accommodating also effects of gas-cloud spectral overlap in the near-infrared. A scheme with all the above parameterizations indeed pushes accuracy limits of broadband approach to the level where a single shortwave interval can be used. This opens the possibility to reduce costs by using selective intermittency, where slowly evolving gaseous transmissions are updated on the timescale of hours, while quickly varying cloud optical properties are recomputed at every model time-step. In a companion paper it will be demonstrated that the above core strategy is applicable also to thermal radiative transfer, with perhaps even better cost effectiveness there.\n",

Since many geophysical variables follow a lognormal distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution, a mixed lognormal and Gaussian distribution data assimilation scheme is implemented in the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) one-dimensional optimal estimation (C1DOE) retrieval system to model the background errors associated with the temperature as a Gaussian and those with respect to mixing ratio as lognormal. The new mixed distribution is compared against the traditional Gaussian configuration and a logarithmic transformation for the water vapor mixing ratio for two situations: 1) synthetic brightness temperatures generated from a lognormal distribution and 2) Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) observations from the month of September 2005 over the west Pacific where a lognormal signal for moisture had previously been detected. It is shown for Case 1 that given a consistent apriori state for a lognormal distribution then the lognormal distribution-based retrieval is the best at inverting the true state back. For Case 2 the final innovations are smallest for the mixed distribution scheme. The retrieval values are compared against Microwave Surface and Precipitation Products System (MSPPS), and the lognormal approach is consistently closer to the values compared to these other two approaches.\n",

In this work it is documented how flow-dependent ensemble information from the ECMWF EDA has gradually been incorporated into the B model which describes the background error covariance matrix at the start of the ECMWF 4D-Var assimilation window. Starting with background error variances for the balanced part of the control vector and observation quality control (Bonavita et al., 2012) the current paper extends the flow-dependency to background error variances for the unbalanced part of the control vector and for background error correlation structures. The correlations are determined either online from previous days or from a hybrid of climatological and current cycle estimates. Each of these changes is shown to improve both the realism of the modelled B and the accuracy of the analysis and forecast fields produced by the 4D-Var assimilation cycle which makes use of the improved B. Finally, increasing the resolution at which the EDA 4D-Vars are run is shown to reduce the underestimation of the EDA-based error estimates.\n",

A cyclone track database of extended October to March winters was obtained from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Large positive correlation is found between winter cyclone counts and local sample mean vorticity over the exit region of the North Atlantic storm track in this cyclone track database. Conversely, negative correlation is found over the Gulf stream. Possible causes for the dependence are investigated by regressing winter cyclone counts and local sample mean vorticity on teleconnection indices with Poisson and linear models. The indices for the Scandinavian pattern, North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic Pattern are able to account for most of the observed positive correlation over the North Atlantic. To consider the implications of frequency intensity dependence for the insurance industry an aggregate risk metric was used as a proxy for the annual aggregate insured loss. Here the aggregate risk is defined as the sum of the intensities of all events occurring within a season. Assuming independence between the frequency and intensity results in large biases in the variance and the extremes of the aggregate risk, especially over Scandinavia. Therefore including frequency intensity dependence in extratropical cyclone loss models is necessary to model the risk of extreme losses.\n",

An Arabian winter monsoon index (AWMI) is defined to highlight the Arabian Peninsula as the most representative region for the northern hemispheric winter rainfall. The observations show that the rainfall variability is relatively large over the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula. The correlation coefficient between the Ni\u00f1o3.4 index and rainfall in this region is 0.33, statistically significant at 90% level, suggesting potentially some modest predictability, and indicating that El Ni\u00f1o increases and La Ni\u00f1a decreases the rainfall. Regression analysis shows that upper-level cyclonic circulation anomalies that are forced by El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are responsible for the winter rainfall anomalies over the Arabian region. The stronger (weaker) mean transient eddy activity related to the upper-level trough induced by the warm (cold) SSTs during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) tends to increase (decrease) the rainfall in the region. The model hindcast dataset reproduces the ENSO-rainfall connection. The seasonal mean predictability of northeast Arabian rainfall index is 0.35, statistically significant at 95% level. It is shown that the noise variance is larger than the signal over the Arabian Peninsula region, which tends to limit the prediction skill. The potential predictability is generally increased in ENSO years and is, in particular, larger during La Ni\u00f1a compared to El Ni\u00f1o years in the region. Furthermore, central Pacific ENSO events and ENSO events with weak signals in the Indian Ocean tend to increase predictability over the Arabian region.\n",

The constrained spectral radiance matching (CSRM) algorithm assigns donor columns observed by CloudSat/CALIPSO to recipient pixels across MODIS imagery. The column meeting the constraint is selected as a donor via spectral radiance matching (SRM). Results are compared using eight cloud characteristics, retrieved from passive imagery, as constraints and distinct values for a matching controlling factor \u03b1. Cloud top pressure and \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.3 are used in the final algorithm. Estimates are made of CBH and layer cloud fraction profile made by SRM, CSRM, cloud-type matching (CTM), and retrieved data matching (RDM) using a data-exclusion procedure. Results show that the CSRM is superior at estimating lowest CBH and layer cloud fraction. It is also shown that when cloud-types are provided by merged CloudSat and CALIPSO data, the CTM provides the best estimates of uppermost CBH, with the CSRM taking second. Both the CSRM method and the straight SRM method construct layer cloud fraction profiles very well for clouds between 2 km and ~15 km.

Previous numerical modelling studies that investigate the effects of boundary-layer rolls and the processes that control their dynamics have relied upon high-resolution, idealised simulations. Recently, however, numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have increased in horizontal resolution to the point at which they are capable of explicitly resolving shallow convective circulations. Therefore, there is a need to assess the ability of NWP to accurately forecast the formation, development and breakup of boundary-layer rolls. Here, we assess the ability of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM), the NWP component of the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS), to simulate the life cycle of boundary-layer rolls. A suite of simulations is performed, over a range of horizontal resolutions, of boundary-layer rolls observed across Victoria, Australia, on Black Saturday, 7th February 2009. In this case, it is found that a horizontal grid spacing of less than 0.6\u2009km is required to adequately reproduce the scale and evolution of the observed rolls. We note that the boundary layer was particularly deep on this day and as a consequence the boundary-layer rolls were wider than may be typically observed, meaning the grid spacing specified here lies at the upper end of what would be required with a shallower boundary layer. The model output is used to assess how the boundary-layer rolls contribute to the high fire danger on Black Saturday. It is suggested that boundary-layer rolls may increase fire danger by (i) causing wind-direction variability at the surface, which increases the rate of spread of fires; and (ii) enhancing the process of long-range spotting by augmenting the vertical lofting of embers.\n",

In this contribution, the evolution of error growth in a case study of this forecast error type is diagnosed through analysis of operational forecasts and hindcast simulations. Potential vorticity (PV) on the 320-K isentropic surface is used to diagnose Rossby waves. The Rossby-wave forecast error in the operational ECMWF high-resolution forecast is shown to be associated with errors in the forecast of a warm conveyor belt (WCB) through trajectory analysis and an error metric for WCB outflows. The WCB forecast error is characterised by an overestimation of WCB amplitude, a location of the WCB outflow regions that is too far to the southeast, and a resulting underestimation of the magnitude of the negative PV anomaly in the outflow. Essentially the same forecast error development also occurred in all members of the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System and the Met Office MOGREPS-15 suggesting that in this case model error made an important contribution to the development of forecast error in addition to initial condition error. Exploiting this forecast error robustness, a comparison was performed between the realised flow evolution, proxied by a sequence of short-range simulations, and a contemporaneous forecast. Both the proxy to the realised flow and the contemporaneous forecast a were produced with the Met Office Unified Model enhanced with tracers of diabatic processes modifying potential temperature and PV. Clear differences were found in the way potential temperature and PV are modified in the WCB between proxy and forecast.

        "description": "\n\nUsing lessons from idealised predictability experiments, we discuss some issues and perspectives on the design of operational seasonal to inter-annual Arctic sea-ice prediction systems. We first review the opportunities to use a hierarchy of different types of experiment to learn about the predictability of Arctic climate. We also examine key issues for ensemble system design, such as: measuring skill, the role of ensemble size and generation of ensemble members. When assessing the potential skill of a set of prediction experiments, using more than one metric is essential as different choices can significantly alter conclusions about the presence or lack of skill. We find that increasing both the number of hindcasts and ensemble size is important for reliably assessing the correlation and expected error in forecasts. For other metrics, such as dispersion, increasing ensemble size is most important. Probabilistic measures of skill can also provide useful information about the reliability of forecasts. In addition, various methods for generating the different ensemble members are tested. The range of techniques can produce surprisingly different ensemble spread characteristics. The lessons learnt should help inform the design of future operational prediction systems.\n",

Condensation is prescribed to occur whenever the moisture at a point exceeds a prescribed saturation value. It is seen that a slow condensation time scale is required to obtain a consistent set of equations at leading order. Further, since the advecting wind fields are geostrophic, changes in moisture (and hence, precipitation) occur only via non-divergent mechanisms. Following observations, a saturation profile with gradients in the zonal and meridional directions is prescribed. A purely meridional gradient has the effect of slowing down the dry Rossby waves, through a reduction in the \u201cequivalent gradient\" of the background potential vorticity. A large scale unstable moist mode results on the inclusion of a zonal gradient by itself, or in conjunction with a meridional moisture gradient. For gradients that are are representative of the atmosphere, the most unstable moist mode propagates zonally in the direction of increasing moisture, matures over an intraseasonal timescale and has small phase speed.\n",

A station located in Laverton (less urbanised area), which is 17\u2009km south-west of Melbourne CBD, was selected as the reference station for the computation of UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD. Using daily minimum/maximum temperatures at the two stations, nocturnal/diurnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD were computed for the period 1952\u20132010. It was found that in Melbourne CBD, nocturnal UHI intensities show a clear rising trend over the period 1952\u20132010 unlike the diurnal UHI intensities. For the analysis of nocturnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD, under changing climate, for each calendar month statistical models based on the gene expression programming (GEP) technique were developed for downscaling GCM outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at Melbourne CBD and Laverton. Using the outputs of HadCM3, GFDL2.0 and ECHAM5 pertaining to A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario on the downscaling models, projections of monthly average minimum temperature were produced for the two stations over the period 2000\u20132099. In each season, at both stations, the ensemble average of monthly minimum temperature gradually increased over the period 2000\u20132099. The ensemble average UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD projected into the future was higher for all seasons in comparison to that of period 1952\u20131971. Downscaling models based on the GEP technique were developed for each calendar month for projecting the number of very hot days in November \u2013 March and very cold days in May \u2013 September in Melbourne CBD.

One of the key elements of the former is stochastic physics, schemes that perturb some uncertain processes in a GCM such as physical parametrizations or diffusion. They help to increase the ensemble dispersion of Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) and in some cases improve certain atmospheric processes by noise-induced drifts. We have developed a new configuration of stochastic physics schemes for the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). It consists of an improved Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter v2 (SKEB2), plus the Stochastic Perturbation of Tendencies (SPT).\nThe improvements to SKEB2 remove spurious physical artifacts, e.g. a spurious wave caused by low wavenumber perturbations, and improve the resolution-sensitivity of the scheme. The SPT produces a larger ensemble spread in the tropics than present schemes, but its impact on long-term climate budgets makes the use of conservation constrains for watervapour and energy essential.\nThe new configuration produces a higher impact in the tropics, increasing the ensemble spread and improving some long-standing climate biases in areas of excessive convection, whilst minimizing the negative impact on tropical processes like tropical convective waves.\n",

The cloud properties are also evaluated using the observational simulator package COSP, a synthetic brightness temperature model (SBTM) and the cloud liquid water path data from University of Wisconsin (Uwisc) satellite retrievals. All of these evaluations are focused on the Southern Ocean area in an effort to understand the reasons behind the shortwave radiation biases at the surface. It is found that the model overestimates the high-level cloud fraction and frequency of occurrence of small ice water content and underestimates the middle and low level cloud fraction and water content.\nIn order to improve the modeled radiation fields over the Southern Ocean area, two main modifications have been made to the physical schemes in the ACCESS model. Firstly the autoconversion rate at which the cloud water is converted into rain and the accretion rate in the warm rain scheme have been modified which increases the cloud liquid water content in warm cloud layers. Secondly, the scheme which determines the fraction of supercooled liquid water in mixed-phase clouds in the parameterization of cloud optical properties has been changed to use one derived from CALIPSO data which provides larger liquid cloud fractions and thus higher optical depths than the default scheme. Sensitivity tests of these two schemes in ACCESS climate runs have shown that applying either can lead to a reduction of the solar radiation reaching the surface and reduce the shortwave radiation biases.\n",

The forecasts showed a bifurcation in the track of Nadine \u2013 a significant fraction predicting its landfall over the Iberian Peninsula \u2013 and a high spread in the synoptic conditions downstream. The forecast uncertainty was a major issue for planning observations during the first special observation period (SOP1) of the Hydrological cycle in Mediterranean eXperiment (HyMeX). Clustering the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reveals two scenarios for the interaction between Nadine and an Atlantic cutoff, which controls both the track of Nadine and the synoptic conditions downstream. The observed scenario of weak interaction is characterized by Nadine moving westward and the cutoff moving eastward. The cutoff then triggers precipitation over the C\u00e9vennes in southeastern France. The contrasting scenario of strong interaction is characterized by Nadine and the cutoff rotating around each other over the Atlantic. Nadine then either merges with the cutoff or makes landfall over the Iberian Peninsula. The interaction between Nadine and the cutoff mimics the vortex-vortex interaction previously observed between two tropical cyclones or two upper-level vortices. It differs from the usual interaction between a tropical cyclone and a larger trough during extratropical transition. A critical distance of about 1000\u2009km between Nadine and the cutoff distinguishes the cases of weak and strong interaction in the ensemble forecast. Shifting the initial position of Nadine in Meso-NH numerical experiments confirms the critical distance and suggests a bifurcation point in the relative position of Nadine and the cutoff. The high forecast sensitivity to the vortex-vortex interaction resulted in the lowest predictability over the Mediterranean during the whole HyMeX SOP1.\n",

This paper describes the development of a simple parameterization scheme to remedy this problem. The scheme estimates the increase in the grid-box mean cloud liquid water mixing ratio which would result from vertical displacements produced by the unresolved hills, accounting for regions where the actual surface is both higher and lower than the model surface. Using idealized two-dimensional simulations of neutrally stratified flow over a Gaussian shaped ridge resolved to varying degrees, the new scheme was shown to increase the total (resolved plus parameterized) orographic water towards that produced over a well-resolved hill, with good agreement for a wide range of hill sizes. This sub-grid orographic water can be used by a microphysics parameterization scheme to enhance the growth of rain (or snow) via accretion. In simulations with a constant rain rate into the top of the domain, the surface orographic rain rate was increased over a small completely sub-grid hill by up to 90%, giving much better agreement with the simulations over a well-resolved hill. The scheme also increases the rain produced by flow over large sub-grid mountains if the resolved cloud is able to produce some rain via autoconversion.\n",

Imager and sounder are two primary meteorological instruments aboard INSAT-3D satellite. Pre-assimilation monitoring of the radiances has been carried out from April to July 2014. A double difference technique using HIRS on MetOp-A is employed to remove the effect of deficiencies in the model analyzed profiles which can contribute to the biases. Observed radiances of both instruments appear to be colder (~1.5 to 2\u2009K) with respect to radiative transfer model (RTM) simulated radiances, except water vapour channel radiances that are warmer (0.5 to 1\u2009K). The standard deviations of observed minus RTM simulated radiances are between 0.5 and 1.5\u2009K. Prior to data assimilation, these biases are corrected using variational bias correction scheme. Largest impacts on the analyses, when assimilating imager radiances, are found in the mid and upper tropospheric moisture, while assimilation of sounder radiances impacted both moisture and temperature throughout the troposphere. The more accurate analyses with the INSAT-3D radiances assimilation lead to improved moisture, wind, temperature and precipitation forecasts compared to control case in which only conventional observations were assimilated. The results demonstrate the ability of temperature and water vapour sensitive radiances to improve not only the temperature and moisture fields, but also the wind fields, enhances their importance, particularly over tropical regions where wind observations are more important.\n",

These changes over land and ocean are spatially coherent and comprise of a rearrangement of very wet regions and a systematic expansion of dry zones. While the increased likelihood of extremes is consistent with a higher average temperature during the pause (as compared to 1979\u20131997), it is important to note that the periods considered are also characterized by a transition from a relatively warm to cold phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To further probe the relation between contrasting phases of ENSO and extremes in accumulation, a similar comparison is performed between 1960\u20131978 (another extended cold phase of ENSO) and the aforementioned warming era. Though limited by land-only observations, in this cold-to-warm transition, remarkably, a near-exact reversal of extremes is noted both statistically and geographically. This is despite the average temperature being higher in 1979\u20131997 as compared to 1960\u20131978. Taken together, we propose that there is a fundamental mode of natural variability, involving the waxing and waning of extremes in accumulation of global tropical rainfall with different phases of ENSO.\n",

Results show that the five reanalysis datasets can generally reproduce the climatology and interannual variability of EASM precipitation. Especially, the MERRA and ERA-Interim have the highest skills. Considering different-class precipitation, large uncertainties exist in the category of non-rainfall and heavy rainfall. The five reanalysis datasets overestimate the non-rainfall frequency, and the JRA25 and NCEP2 overestimate the heavy rainfall frequency. The well-known inter-decadal variation around mid-1990s can also be better depicted by ERA-Interim and MERRA. For linear trend of precipitation, only the MERRA can reasonably reproduce the increasing tendency over southern China and western Pacific and the decreasing tendency over Indo-China Peninsula. Based on the EOF analysis, the spatial-temporal structure of EASM precipitation has been examined. The MERRA, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim can better capture both the spatial patterns and principle components of first two EOF modes. Based on our evaluation, the preferential reanalysis datasets for investigating the EASM precipitation are the ERA-Interim and MERRA, which also permit the more precise investigations of interannual to decadal variability.\n",

Numerical simulations are performed with two state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models (i. e.

With this set-up, the sensitivity of the model results to horizontal grid spacing and terrain elevation is assessed. Furthermore, model outputs are compared to observations from rain gauges, radars, and radiosondes, made during the campaign. Although the higher-resolution runs show a higher correlation to observed precipitation, the influence of model grid spacing on total precipitation amount or timing is rather weak. Since the overall performance of both mesoscale models is fairly good, they are used together to investigate the physical processes characterising IOP 13. In particular, the differences in the location and timing of convection between the simulations are used to identify and explore the processes that need to be well represented in order to reproduce adequately the mechanisms initiating heavy precipitation in the Mediterranean region.\n",

These methods have not yet been applied to the land surface component of models. Since the land surface is strongly coupled to the atmospheric state at certain times and in certain places (such as the European summer of 2003), improvements in the representation of land surface uncertainty may potentially lead to improvements in atmospheric forecasts for such events.\nHere we analyse seasonal retrospective forecasts for 1981\u20132012 performed with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\u2019 (ECMWF) coupled ensemble forecast model. We consider two methods of incorporating uncertainty into the land surface model (H-TESSEL): stochastic perturbation of tendencies, and static perturbation of key soil parameters.\nWe find that the perturbed parameter approach considerably improves the forecast of extreme air temperature for summer 2003, through better representation of negative soil moisture anomalies and upward sensible heat flux. Averaged across all the reforecasts the perturbed parameter experiment shows relatively little impact on the mean bias, suggesting perturbations of at least this magnitude can be applied to the land surface without any degradation of model climate. There is also little impact on skill averaged across all reforecasts and some evidence of overdispersion for soil moisture.\nThe stochastic tendency experiments show a large overdispersion for the soil temperature fields, indicating that the perturbation here is too strong. There is also some indication that the forecast of the 2003 warm event is improved for the stochastic experiments, however the improvement is not as large as observed for the perturbed parameter experiment.\n",

One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical modeling simulations is self-aggregation, a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influence of domain geometry on the mechanisms, growth rates, and length scales of self-aggregation of tropical convection. We simulate radiative-convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), in a non-rotating, highly-elongated 3D channel domain of length >\u2009104 km, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea-surface temperature varying from 280\u2009K to 310\u2009K. Convection self-aggregates into multiple moist and dry bands across this full range of temperatures. As convection aggregates, we find a decrease in upper-tropospheric cloud fraction, but an increase in lower-tropospheric cloud fraction; this sensitivity of clouds to aggregation agrees with observations in the upper troposphere, but not in the lower troposphere. An advantage of the channel geometry is that a separation distance between convectively active regions can be defined; we present a theory for this distance based on boundary layer remoistening. We find that surface fluxes and radiative heating act as positive feedbacks, favoring self-aggregation, but advection of moist static energy acts as a negative feedback, opposing self-aggregation, for nearly all temperatures and times. Early in the process of self-aggregation, surface fluxes are a positive feedback at all temperatures, shortwave radiation is a strong positive feedback at low surface temperatures but weakens at higher temperatures, and longwave radiation is a negative feedback at low temperatures but becomes a positive feedback for temperatures greater than 295\u2013300\u2009K. Clouds contribute strongly to the radiative feedbacks, especially at low temperatures.\n",

The system assimilates a wide variety of ocean and atmospheric observations and produces ocean-atmosphere analyses with a coupled model. Employing the coupled model constraint in the analysis implies that assimilation of an ocean observation has immediate impact on the atmospheric state estimate, and, conversely, assimilation of an atmospheric observation affects the ocean state. This covariance between atmosphere and ocean induced by the analysis method is illustrated with simple numerical experiments. Realistic data assimilation experiments based on the global observing system are then used to assess the quality of the assimilation method.

Predictability is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), estimated here from the difference of pairs of ensemble forecasts, conditioned on one of the forecast variables (the \u201cpseudo-observation\u201d) exceeding a threshold.\nUsing an exchangeable linear regression model for pairs of forecast variables, we show that the MSE can be decomposed into the sum of three terms: a threshold-independent constant, a mean term that always increases with threshold, and a variance term that can either increase, decrease, or stay constant with threshold. Using the Generalised Pareto Distribution to model wind speed excesses over a threshold, we show that MSE always increases with threshold at sufficiently high threshold. However, MSE can be a decreasing function of threshold at lower thresholds but only if the forecasts have finite upper bounds.\nThe methods are illustrated by application to daily wind speed forecasts for London made using the 24 member Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System from 1 Jan 2009 to 31 May 2011. For this example, the mean term increases faster than the variance term decreases with increasing threshold, and so predictability decreases for more extreme events.\n",

The meteorological analysis builds upon past studies of the diurnal cycle in the region by incorporating diurnal cycles of lower tropospheric wind profiles, thermodynamic profiles, integrated water vapour and liquid water measurements, and cloud radar measurements of frequency and location. These meteorological measurements are complemented by 3-hour measurements of the diurnal cycles of the TOA and surface shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative fluxes and cloud radiative effects (CREs), and the atmospheric radiative flux divergence (RFD) and atmospheric CREs. Cirrus cloudiness during the dry season is shown to peak in coverage in the afternoon, while convective clouds during the wet season are shown to peak near dawn and have an afternoon minimum related to the rise of the Lifting Condensation Level into the Saharan Air Layer. The LW and SW RFDs and CREs exhibit diurnal cycles during both seasons, but there is a relatively small difference in the LW cycles during the two seasons (depending on the variable and time of day). Small differences in the TOA CREs during the two seasons are overwhelmed by large differences in the surface SW CREs, which exceed. A significant surface SW CRE during the wet season combined with a negligible TOA SW CRE produces a diurnal cycle in the atmospheric CRE that is modulated primarily by the SW surface CRE, peaks at midday at , and varies widely from day to day.\n",

The relative user characteristic (RUC) curve and the quantile value plot allow analysing the performance of a forecast for a specific user in a decision-making framework. The RUC curve is designed as a user-based discrimination tool and the quantile value plot translates forecast discrimination ability in terms of economic value. The relationship between the overall value of a quantile forecast and the respective quantile skill score is also discussed.

More specifically the contribution of moisture advection, evaporation of rain and surface fluxes to the moisture budget over particular regions of the domain is investigated. This is done both for a continental case and an oceanic case although both cases show a very similar behaviour. The accumulation of moisture in confined regions of the sub-cloud layer that constitute preferred locations for future cloud development mainly results from the advection of moisture. The latter contributes to \u223c86 %, minor evaporation of precipitation contributes to \u223c4 %, whereas surface moisture fluxes yield \u223c11 % in the continental case. In the oceanic case advection contributes to \u223c125 %, surface moisture fluxes to \u223c-32 % and evaporation of precipitation to \u223c7 %.\nTo further identify the origin of the advected moisture additional scalars marking moisture originating from the surface and from the evaporation of rain are introduced into the model. It is seen that the surface moisture and the evaporated rain water that were released within the last two hours only make 55 % of the moisture accumulated in the moist patches in the land case, the rest stemming from older moisture. In the ocean case this share increases to 72 %. The contribution of recently released moisture drops to 28 % at cloud base in the continental case and to 56 % in the ocean case. The contribution at cloud base is dominated by surface fluxes, the evaporation of rain is negligible.\n",

The ensembles are perturbed with a stochastic kinetic-energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS) and started from identical initial conditions. Scale-dependent error growth is investigated by imposing stochastic perturbations with various spatial scales on the TC and its environment. Predictability limits (upper bound) are determined by computing the error magnitude associated with each component of the Fourier-decomposed TC wind fields at forecast times up to 7 days. Three SKEBS ensembles with different perturbation scales are used to investigate the effects of small-scale, mesoscale and large-scale uncertainties on the predictability of TC intensity. In addition, the influence of the environmental flow is investigated by perturbing the lateral boundary conditions. It is found that forecast errors grow rapidly on small scales (azimuthal wavenumbers\u2009>\u200920), which saturate within 6\u201312\u2009h in all four ensembles, regardless of perturbation scale. Errors grow relatively slower on scales corresponding to rainbands (wavenumbers 2\u20135), limiting the predictability of these features to 1\u20135 days. Earl's mean vortex and the wavenumber 1 asymmetry are comparatively resistant to error growth and remain predictable for at least 7 days. Forecast uncertainty of the mean vortex and wavenumber 1 asymmetry is greater in the large-scale perturbation and perturbed lateral boundary condition ensembles. The results from this case indicate that the predictability of the mean vortex and wavenumber 1 asymmetry is predominately associated with the predictability of the large-scale environment, which is generally much longer than that of convective-scale processes within the TC.\n",

Both cyclones were associated with extreme rainfall covering a large part of the western Mediterranean Sea, where 24-h accumulated precipitation measurements exceeded 150\u2009mm. We combine complementary observations from airborne radar and lidar systems, ZEUS lightning detection network and meteorological surface stations along with satellite diagnostics on deep convection, for a detailed microphysics and (thermo-)dynamical analysis of the two extreme rainfall cases. In addition, we use operational analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for analyzing the synoptic conditions and diagnosing strongly ascending air masses in the vicinity of the cyclones, so-called warm conveyor belts (WCBs). The analysis revealed the different physical characteristics of the two cyclones responsible for the extreme rainfalls. Both cyclones were associated with a WCB and a comma cloud, but deep convection, intense lightning and very cold cloud tops occurred only for the first case while the second cyclone was mostly associated with stratiform rainfall, a strong WCB, and only few embedded cells of deep convection.\n",

This shift to a probabilistic approach enabled a better extraction of predictive signals at longer lead times and provided a meaningful framework for extending the forecast length beyond 10 days. In this work, the limit of predictive skill is assessed for ECMWF monthly ensemble forecasts at different spatial and temporal scales. The forecast skill horizon is defined as the lead time when the ensemble ceases to be more skilful than a climatological distribution, using a continuous ranked probability score as metric. Results based on 32-day ensemble forecasts indicate that the forecast skill horizon is sensitive to the spatial and temporal scale of the predicted phenomena, to the variable considered and the area analysed. On average over 1 year of forecast, the forecast skill horizon for instantaneous, grid-point fields is between 16\u201323 days, while it is considerably longer for time- and spatial-average fields. Forecast skill horizons longer than the 2 weeks that were thought to be the limit are now achievable thanks to major advances in numerical weather prediction. More specifically, they are possible because forecasts are now framed in probabilistic terms, with a probability distribution estimated using ensembles generated using forecast models that include more components (e.g. a dynamical ocean and ocean waves) and more faithfully represent processes. Moreover, the forecasts start from more accurate initial conditions constructed using better data-assimilation methods and more observational data.\n",

In the first Lagrangian, the flow is formulated in terms of fluid particles, but conservation of mass and entropy is assumed a priori. In the second Lagrangian, the flow is described by fields, and conservation of mass and entropy is obtained with Lagrange multipliers. The third Lagrangian is also based on a field formulation, but has no Lagrange multipliers and produces all the desired equations of motion, including conservation of mass and entropy.

The use of a reference frame moving with the disturbance gives a more accurate depiction of streamlines and closed circulation than the Earth-relative frame. Identification of recirculating regions does not require a choice of reference frame, however, when marked by the Galilean invariant Eulerian Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter. While the Eulerian OW parameter is generally effective at identifying vortex cores at a given place and a given time, it has its limitations in weak disturbances and in time-dependent flows. Integrating the eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor along particle trajectories provides a time-smoothing of the Eulerian OW parameter, and provides earlier detection with fewer false alarms. We refer to this integration along trajectories as the Lagrangian Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter. When mapped to a horizontal grid it becomes a Lagrangian OW field.\nThe Lagrangian OW field has advantages over the Eulerian OW field in the detail of additional flow structures that it identifies. The Lagrangian OW field shows the Lagrangian boundaries that are present as a disturbance develops from an easterly wave, and a shear sheath that forms when a disturbance becomes self-sustaining, typically at tropical storm strength. Since all of these structures are Lagrangian, they are advected with the flow field, and display the continuous evolution of coherent flow features as the fluid evolves.\nExamples of the use of the Lagrangian OW field are given for ECMWF forecast data from the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. All of the Lagrangian coherent structures that can be identified by this field are shown for developing disturbances and mature cyclones. The Lagrangian OW field also shows additional details of vortex mergers, and is used to identify a stable crystal lattice configuration in which vorticity does not aggregate.\n",

To isolate the role of surface ET, quasi-idealized simulations down to 1.2\u2009km grid spacing were conducted, where over the Amazon lowlands (AMZL) and at every time step the surface sensible heat effects are exactly identical to the realistic reference runs while surface latent heat fluxes are prevented from entering the atmosphere. The results show that, without surface ET, daily precipitation within the AMZL decreases by as much as ~75%, but nearly doubles over the surrounding mountainous regions. This dramatic influence is attributed to a dipole structure of convergence-divergence anomalies over the AMZL, primarily due to the considerable cooling of the troposphere associated with suppressed convection. Further examination of moist static energy evolution indicates that the net decrease in convective available potential energy over the AMZL is due to the removal of surface ET that is only partially compensated by related regional circulation changes. Because of the concave shape of the Andean mountain range, enhanced low-level divergence promotes air mass accumulation to the east of the central EADS. This perturbation becomes sufficiently strong around nightfall and produces significant eastward low-level pressure gradient force, rendering stronger winds away from the Andes. Moisture convergence and convection over the EADS vary accordingly, strengthened in the day but attenuated at night. Nocturnal convective motion is, however, more widespread. Analytical solutions of simplified diagnostic equations of convective fraction suggest that reduction of lower troposphere evaporation is the driving mechanism. Additional exploratory experiments with varied surface ET magnitude demonstrate that the connection between the AMZL ET and EADS precipitation is robust.\n",

Three reanalyses were performed, each assimilating a varying amount of seal data whilst holding all other conditions constant.\nAssimilation of both temperature and salinity profiles from mammals has a detrimental effect on the model's temperature and salinity fields due to a high bias in the salinity values. Restricting assimilation to temperature profiles only has benefits for both temperature and salinity fields in regions of the ocean where seals are sampling, improving root mean square error statistics by between 1% and 6% compared to the case where no mammal data were assimilated. In addition, the assimilation of seal temperature profiles alters the mixed layer depth and re-positions and increases gradients of some fronts compared to the no seals case.\n",

The vertical distribution of cloud and precipitation during the WAM are evaluated in Met Office Unified Model simulations against CloudSat observations. Simulations were run at 40-km and 12-km horizontal grid length using a convection parameterization scheme and at 12-km, 4-km, and 1.5-km grid length with the convection scheme effectively switched off, to study the impact of model resolution and convection parameterization scheme on the organisation of tropical convection. Radar reflectivity is forward-modelled from the model cloud fields using the CloudSat simulator to present a like-with-like comparison with the CloudSat radar observations. The representation of cloud and precipitation at 12-km horizontal grid length improves dramatically when the convection parameterization is switched off, primarily because of a reduction in daytime (moist) convection. Further improvement is obtained when reducing model grid length to 4 km or 1.5 km, especially in the representation of thin anvil and mid-level cloud, but three issues remain in all model configurations. Firstly, all simulations underestimate the fraction of anvils with cloud top height above 12 km, which can be attributed to too low ice water contents in the model compared to satellite retrievals. Secondly, the model consistently detrains mid-level cloud too close to the freezing level, compared to higher altitudes in CloudSat observations. Finally, there is too much low-level cloud cover in all simulations and this bias was not improved when adjusting the rainfall parameters in the microphysics scheme. To improve model simulations of the WAM, more detailed and in-situ observations of the dynamics and microphysics targeting these non-precipitating cloud types are required.\n",

We identify a pervasive issue in archived observations from surface stations, wherein the use of varying conventions for units and precision has led to distorted distributions of the data. Apart from the original precision being generally unknown, the majority of archived temperature data are found to be misaligned with the original measurements because of rounding on a Fahrenheit scale, conversion to Celsius, and re-rounding. Furthermore, we show that commonly-used statistical methods including quantile regression are sensitive to the finite precision and to double-rounding of the data after unit conversion. To remedy these issues, we present a Hidden Markov Model that uses the differing frequencies of specific recorded values to recover the most likely original precision and units associated with each observation. This precision-decoding algorithm is used to infer the precision of the 644 million daily surface temperature observations in the Global Historical Climate Network database, providing more accurate values for the 63% of samples found to have been biased by double-rounding. The average absolute bias correction across the dataset is 0.018\u2218C, and the average inferred precision is 0.41\u2218C, even though data are archived at 0.1\u2218C precision. These results permit for better inference of when record temperatures occurred, correction of rounding effects, and identification of inhomogeneities in surface temperature time series, amongst other applications. The precision-decoding algorithm is generally applicable to rounded observations \u2014 including surface pressure, humidity, precipitation, and other temperature data \u2014 thereby offering the potential to improve quality control procedures for many datasets.\n",

Two criterion, namely deep convection (DC) and convective overshooting (COV), are computed using the water vapour channels of the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS). Special attention is paid to the COV as it is associated with particularly severe weather. For the first time, the COV criterion was assessed in the Mediterranean, using two case studies conjointly observed by the airborne Rasta radar and MHS. COV is characterised by high ice water content (up to 2\u2009g.m\u2212\u20093) in the mid and upper troposphere (up to 12.5\u2009km in the stratosphere).During the SOP-1, DC and COV occurred about 0.1 % and 0.03 % of the total observation time, respectively. The Atlantic weather regimes appear to affect the temporal distribution of these convective events. Most of the DC and COV occurrences were found along the western coasts of Italy and Greece, mainly during the 10\u201315 October and 25 October-3 November episodes. These two episodes, for which severe meteorological events (e.g., tornadoes) were reported, are significant when compared with the 2002\u20132013 climatology (above the 75th percentile). Both criterions are also employed to assess the current ability of the Meso-NH model to forecast severe convection using a model-to-satellite approach. The forecasted DC and COV are found to be highly correlated in time with the observations, but are strongly underestimated. This suggests that the model missed a significant part of the most intense convective events and their associated hazards and underlines the need for better characterisation of model uncertainties associated with severe convection.\n",

A high-resolution regional weather prediction model is used to analyze the three-dimensional wind field and the corresponding air mass transport induced by the mesoscale convective system. The squall line can be divided into a bow-shaped strong part with a continuous line of heavy convective precipitation and a weaker part exhibiting several isolated multi-cell storms. In the strong part, a deep and intense rear inflow jet occurs with relative wind speeds of 12\u201318\u2009m s\u2212\u20091. This part is also characterized by moderate to strong wind shear, in contrast to the weaker convective squall line part where a shallow cold pool surges under the potentially unstable presquall air.\nTo investigate the air mass transport along the squall line, in the model simulations passive fluid tracers are initialized in several vertical layers with different thermodynamic conditions. At the strong part of the squall line a very efficient vertical tracer transport occurs. Potentially warm low-level air is lifted from the lowermost 2\u2009km to the upper troposphere where an organized horizontal outflow is observed. The potentially coldest presquall air descends just in front of the updraft region and partly penetrates the convective precipitation area. In the weaker part of the squall line the potential instability is not significantly reduced because there the vertical air mass transport is less effective. Additionally, the passive tracers are used to analyze the composition of the cold pool which turns out to be a very heterogeneous mixture of descending postfrontal cold air and presquall air originating in different heights.\n",

A channel selection method based on optimal estimation theory is undertaken using a database of profiles with associated errors from the ECMWF numerical weather prediction model and the radiative transfer model ARTS under clear sky conditions. The main results indicate that, by increasing the number of channels within the oxygen absorption band around 60 GHz and within the water vapour absorption band at 183 GHz the accuracy of temperature and humidity retrievals in the troposphere and in the stratosphere (for temperature), would be noticeably improved when compared to present and planned microwave radiometers. The channels located in the absorption lines at 118 GHz and above 200 GHz do not bring significant additional information on atmospheric profiles under clear sky conditions, partly due to larger radiometric noises. With a set of 137 selected channels that contribute to 90 % of the total information content (measured by a Degree of Freedom for Signal) it is possible to achieve almost the same performance in terms of variance error reduction than with 276 candidate channels. Sensitivity studies to various prescribed quantities defining the channel selection have been undertaken in order to check the robustness of the conclusions. They show that none of the choices modifies the above findings.\n",

        "description": "\nMany Global Circulation Models (GCMs) exhibit a persistent bias in the 2m-temperature over the mid-latitude continents, present in short-range forecasts as well as long-term climate simulations. A number of hypotheses have been proposed, revolving around deficiencies in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere energy exchange, poorly resolved low-level boundary-layer clouds or misrepresentations of deep-convective storms.\nA common approach to evaluating model biases focuses on the model-mean state. However, this makes an unambiguous interpretation of the origins of a bias difficult, given that biases are the result of the superposition of impacts of clouds and land-surface deficiencies over multiple time steps. This paper presents a new methodology to objectively detect the role of clouds in the creation of a surface warm bias. A unique feature of this study is its focus on temperature-error growth at the time-step level.\nIt is shown that compositing the temperature-error growth by the coinciding bias in total downwelling radiation provides unambiguous evidence for the role that clouds play in the creation of the surface warm bias during certain portions of the day. Furthermore, the application of an objective cloud-regime classification allows for the detection of the specific cloud regimes that matter most for the creation of the bias.\nWe applied this method to two state-of-the-art GCMs that exhibit a distinct warm bias over the SGP. Our analysis highlights that in one GCM, biases in deep-convective and low-level clouds contribute most to the temperature-error growth in the afternoon and evening respectively. In the second GCM deep clouds persist too long in the evening leading to a growth of the temperature bias. The reduction of the temperature bias in both models in the morning and the growth of the bias in the second GCM in the afternoon could not be assigned to a cloud issue, but are more likely caused by a land-surface deficiency.\n",

During the NASA Orographic Clouds Experiment (NASA06) in 2006, two complex mountain flow cases were documented by the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft carrying aboard the Wyoming Cloud Radar.\nThe structure of turbulence and its intensity across the mountain range are described using the variance of vertical velocity \u03c3w2 and the cube root of the energy dissipation rate \u03b51/3, or EDR. For a quantitative analysis of turbulence from the cloud radar, the uncertainties in the Doppler wind retrieval have to be taken into account, such as the variance of hydrometeor fall speed and the contamination of vertical Doppler velocity by the horizontal wind. Thorough analysis of the uncertainties shows that 25% accuracy or better can be achieved in regions of moderate to severe turbulence in the lee of the mountains, while only qualitative estimates of turbulence intensity can be obtained outside of the most turbulent regions.\nTwo NASA06 events exhibiting large-amplitude mountain waves, mid-tropospheric wave breaking, and rotor circulations are examined . Moderate turbulence is found in a wave breaking region with \u03c3w2 and EDR reaching 4.8 m2s\u2212\u20092 and 0.25 m2/3s\u2212\u20091 , respectively. Severe turbulence is measured within the rotor circulations with \u03c3w2 and EDR respectively in the ranges of 7.8 \u2013 16.4 m2s\u2212\u20092 and 0.50 \u2013 0.77 m2/3s\u2212\u20091 .

Using an isentropic framework, a novel diagnostic based on the tendency equation for the slope of isentropic surfaces \u2013 a measure of the potential for baroclinic development \u2013 is presented. The tendency comprises contributions from dynamic processes, latent heat release, radiation, and sub-gridscale turbulence, which incorporates the effect of sensible heat fluxes. A climatology of these tendencies over the North Atlantic is compiled for the winters 2009 and 2010.\nIt is found that adiabatic tilting flattens the isentropic surfaces, reflecting the action of growing baroclinic cyclones. This tendency is climatologically balanced by the generation of slope by diabatic processes. In the lower troposphere, the most intense diabatic increase of slope is found along the oceanic frontal zone associated with the Gulf Stream and at higher latitudes in the Labrador Sea, the Nordic Seas and the Barents Sea. Latent heat release and sensible heat fluxes both contribute substantially in these regions. A quantitative analysis of cold air outbreaks emphasises their important role for restoring the slope in the lower troposphere over the Gulf Stream region and off the sea-ice edge at high latitudes. In the upper troposphere, latent heat release due to cloud microphysical processes is the dominant mechanism maintaining the slope.\n",

The ASWI is significantly correlated with the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel in the 1900\u20132013 period (r\u2009=\u2009+0.57, r\u2009=\u2009+0.66 and r\u2009=\u2009+0.53 for July, August and September respectively). By using historical wind direction measurements it has been possible to compute the ASWI back to 1790 for July and to 1839 for August and September, thus providing the first instrumental record of the West African Monsoon strength for a large portion of the 19th century.\nSince the 1970s, the Sahel has experienced a strong and persistent drought. During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel. Notwithstanding, two of the few dry years within this period were concurrent with large volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere. This latter result supports the recently described relationship between major volcanic eruptions and the occurrence of isolated drought episodes in the Sahel.\n",

Updraught velocities have been estimated from range height indicator (RHI) Doppler velocity measurements using the Chilbolton advanced meteorological radar, as part of the Dynamical and Microphysical Evolution of Convective Storms project (DYMECS). Based on mass continuity and the vertical integration of the observed radial convergence, vertical velocities tend to be underestimated for convective clouds due to the undetected cross-radial convergence. Velocity fields from the UM at a resolution corresponding to the radar observations are used to scale such estimates to mitigate the inherent biases. The analysis of more than 100 observed and simulated storms indicates that the horizontal scale of updraughts in simulations tend to decrease with grid length; the 200-m grid length agreed most closely with the observations. Typical updraught mass fluxes in the 500-m grid length simulations were up to an order of magnitude greater than observed, and greater still in the 1.5-km grid length simulations. The effect of increasing the mixing length in the sub-grid turbulence scheme depends on the grid length. For the 1.5-km simulations, updraughts were weakened though their horizontal scale remained largely unchanged. Progressively more so for the sub-kilometre grid lengths, updraughts were broadened and intensified; horizontal scale was now determined by the mixing length rather than the grid length. In general, simulated updraughts were found to weaken too quickly with height. The findings in terms of updraughts were supported by the analysis of the widths of reflectivity patterns in both the simulations and observations.\n",

In this study, the shortwave TSA is exchanged for a Monte Carlo (MC) photon transport model. More than 44,000 domains of cloud properties retrieved from A-train satellite data, each measuring 256\u2009km in length, were used to assess the noise characteristics of TSA- and MC-based McICA models. It appears as though application of a MC algorithm in McICA will be both beneficial and tractable for LSAMs. This is because known levels of acceptable radiative noise produced by TSA-based McICAs can be achieved with small numbers of MC photons. The greatest concern with the TSA McICA has been noise associated with heating rates for cloudy layers. But with as few as 500\u20131,000 photons per simulation, the MC McICA reduces cloudy layer heating rate errors by typically ~20%. Furthermore, since MC models can utilize detailed descriptions of cloud particle scattering phase functions and TSAs use only corresponding asymmetry parameters, TSA-based McICAs, on average, overestimate all-sky top-of-atmosphere reflected flux density at small solar zenith angles \u03b80 by ~3\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and underestimate it at large \u03b80 by ~1\u2009W\u2009m\u22122; vice versa for surface net flux density.

Under certain conditions these shallow cyclones associated with a cyclonic low-level PV anomaly can serve as precursors for explosive cyclone intensification. The present study is the first to investigate DRWs in the Southern Hemisphere. Two typical DRW case studies are presented and a sophisticated algorithm is used to detect DRWs in operational analysis data from 2001 to 2012. DRWs occur in all ocean basins and seasons with a maximum in summer. On average, about 4 DRWs are found per month and 12% intensify explosively. Thereby, they contribute 6% to the total set of explosively deepening extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. DRW tracks originate slightly closer to the equator compared to normal extratropical cyclones, and they follow the convergence zones eastward and poleward. This results in a climatological DRW track density similar to a spiral, from the western South Pacific and ends in the eastern South Indian Ocean, broken only by the Andes. Eventually, typical synoptic situations associated with DRW genesis are identified. The categories include (i) low-level PV generation by upper-level induced lifting, (ii) a low-level jet-induced diabatic PV generation, and (iii) a transformation of the low-tropospheric PV anomaly from another system.\n",

The WPSH intra-seasonal variability is partly influenced by quasi-stationary wave-trains propagating eastwards from Europe across Asia along the two westerly jets: the Silk-Road wave-train along the Asian jet at mid-latitudes and the polar wave-train along the sub-polar jet. In the unusual summer of 2010, Northeast China experienced its worst seasonal flooding for a decade, triggered by unusually severe precipitation. That summer was also characterized by a record-breaking heat wave over Eastern Europe and Russia, whose impact on the precipitation further east over China has been little explored. Here, we examine the role of the Silk-Road and polar wave-trains, and their impact on precipitation over Northeast China throughout August 2010, using station precipitation data and re-analyses. We found that there is a strong link between the Silk-Road wave-train and extreme precipitation events, associated with a strong occasional influence of the polar wave-train.\nForecasting such regional precipitation events at the monthly timescale remains a big challenge for operational global prediction systems. In this study, we use simulations with the atmospheric model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at a horizontal resolution of T255 to highlight the key role of the intra-seasonal fluctuations of the Silk-Road and polar wave-trains in modulating extreme precipitation over North and Northeast China in August 2010. While the ensemble-mean of the forecasts fails to predict the pulses of the Silk-Road wave-train, some model members show a high spatial correlation in upper-level meridional winds with re-analyses. Similarly, there is high spatial correlation between model meridional winds and precipitation. These results highlight the importance of better representing the intra-seasonal evolution of the Silk-Road wave-train in order to improve the monthly prediction of summer precipitation over the Far East.\n",

These winds are associated with low-level jets, sometimes occurring just above the boundary layer. The question then arises as to how the high momentum is transferred to the surface. An opportunity to address this question arose when the severe \u2018St Jude's Day\u2019 windstorm travelled across southern England on 28 October 2013. We have carried out a mesoanalysis of a network of 1-minute resolution automatic weather stations and high-resolution Doppler radar scans from the sensitive S-band Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar (CAMRa), along with satellite and radar network imagery and NWP products. We show that, although the damaging winds occurred in a relatively dry region of the cyclone, there was evidence within the LLJ of abundant precipitation residues from shallow convective clouds that were evaporating in a localised region of descent. We find that a pocket of high momentum was transported towards the surface by one of a few remaining actively precipitating convective clouds within the LLJ and also by precipitation free convection in the boundary layer that was able to entrain evaporatively cooled air from the LLJ. The boundary layer convection was organised in along-wind rolls separated by 500 m to about 3000 m, the spacing varying according to the vertical extent of the convection. Spacing was greatest where the strongest winds penetrated to the surface. A run with a medium-resolution version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was able to reproduce the properties of the observed LLJ. It confirmed the LLJ to be a sting jet which descended over the leading edge of a weaker cold-conveyor-belt jet.\n",

The equations are then interpreted as a Hamiltonian system, as they are expressed in terms of functional derivatives of the Hamiltonian. Using a finite-difference scheme on a longitude/latitude grid and based either on a Lagrangian or mass-based vertical coordinate, the discrete scheme is obtained by imitating the Hamiltonian formulation at the discrete level. It is shown how this form leads straightforwardly to the conservation of discrete total energy. The relation between the discrete equations and the discrete antisymmetry property of the Poisson bracket is discussed.\nThe computing infrastructure of the dynamical core is kept essentially unchanged but the modification of the hydrostatic balance requires a mass-based vertical coordinate. Also, absolute angular momentum is used as a prognostic variable instead of relative velocity, which allows time-dependent metric terms and the non-traditional Coriolis force to be absorbed into it.\nThe prototype implementation is applied to idealized circulations of an Earth-like small planet and validates the stability and accuracy of the new dynamical core.\n",

The verisimilitude of retrievals will be assessed using data from its broad-band radiometer (BBR), which measures top-of-atmosphere (TOA) short-wave (SW) radiances at three along-track viewing angles. BBR measurements will be compared with their modelled counterparts, simulated by a three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer model acting on retrieved properties, thus defining a radiative closure experiment. Since cloud and aerosol microphysical and hence optical properties within each assessment domain vary horizontally and vertically, one challenge facing the closure process is selection of radiances that will foster the best assessments of retrievals. This study investigates whether co-registration of radiances for closure assessment can be aided by information pertaining to photon paths from the MC model. Unlike methods that provide one effective reflecting layer (ERL), such as cloud-top altitude, simulated photon paths can account for several reflecting layers. For this study, A-Train satellite data provided cloud properties. The MC model was applied to this field to simulate BBR-like measurements. Cloud properties were then perturbed randomly, to represent retrievals in approximate fashion, and the MC model reapplied to them. The resulting sets of radiances mimicked EarthCARE measured and modelled data, thus allowing a test of closure and co-registration methodologies. Through the use of 3D photon path information, the rate of identification of inaccurate cloud retrievals improved over ERL approaches by \u223c4% for cirrus clouds and \u223c15% for broken clouds. For large-scale deep convective clouds, however, inaccurate photon paths, ostensibly due to poor retrievals, reduced identification performance by 3%.\n",

The eigenvalues of the matrix exhibited a step-function-like behaviour: there are 2n + 1 identical (degenerate) eigenvalues for the degree n, the total wave-number-like index. Unlike the spherical harmonic functions, the eigenvectors were found to be not separable into zonal and meridional structure: a part of them reflected the basic geometry of grids, i.e. the cube (icosahedron) for the cubed-sphere (icosahedral) grid. These eigenvectors were shown to consist of only a couple of spherical harmonics. The eigensolutions indicated that the Rossby\u2013Haurwitz waves, the normal modes of absolute-vorticity conserving motion, are affected significantly by the underlying grid system in both horizontal structure (resulting in geodesic Rossby\u2013Haurwitz waves) and phase speed (being larger than theory for the cubed-sphere SEM, but smaller for the icosahedral FDM). It was implied by the eigensolutions that when a prognostic equation incorporates Laplacian-type hyperviscosity, the maximum viscosity coefficient for the cubed-sphere SEM should be given significantly smaller than for the icosahedral FDM, particularly in the case of high resolution with the high-order LLP. Selective filtering or diffusing small-scales was revealed to be practiced more effectively for the cubed-sphere SEM than the icosahedral FDM. The eigenvectors are also discussed in relation to the grid imprinting of the numerical models built on those geodesic grids.\n",

We investigate the possibility of combining an established method based on diagnosing errors from innovation statistics (the so-called Desroziers method) with guidance obtained from adjoint sensitivity tools (which aim to minimise short-range forecast error). In a test version of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 4D-Var assimilation system which uses insitu observations and IASI as the only source of satellite data, it is found that tuning the IASI observation errors with a combined approach is beneficial (compared to using the innovation-based method alone).

During the IOP8, heavy rainfall with intense lightning and consequent devastating flash floods occurred in the WMed region. The synergy of operational networks in the northern WMed, including Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, rain gauges, weather stations, lightning sensors and radiosondes, was used to document in detail the evolution of the heavy precipitation event. In general, the resolution of the aforementioned networks adequately sampled the temporal and spatial variability of the atmospheric water vapour, as well as the position of mesoscale convergence zones which played a key role in the initiation and evolution of convective systems in this case. Nevertheless, high uncertainty was associated with the existence and location of moisture convergence zones and wind convergence lines over the sea, reflecting the need for model analysis and remote-sensing observations to complete the documentation of the event.\n",

        "description": "\nAmong different winter precipitation types, freezing rain is the most dangerous and the most difficult to forecast. Nearly 84% of total freezing rain days in China occur over Guizhou province. Statistical analysis indicates that the frequency distribution of freezing rain over Guizhou is correlated to its topography. In this article, a typical freezing rain case from 2011 is selected to explore the impact of Guizhou topography on the distribution of freezing rain.\nSynoptic analysis shows that this event is dominated by two cold currents below 800 hPa and a warm, moist southwesterly at 700 hPa, which contribute to an overlaying surface cold layer and a warm layer aloft in central Guizhou. Freezing rain is developed through a \u2018warm rain process\u2019 under the mid\u2013lower tropospheric warm layer. Contrasting numerical terrain experiments demonstrate that Guizhou terrain plays an essential role in the formation of freezing rain by influencing the set-up of the surface cold layer, warm layer and precipitation. Except for the effect of altitude, the vertical distance between the cold centre in the cold flow and the surface height also impacts on the formation of the surface cold layer. The intensities of the warm layer and inversion change after altering terrain height. The number of rainwater particles reaching the surface layer decreases as the surface temperature increases in the lowered terrain experiment, whereas the block of steeper windward slope results in an increase of surface precipitation in the heightened terrain experiment. The regions experiencing freezing rain shrink after reducing the terrain but spread southeastwards after raising the terrain. The unique topography of Guizhou including its elevation and distribution contributes to the highest frequency of freezing rain in China.\n",

To test the \u03bb model, an idealized full-physics numerical model is employed to provide wind-profile samples and also to show the influence of environmental temperature and the properties of initial vortices on tropical cyclone size. It is found that the \u03bb model provides an accurate fit of the azimuthal wind profile at the top of the boundary layer. In the simulations, tropical cyclone size is sensitive to sea-surface temperature, upper tropospheric temperature and initial vortex structure. The numerical model confirms the assumed Gaussian distribution with width \u03bb of the moist entropy in the boundary layer. A linear relationship between model cyclone size and \u03bb is found, in agreement with the \u03bb model. The \u03bb model predicts a weak relationship between tropical cyclone size and intensity, as is observed. In addition, the \u03bb model suggests that change in tropical cyclone size should be closely related to angular momentum transport near the boundary layer, as has been found in observations. The good agreement of the \u03bb model with the numerical model shows that the \u03bb model could be a reasonable alternative for characterizing the wind structure of tropical cyclones with only one scaling parameter.\n",

Clustering was estimated by calculating the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of 30 December\u2013February counts of Atlantic storm tracks passing near each grid point. Results from single historical simulations of 1975\u20132005 were compared to those from historical ERA40 reanalyses from 1958 to 2001 and single future model projections of 2069\u20132099 under the RCP4.5 climate change scenario.\nModels were generally able to capture the broad features in reanalyses reported previously: underdispersion/regularity (i.e. variance less than mean) in the western core of the Atlantic storm track surrounded by overdispersion/clustering (i.e. variance greater than mean) to the north and south and over Western Europe. Regression of counts onto North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices revealed that much of the overdispersion in the historical reanalyses and model simulations can be accounted for by NAO variability.\nFuture changes in dispersion were generally found to be small and not consistent across models. The overdispersion statistic, for any 30-year sample, is prone to large amounts of sampling uncertainty which obscures the climate change signal. For example, the projected increase in dispersion for storm counts near London in the CNRMCM5 model is 0.1 compared to a standard deviation of 0.25. Projected changes in the mean and variance of NAO are insufficient to create changes in overdispersion that are discernible above natural sampling variations.\n",

During the NPF events, the formation rate of 5 nm particles ranged from 3.5 to 13.9 cm\u22123 s\u22121and growth rates of both positive and negative ions were greater than those of neutral particles. Total ion concentrations in this size range were approximately double on event days than on non-event days. The NPF events were generally preceded by 2\u20133 h periods of enhanced concentration of ions and aerosols (PECIA) which are associated with katabatic winds from the surrounding hill-slopes at our site. During PECIA, ions \u22648 nm diameter grew faster and attained mode diameters greater than those of neutral particles. PECIA provided the ions of sub-8 nm diameter and dramatically reduced the condensation sinks and thus contributed to the development of conditions conducive for NPF. During PECIA, total concentrations of the ions and particles become almost equal and the Boltzmann charge distribution breaks down. During NPF events, mode diameters of the ions and particles first steeply decreased accompanied by a steep increase in condensation sink but later gradually increased at identical rates.\nObservations of charging ratio of 3\u20134 nm particles being higher than the charge equilibrium value and non-observation of charge equilibrium for >5 nm ions and particles indicate occurrence of ion nucleation and/or advection during the PECIA.\n",

        "description": "\nThe dynamics and large-scale drivers of heat wave (HW) events in Australia are well documented. However, the influence of soil moisture in modulating HWs is largely unexplored. We focus here on a recent significant HW event in southeast Australia that preceded the Black Saturday bushfires (3\u20137 February 2009). During this period, the southeast of Australia experienced unprecedented warm conditions, which, in conjunction with high fuel load and mesoscale weather conditions, led to devastating bushfires. We examine how different initial soil moisture conditions with lead times of 5, 10, and 15 days prior to the event would have altered its overall dynamics at the continental scale. We show that at short lead times (5 days), the influence of perturbing soil moisture is mostly linear. Decreasing (increasing) soil moisture increases (decreases) maximum temperatures, associated with an intensification of the upper-level anticyclone. The effect of increasing soil moisture is more nonlinear than decreasing soil moisture with increasing lead time; namely, increasing soil moisture can also lead to an increase in maximum temperature over some parts of the domain, rather than a decrease everywhere. At lead times of up to 15 days, the imposed perturbation in soil moisture, mostly confined to the Tropics, is essentially lost such that the impact on maximum temperatures on the day of the event cannot be related to the sign of the imposed perturbation in soil moisture. Our results highlight the importance of accurate soil moisture estimates in capturing the intensity and spatial extent of HW events in southeast Australia, but only at relatively short lead times.\n",

The January 2013 tropical (15\u00b0N\u201315\u00b0S) mean value of Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) water vapour satellite data at 82 hPa (2.3 ppmv) was one of the lowest during the instrument record (2004\u20132013). The relationship between a cooling of the tropical tropopause, a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event and convective activity in the western Pacific is investigated using satellite data and reanalysis meteorological products to elucidate the likely origin of those extremely low water vapour concentrations. A major midwinter SSW developed on 6 January 2013. Stratospheric polar temperatures increased by \u223c30 K in a matter of days and temperatures in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) dropped at the same time. As a result of the easterly shear phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the SSW, the tropical tropopause in January 2013 was anomalously cold (zonal mean of 187 K) and elevated (85 hPa). The tropical cold point tropopause (CPT) temperature and water vapour concentration at 82 hPa decreased by about 2 K and 1.5 ppmv respectively within the first 15 days of January; the water vapour change was likely a result of dehydration associated with the rapid cooling of the tropical CPT during that period.\n",

We find that the main dynamical regimes obtained previously in a quasi-geostrophic f-plane model by Matthewman and Esler persist in the global model, with the exception of certain rotating vortex states that depend on the method of initialization.

However, tuning the inflation factor can be costly, thus demanding adaptive covariance inflation (ACI) algorithms that give an online estimate of a temporally varying inflation factor. Additionally, a spatially varying inflation factor should be used to account for an irregular observation network. Anderson's adaptive inflation method offers a spatially and temporally varying inflation factor estimated from innovation statistics using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. In this study, we propose an alternative adaptive covariance relaxation (ACR) method that estimates a relaxation parameter online. Instead of treating inflation parameters as spatially varying random variables as in Anderson's method, the relaxation-to-prior-spread method provides an ensemble spread reduction term that serves as a spatial mask to account for an irregular observation network. We demonstrate with a set of experiments using the 40-variable Lorenz model that the ACR method is able to improve filter performance with the presence of sampling/model errors over a range of severity. Its reliability and ease of implementation suggest potential for future applications with atmospheric models.\n",

Practically all the basic equilibrium stable/neutral and unstable boundary-layer depth prototypes, corresponding limit cases for h, as well as the transition regimes between them, follow from this general formula as respective asymptotic cases. The explicit dependence of the proportionality coefficient for the limit cases on the governing parameters is determined and corresponding comparison with experimental data is given. The case when the Coriolis effect is neglected is separately considered. Again a new general formula for h and the consequent limit cases is obtained in this case. In agreement with the experimental data the great sensitivity of the stable boundary-layer height to the form of the vertical profile of the buoyancy flux is theoretically confirmed and quantitatively analysed. Special attention is paid also to the important role of the free-flow stability effect not only for stable/neutral, but also for unstable conditions.

This article provides a review of existing studies evaluating the impacts of data from the TAO/TRITON array and other components of the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) on current ocean DA systems used for a variety of operational and research applications. It can be considered as background information that can guide the evaluation exercise of TPOS. Temperature data from TAO/TRITON array are assimilated in most ocean DA systems which cover the tropical Pacific in order to constrain the ocean heat content, stratification, and circulation. It is shown that the impacts of observation data depend considerably on the system and application. The presence of model error often makes the results difficult to interpret. Nevertheless there is consensus that the data from TAO/TRITON generally have positive impacts complementary to Argo floats. In the equatorial Pacific, the impacts are generally around the same level or larger than those of Argo. We therefore conclude that, with the current configuration of TPOS, the loss of the TAO/TRITON data is having a significant detrimental impact on many applications based on ocean DA systems. This conclusion needs to be kept under review because the equatorial coverage by Argo is expected to improve in the future.\n",

High-resolution TS-X images resolved the finer bora spatial structure to a scale of \u22481 km, which has not previously been reported in bora research. In particular, the structures in Case 2 appear to be driven by surface convective heat fluxes caused by substantial temperature differences between the relatively high sea surface temperature (SST) and the overflowing very cold air. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations used to aid the analyses suggest that the very low upwind 2m temperature in Case 2 reinforced the orographic wave breaking by enhancing the cross-mountain pressure gradient. The ensuing strong cross-mountain flow was responsible for the appearance of secondary jets in the lee of Mount Velebit, for which the TS-X Case 2 scene provides the first satellite-borne evidence.\n",

Weakly nonlinear theories can be constructed using higher order expansion terms. While these methods undoubtedly have great value for elucidating the relevant physical processes, they are unable to follow the dynamics of a turbulent atmosphere. We provide a first example of the extension of classical stability analysis to a nonlinearly evolving quasi-geostrophic flow. The so-called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) provide a covariant basis describing the directions of exponential expansion and decay of perturbations to the nonlinear trajectory of the flow. We use such a formalism to re-examine the basic barotropic and baroclinic processes of the atmosphere with a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane two-layer model in a periodic channel driven by a forced meridional temperature gradient \u0394T. We explore three settings of \u0394T, representative of relatively weak turbulence, well-developed turbulence and intermediate conditions.\nWe construct the Lorenz energy cycle for each CLV describing the energy exchanges with the background state. A positive baroclinic conversion rate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for instability. Barotropic instability is present only for a few very unstable CLVs for large values of \u0394T. Slowly growing and decaying hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes closely mirror the properties of the background flow. Following the classical necessary conditions for barotropic/baroclinic instability, we find a clear relationship between the properties of the eddy fluxes of a CLV and its instability.

        "description": "Operational high-resolution numerical weather prediction models are now able to partially resolve turbulent motions due to increased computing power. The partitioning of resolved and parametrized fluxes becomes important in the representation of turbulent transfer that determines the state of the atmospheric boundary layer. In this study, successive simulations of a convective boundary layer using the Met Office Large Eddy Model from the large-eddy simulation to the mesoscale limit are compared with the corresponding coarse-grained fields to examine model behaviour over the grey zone. The differences in the turbulent kinetic energy partitioning between coarse-grained (reference) and actual fields are identified and used to quantify sub-grid diffusion in the grey zone under different atmospheric forcings and surface heat flux. It is shown that the excessive mixing due to the large values of mixing length at coarse resolutions results in the cut-off of resolved turbulence in the grey zone. The damping of resolved motions comes earlier for wind shear runs. In contrast, coarse-grained fields exhibit a smooth transition of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy across the scales. Decreasing numerical dissipation through the sub-grid scheme leads to the increase of resolved turbulence, but fails to reproduce the reference transition pattern that imposes some physical limitations to the partially resolved turbulence simulations. Pragmatic blending of mixing length values maintains a more realistic turbulent kinetic energy transition from fine to coarse resolutions and potential temperature profiles in the grey zone. Bounding vertical diffusion to its effective values, an approach based on maintaining inherent properties of the flow across the scales, is able to match the coarse-grained fields from the highly resolved to the almost unresolved state, regardless of the forcing. Finally, the complexity of modelling in the grey zone is exhibited in the dependence of turbulence onset on time and vertical resolution.\n",

The proposed method is based upon combination sets of dual-polarimetric observables (reflectivity at horizontal polarization ZH, differential reflectivity ZDR, specific differential phase KDP, correlation coefficient \u03c1HV) along with temperature data inferred from a numerical weather prediction model output.\nThe performance of the HCA is evaluated using 20 h of multi-frequency dual-polarimetric radar data collected during the first Special Observation Period (SOP1) of the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX). A new method based upon intercomparisons of retrieved hydrometeor data deduced from pairs of neighbouring radars (S-band vs. S-band and S-band vs. C-band) over a common sampling area is proposed to evaluate the consistency of hydrometor classification outputs. S-/C-band radar comparisons generally show better consistency than S-/S-band radar comparisons due to issues with the identification of the 0\u00b0C isotherm on one of the two S-band radars. Imperfect attenuation correction at C-band may also lead into differences in hydrometeor fields retrieved from the C- and S-band radars in convective situations, but retrieved hydrometeor data are globally very consistent from one radar to another. Comparisons against in situ airborne data also confirm the overall good performance of the HCA.\nIn a second experiment, an original method allowing the production of multi-radar three-dimensional (3D) hydrometeor fields from single-radar 2D hydrometeor data is tested on a bow-echo convective system observed with C- and S-band radars. The resulting 3D hydrometeor fields provide a detailed view of the bow-echo microphysical structure and confirm the good performance of both the HCA and interpolation technique.\n",

These \u2018secondary\u2019 cyclones, which grow from frontal waves, are typically small in scale, shallow and deepen rapidly, and pose a challenge to forecasters and numerical weather prediction models. Frontal-wave development has been studied intensively in the past based on observations (e.g. FASTEX), real-case studies or analytical models. In this study, frontal-wave cyclogenesis is studied from a climatological perspective and is detected by a combination of two automated identification methods for the period between 1979 and 2014. A climatology of frontal-wave cyclogenesis is presented. Horizontal composites provide an estimate of the climatological mean of conditions during frontal-wave cyclogenesis which may prove useful in the assessment of the realism of proposed idealized models of frontogenesis. The findings are also compared with assumptions made in earlier idealized studies of frontal waves. The composites reveal coherent structures of diabatically generated low-level PV in the lower troposphere, neutral moist static stability at cyclogenesis and an ambient lower troposphere close to saturation. The vertical PV structure in the east NA is more vertically aligned than in the west NA and PV anomalies from the upper and lower levels reach deeper into the mid-troposphere, which indicates an enhanced phase-lock between the two anomalies. Previous studies suggest the existence of an upper limit of along-frontal stretching above which frontal-wave development is strongly suppressed. The presented multi-decadal analysis confirms its existence in a range between 0.6 and 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121. Finally a climatology of along-frontal stretching for the NA is presented and compared to the fraction of cyclogenesis forming on frontal waves.\n",

The simulations show that the evolution of the baroclinic wave on the \u03b2-plane is more unstable than the corresponding f-plane configuration, experiencing a faster linear growth rate of the most unstable wave mode, a shorter most unstable wavelength, a narrower meridional width, and an earlier breaking of the baroclinic wave. A theoretical analysis based on linearized quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory sheds light on these findings. It is shown that the simulated baroclinic instability waves on both the f- and \u03b2-plane closely match the predicted wavelength, shape and linear growth rate obtained from the QG theory, thus validating the model results.\n",

The forward operator enables direct comparisons of atmospheric simulations with polarimetric radar observations and constitutes a first step towards the assimilation of polarimetric radar data. The parameters of the polarimetric forward operator were defined in order to be consistent (whenever possible) with the model microphysical parametrization. Subjective and quantitative comparisons between observations and simulations are analyzed for S-, C- and X-band radars for two convective cases that were observed in autumn 2012 in southeastern France during the first observing period (SOP1) of the Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) campaign. The good consistency between the medians of the observed and simulated distributions of Zdr and Kdp as a function of Zhh, in rain and in dry snow, enables the validation of the parametrization of the polarimetric forward operator. However, the higher spread in observed Zdr and Kdp\n(due to noise and microphysical variability) reveals a need for careful data quality control and pre-processing for use in assimilation. Comparisons between observed and simulated vertical profiles of Zhh, Kdp and Zdr in convective areas also show generally good agreement. Some differences between observations and simulations are attributed to model limitations, in particular its one-moment microphysics scheme and coarser resolution.\n",

The main objectives of this study are to understand the impact of near-surface wind observations on the analysis and to point out aspects that need to be improved to make a better use of these observations. A geo-statistical observation operator has been developed to correct for systematic and representativeness errors. Assimilation experiments were performed in a simplified context, assimilating only near-surface wind observations over land in the ensemble-variational data assimilation system developed at Environment Canada. Due to the background-error covariances, the assimilation of near-surface wind observations impacts the lower part of the atmosphere. The resulting correction has been evaluated by verifying the analyses against non-assimilated collocated radiosonde data. This assessment also made it possible to estimate the observation error variance to strike a balance between having an important impact at the surface and maintaining a good vertical fit to upper air observations. Results from 1 month of assimilation experiments show that the geo-statistical operator eliminates biases and significantly reduces representativeness errors as well as observation error correlations in the analysis, mainly over complex terrain. Results also show that flow-dependent background error covariances from ensembles provide better vertical information propagation than static error statistics. Overall, the analysis fit to non-assimilated collocated radiosonde observations is improved when assimilating wind observations from surface stations.\n",

Around the Indonesian maritime continent, the Aquarius data assimilation leads to salinity distributions which are closer to buoy observations, while in the region of the Amazon River plume, subsurface temperatures are improved following a better reproduction of the low-salinity plume in the surface layer. The SSS model biases are also reduced in the eastern equatorial Pacific and in the Arctic Ocean, although our data are limited in number and accuracy at high latitudes.

The updraught velocities increase with warming, with the largest fractional increases occurring in the upper troposphere and for the highest percentile updraughts. A plume model approximately reproduces the increases in updraught velocities if the plume environment is prescribed as the mean profile in each simulation while holding the entrainment and microphysical assumptions fixed. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) also increases with warming in the simulations but at a much faster fractional rate when compared with the square of the updraught velocities. This discrepancy is investigated with a two-plume model in which a weakly entraining plume represents the most intense updraughts, and the environment is assumed to adjust so that a more strongly entraining plume has negligible buoyancy. The two-plume model suggests that updraught velocities increase with warming at a lower fractional rate than implied by the CAPE because of the influence of entrainment on both the mean stratification and the updraughts themselves.\n",

The aircraft campaign STABLE aimed to improve our current understanding of the formation of convective plumes over leads and their impact on the polar atmospheric boundary layer. It was carried out over the pack ice in the northern Fram Strait in March 2013. We present case studies of the boundary layer modification and turbulent fluxes over four wide leads, which differed strongly with respect to lead characteristics and environmental conditions. The observed near-surface sensible heat fluxes ranged from 15 to 180 W m\u22122. The leads also induced an increase of the near-surface temperature of up to 3.2 \u00b0C and a humidity increase of up to 0.2 g kg\u22121. In one of the cases, large entrainment fluxes exceeding 30% of the surface fluxes were observed. Vertical profiles of turbulent sensible heat and momentum fluxes were nonlinear downstream of the leads with a distinct flux maximum in the core of the convective plumes. In two cases, the plumes also strongly affected the wind field within the atmospheric boundary layer. Low-level jets that existed in those cases in the region upstream of the leads disappeared in the plume region. Finally, it is shown that large errors can occur when flux measurements are derived from lead orthogonal flight legs only. Therefore, complex flight patterns, as presented in this study, are necessary to accurately determine the energy fluxes in the environment of leads.\n",

This approach allows rapid adjustment of forecast fields, or functions of those fields, \u2018offline\u2019, without the expense or time of running the full dynamical model. Furthermore, by updating an ensemble, forecast uncertainty is also adjusted.

Results show that the method is effective at reducing forecast errors in surface pressure at least 18\u201324 h after the observation time, with a maximum impact of 9\u201315% for 12 h forecasts. Results for surface temperature show an error reduction 6\u201312 h after the observation time.

Long-duration (1 month) austral winter forecasts with a horizontal grid spacing of 1.5 km are used to quantify the mountain-wave momentum fluxes generated by the island and the low-level drag associated with flow-blocking dynamics. The characteristics of the drag, such as the occurrence of high and low drag states, its dependence on wind direction and the spectral contributions to the mountain-wave momentum flux, are considered. Flow splitting and low-level wave breaking are shown to be responsible for wake regions that extend for hundreds of kilometres from the island. Regions of deceleration are also evident in the stratosphere, due to mountain-wave dissipation. The extent to which an orographic drag parametrization scheme can reproduce the drag is investigated by comparison with coarse-resolution (15 km grid spacing) simulations in which the orography is poorly resolved and a large proportion of the drag is parametrized. It is demonstrated that the total of the resolved plus parametrized drag in these simulations closely resembles that at high resolution, although it is underpredicted during instances of high drag. Simple modifications to the scheme, which enhance the drag when the low-level flow is approximately normal to the major axis of the subgrid orography, are shown to rectify this. The study demonstrates that, at least for relatively simple isolated mountain ranges, the drag and mountain-wave momentum fluxes can be predicted in a deterministic sense by a well-tuned parametrization scheme of suitable complexity, although inclusion of stochastic effects might lead to yet further improvements.\n",

The data are applied to quantify prediction skill out to Day-14 for maximum and minimum temperature, and for precipitation amount and probability. An innovative statistical analysis is applied to the data. This analysis clearly demonstrates the need for long time series of forecasts in order to reliably assess long-term trends. The accuracy of the current official Day 5\u20137 forecasts is found to be similar to that of Day-1 forecasts from 50 years ago. The accuracy of experimental Day 8\u201310 forecasts is comparable to that of the Day 5\u20137 forecasts, when they were first officially provided 15 years ago. Some overall skill, albeit limited, is evident out to Day-14 and significance testing indicates that it is unlikely that this apparent skill arose by chance. The results provide evidence of deterministic weather forecast skill out to the hypothesised 15 day limit on such predictions. However, in so doing, the results raise the possibility that the limit may be breached at some stage in the future.\n",

The SST conditions and performance of the south Asian monsoon during 2013 boreal summer months (June\u2013September) led us to hypothesize that the strong extratropical SST anomalies in the North Pacific and North Atlantic in conjunction with weak tropical SST anomalies (weak La Ni\u00f1a) were responsible for the above-normal rainfall over India during 2013. We also argue that the 2013 SST pattern and above-normal monsoon condition are not unique but occurred on several occasions in the past. Further, we show that there is a complementary pattern of strong extratropical SST and weak tropical SST that is associated with below-normal south Asian monsoon rainfall. We also show that the extratropical SST pattern in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with a low-frequency interdecadal mode of variability indicating potential predictability associated with such extratropical SST forcing. Extensive experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced by such SST conditions elucidate the mechanism through which the extratropical SSTs influence the Indian monsoon. The SST anomalies affect the north\u2013south temperature gradient and lead to a local displacement of the jet stream, setting up a quasi-stationary wave. Such a stationary wave, in turn, affects the tropospheric temperature (TT) over southern Eurasia, influencing the north\u2013south TT gradient in the region and thereby the Indian monsoon. Our discovery of this additional source of potential predictability together with the fact that the new-generation coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models are capable of predicting the extratropical SST anomalies brightens the prospect of south Asian monsoon prediction.\n",

        "description": "\nHistorically, the objective identification of atmospheric wave-packets has been very elusive. However, interest in these important sources of atmospheric variability has recently increased, and some automated tracking methods have been proposed. The Rossby wave packet (RWP) tracking algorithms opened the way to different types of investigation, ranging from climatology and predictability to assessing the impact of climate change on wave packet characteristics. The present study investigates the relationship between predictability (intrinsic and practical, i.e. predictive skill in a numerical weather prediction model) and the properties of RWPs, such as temporal duration, spatial extension and their area of genesis. Results suggest a significant correlation between RWP length and medium-range skill over Europe and the Northern Hemisphere. Analysis of an ensemble system shows that the spread decreases when long-living RWPs are present in the forecast, supporting the hypothesis that part of the observed increase in skill could indeed be attributed to higher intrinsic predictability induced by RWPs. Higher than average medium-range forecast skill scores are often associated with the presence of long-lasting RWPs (duration of at least 8 days) in the initial conditions, with a source often located in the west Pacific. On the contrary, bad medium-range forecast skill scores tend to be associated with shorter RWPs coming from the central USA or western Atlantic. An analysis of the probabilistic skill scores confirms that predictive skill increases with the presence of long RWPs from the west Pacific, up to week 3.\n",

        "description": "\nA study has been carried out to assess the discrepancies between computed and observed aerosol scattering and backscattering properties in the atmosphere. The goals were: (i) to analyse the uncertainty associated with computed optical properties when spherical and spheroidal approximations are used, and (ii) to estimate nephelometry errors due to angular truncation and non-Lambertian illumination of the light source in terms of size range, particle shape and aerosol chemical compounds. Mie and T-matrix theories were used for computing light optical properties for spherical and spheroidal particles, respectively, from observed particle size distributions. The scattering coefficient of the fine mode was not much influenced by the particle shape. However, computed backscattering values underestimated the observed values by \u223c15%. For the coarse mode, the spheroidal approximation yielded better results than that for spherical particles, especially for backscattering properties. Even after applying the spheroidal approximation, computed scattering and backscattering values within the coarse mode underestimated the observed values by \u223c49% and \u223c11%, respectively. The angular correction most widely used to correct the nephelometer data was discussed to explore its uncertainty. In the case of the scattering properties within the coarse mode, the change of the computed optical parameter is \u223c+8% and for the scattering and backscattering values within the fine mode it is lower than \u223c\u00b14% for spherical and spheroidal particles. Additionally, if the spheroidal particles are used to evaluate the aerosol optical properties, the correction must be reconsidered with the aim of reducing the uncertainty found for scattering within the coarse mode. This is recommended for sites with desert dust influence; then the deviation of the computed scattering can be up to 13%.\n",

This article presents the verification of ice forecast skill from a new system implemented recently at the Canadian Meteorological Centre called the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS). GIOPS provides daily global ice and ocean analyses and 10-day forecasts on a 1/4\u00b0-resolution grid. GIOPS includes a multivariate ocean data assimilation system that combines satellite observations of sea-level anomaly and sea-surface temperature (SST) together with in situ observations of temperature and salinity. Ice analyses are produced using a 3D-Var method that assimilates satellite observations from SSM/I and SSMIS together with manual analyses from the Canadian Ice Service. Analyses of total ice concentration are projected onto the thickness categories used in the ice model using spatially and temporally varying weighting functions derived from ice model tendencies. This method may reduce deleterious impacts on the ice thickness distribution when assimilating ice concentration, as it can directly modulate (and reverse) nonlinear processes such as ice deformation. An objective verification of sea ice forecasts is made using two methods: analysis-based error assessment focusing on the marginal ice zone, and a contingency table approach to evaluate ice extent as compared to an independent analysis. Together the methods demonstrate a consistent picture of skilful medium-range forecasts in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as compared to persistence. Using the contingency table approach, GIOPS forecasts show a significant open-water bias during spring and summer. However, this bias depends on the choice of threshold used. Ice forecast skill is found to be highly sensitive to the assimilation of SST near the ice edge. Improved observational coverage in these areas (including salinity) would be extremely valuable for further improvement in ice forecast skill.\n",

        "description": "\nLiquid layer clouds are abundant globally. Lacking strong convection, they do not become electrified by the usual thunderstorm mechanisms of collisional electrification between hydrometeors of different phases. Instead, the background global circuit current flow in fair weather is largely unaffected by the layer cloud's presence, and, if the layer cloud is extensive horizontally, the vertical fair weather conduction current passes through the cloud. A consequence of the vertical current flow is that, at the cloud\u2013air boundary where there is a conductivity transition and droplets form or evaporate, droplet charging occurs. Charge can affect both droplet evaporation and droplet\u2013droplet collisions. Using new radiosonde instrumentation, the charge observed at layer cloud edges is evaluated for both these microphysical droplet processes. This shows that the charging is more likely to affect collision processes than activation, for small droplets. Enhancing the collection efficiency of small droplets modifies their evolution and propagates through the size distribution to shorten the autoconversion time-scale to rain drops, and the cloud radiative properties. Because the conduction current density is influenced by both external (e.g. solar modulation of high-energy particles) and internal (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation) factors, current flow leading to layer cloud edge charging provides a possible route for expressing solar influences on the climate system and a teleconnection mechanism for communicating internal climate variability.\n",

Data were collected during the whole year 2006 in the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) campain. Two seasonal periods are considered: the dry season, when the northeasterly Harmattan is flowing at low tropospheric level, and the wet season, associated with the southwesterly monsoon circulation. The fine vertical structure of temperature, convective air stability and water vapour for each seasonal period is described in detail and differences are emphasized. Typical temporal series and monthly averaged diurnal cycles are presented. It is shown that a diurnal cycle of water vapour is present throughout the year, including the dry season. The diurnal cycle of water vapour is controlled mainly by the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). During the dry season, the diurnal cycle of water vapour is organized into two layers: a lower layer (LL) from the surface up to 0.6\u20131.4 km\u00a0above ground level (agl) and an upper layer (UL) from 1.4 up to 5\u20136 km\u00a0agl. The water vapour distributions in the LL and UL are anticorrelated, with a half-day temporal shift. As a result, the vertically integrated water vapour (IWV), which displays a quasi-sinusoidal diurnal cycle when computed separately for the LL and UL, appears almost flat for the total tropospheric height, due to the half-day period shift. This structure of two layers is not observed during the wet season. Probability density functions (pdfs) of water vapour content are presented. In dry conditions, the pdfs are well fitted by a log-normal distribution, while the Weibull distribution fits the pdfs for wet conditions better.\n",

Using currently available observations from CloudSat and CALIPSO, a technique combining one-dimensional variational (1D-Var) assimilation with four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation has been used to study the impact of cloud-related observations on analyses and subsequent forecasts. Temperature and specific humidity vertical profiles retrieved from 1D-Var using observations of cloud radar reflectivity and lidar backscatter, either separately or in combination, were used as pseudo-observations in the 4D-Var system. Results indicate that 1D-Var analyses get closer to assimilated and also independent observations when appropriate quality control, bias correction and error estimate are applied. The performed 1D+4D-Var assimilation experiments also suggest a slight positive impact of the new observations on the subsequent forecast. Generally, the impact of lidar backscatter from clouds is smaller than that of cloud radar reflectivity.\n",

The resulting method has full second-order accuracy in time, can employ polynomial bases of arbitrarily high degree in space, is unconditionally stable and can effectively adapt the number of degrees of freedom employed in each element at runtime, in order to balance accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, although the proposed method can be implemented on arbitrary unstructured and non-conforming meshes, even its application on simple Cartesian meshes in spherical coordinates can reduce the impact of the coordinate singularity, by reducing the polynomial degree used in the polar elements. Numerical results are presented, obtained on classical benchmarks with two-dimensional models implementing discretizations of the shallow-water equations on the sphere and of the Euler equations on a vertical slice, respectively. The results confirm that the proposed method has a significant potential for NWP applications.\n",

It is shown that this hurricane-scale model contains MPI as an asymptotically stable spiral point under the wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) feedback mechanism. Furthermore, the hurricane development is characterized by two different time-scales instead of a simple linear growth, as often assumed in previous studies. Inclusion of radiative cooling reduces the MPI limit, but the MPI equilibrium in general is structurally stable. In particular, radiative cooling will modify the basin of attraction of the MPI equilibrium and create a domain in the phase space of the hurricane scales such that a vortex would not develop if its initial condition falls within this domain. Potential mechanisms that can further unfold the stability of the MPI equilibrium will also be discussed.\n",

The results have been compared with observational databases, mainly based on satellite measurements. The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been used to consistently compare simulated clouds with satellite data, allowing us to evaluate not only the total cloud cover but also the cloud amount of different cloud types, classified according to their optical thickness and cloud-top pressure. Nine WRF simulations, for the 2002\u20132006 period, were carried out to evaluate the influence on cloud cover of different physical parametrizations and model configurations. In general, model simulations show similar results, underestimating total cloud cover in most of the studied region. In the tropical convective area, high clouds are underestimated, but the net effect on the radiation is partially compensated by the overestimation of cloud optical depth. Major differences appear over subtropical areas dominated by marine boundary-layer clouds, mainly off the coast of Namibia. In this area, simulations show too many thick clouds and too few clouds with lower optical thickness. The net result is an underestimation of low cloud cover. Also, the transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus away from the coast is not realistically modelled.\n",

In the stochastic nonlinear model, solutions reproduce the climatological mean convective activity well and the climatological variance reasonably well for such a simple model.

        "description": "The Smagorinsky subgrid model remains popular in large-eddy simulation (LES) modelling despite its failure to reproduce mean velocity shear within the atmospheric surface layer. Overpredictions as large as 100% are not uncommon, leading to local simulation degradation, and potentially infecting scales further from the surface. Mason and Thomson achieved significant reduction in excessive velocity shear by adding stochastic accelerations on top of the Smagorinsky model to account for backscattered energy from the subgrid scales. However, neither this model nor its later implementation by Weinbrecht and Mason are able to ensure a physically appropriate spatial structure for the backscatter acceleration fields throughout the domain: with the Mason and Thomson model, the backscatter length-scale and anisotropy depend on the local grid spacing and aspect ratio; with the Weinbrecht and Mason model, the backscatter is unavoidably isotropic with uniform length-scale. We propose a new method for the generation of stochastic backscatter acceleration fields which utilises a grid-adaptive filter (GAF) capable of controlling spatial variations in the backscatter length-scale and anisotropy, independently of the model grid. When applied to the atmospheric surface layer, this allows for the backscatter length-scale to be reduced towards surfaces in an appropriate manner, and the backscatter anisotropy to be varied in accordance with the physical anisotropy of the subgrid scales. The GAF model also has wider applicability: it may be used when the LES filter width, and hence the backscatter length-scale, varies spatially with local three-dimensional grid refinement. The GAF model is initially tested for the case of LES of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer, for grid aspect ratios ranging from \u03b1 = \u0394x/\u0394z = 1 \u2212 10, and found to give a reduction in maximum excessive mean velocity shear (from that obtained without backscatter) of around 80%, that is largely independent of \u03b1.\n",

The analysis is limited to the six CMIP-5 models which resolve the stratosphere (high-top models) and which include interactive ozone chemistry. All simulations assumed a conservative 11-year solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variation based on the Naval Research Laboratory model. These model responses are then compared to corresponding observational estimates derived from two independent satellite ozone profile datasets and from ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorological data. The models exhibit a range of 11-year responses with three models (CESM1-WACCM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM and MRI-ESM1) yielding substantial solar-induced ozone changes in the upper stratosphere which compare favourably with available observations. The remaining three models do not, apparently because of differences in the details of their radiation and photolysis rate codes. During winter in both hemispheres, the three models with stronger upper-stratospheric ozone responses produce relatively strong latitudinal gradients of ozone and temperature in the upper stratosphere which are associated with accelerations of the polar night jet under solar maximum conditions. This behaviour is similar to that found in the satellite ozone and ERA-Interim data, except that the latitudinal gradients tend to occur at somewhat higher latitudes in the models. The sharp ozone gradients are dynamical in origin and assist in radiatively enhancing the temperature gradients, leading to a stronger zonal wind response. These results suggest that simulation of a realistic solar-induced variation of upper-stratospheric ozone, temperature and zonal wind in winter is possible for at least some coupled climate models even if a conservative SSI variation is adopted.\n",

They aim to introduce structured wind perturbations randomly into the forecast model, targeting regions of high numerical dissipation, mountain-wave drag and deep convection. Substantially different implementations of the backscatter scheme in different weather centres confirm the weak scientific underpinning of such stochastic parametrizations and the lack of knowledge of where the true model uncertainty lies.\nThe stochastic scheme presented here makes the reasonable assumption that random model error lies primarily with the parametrization of deep convection and, in particular, with its interaction with model dynamics close to the grid scale. This scheme introduces well-defined, circularly symmetric patterns of wind forcing centred on grid columns containing parametrized convective mass transfer. Tests of the scheme in ensemble mode are carried out in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecast model, the spectral basis of which enables a clean implementation in terms of spatially filtered vorticity and divergence forcing fields. Its effectiveness as a model error representation is assessed relative to ECMWF's operational backscatter and perturbed parametrization tendency schemes. Bearing in mind the simplicity of the scheme, it is surprisingly effective in increasing spread, reducing the error of the ensemble mean and increasing probability skill scores, particularly in the Tropics. It is proposed that this representation of backscatter addresses model uncertainty more realistically than current operational stochastic backscatter schemes and may remove the need for a perturbed parametrization tendency approach.\n",

We found that because \u03bbE dominated (>65%) the turbulent flux in the plantation and was at least twice as large as on the grassland (\u03bbE< 35% of the turbulent flux) during heat waves, the ambient temperature over the plantation was up to 5 \u00b0C lower in the afternoon, and averaged 1.2 \u00b0C lower for the whole day, compared with the grassland. Both vegetation covers emitted significant amounts of H when soil water availability was limited and also in winter when canopy cover was mostly inactive because of dormancy in the grassland and mutual shading in the plantation due to low solar angle. During the winter, advection of additional energy from surrounding vegetation suppressed \u03bbE and reduced \u03b1 to <1.0 in both vegetation covers. Advection enhanced \u03bbE during periods of frequent rainfalls in summer, with mean \u03b1 rising to 2.6 in the grassland and 3.4 in the plantation. Consistently low \u03bbE but high H made the grassland a source rather than a sink for advective energy, while the plantation was the opposite. The broadleaved evergreen woody vegetation consistently maintained a larger \u03bbE than the grassland in this mid-latitude environment, contrary to the smaller \u03bbE observed over mostly coniferous forests at high (northern) latitudes (>35\u00b0). Annual evapotranspiration was 54% lower from the grassland (384 mm) than from the plantation (834 mm). Woody vegetation covers dominated by broadleaved species are therefore preferred for buffering extreme high temperatures during heat waves and recommended for rehabilitating degraded landscapes in urban areas. We also present functions for approximating \u03b1 for soil water limited conditions.\n",

While extending the methodology to a variational formulation, experimenting with simple models and making sure consistency was found between the sequential and variational formulations, the limitations of the residual-based approach came clearly to the surface. This note uses the sequential assimilation application to simple nonlinear dynamics to highlight the issue. Only when some of the underlying error statistics are assumed known is it possible to estimate the unknown component. In general, when considerable uncertainties exist in the underlying statistics as a whole, attempts to obtain separate estimates of the various error covariances are bound to lead to misrepresentation of errors. The conclusions are particularly relevant to present-day attempts to estimate observation-error correlations from observation residual statistics. A brief illustration of the issue is also provided by comparing estimates of error correlations derived from a quasi-operational assimilation system and a corresponding Observing System Simulation Experiments framework.\n",

Large-eddy simulations are used to investigate the effect of moist convection on an idealized mesoscale circulation. Sensitivity studies show that moist convection has a significant influence on the characteristics of the mesoscale circulation. We identify three distinct convective phases that influence the mesoscale circulation within the diurnal cycle: firstly, dry convective onset, with a weak circulation and a breeze front that propagates slowly from the cold region into the warmer fluid as a result of the surface discontinuity; secondly, a deep convective phase, where the circulation intensifies and the breeze front propagates faster; and finally a precipitating phase, where strong cold pools develop at the breeze front and accelerate the propagation speed further. Classical density-current theory fails to represent the second phase and is extended using the cloud-base mass flux to account for the observed effects of moist non-precipitating convection on the propagation speed. We demonstrate the applicability of this theory to the results from large-eddy simulations, identify the subtle role of cold pools on density-current propagation and highlight implications for numerical weather prediction.\n",

At the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), initial conditions from an ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) are re-centred on the deterministic high-resolution analysis. This study assesses how the re-centring step affects the ensemble forecasts and what benefits starting directly from the perturbed EDA members may bring. Numerical experiments are based on suitably modified configurations of the ECMWF medium-range ensemble.\nRe-centring leads to an artificial increase of the climatological variance of the initial conditions for variables and spatial scales that are not well constrained in the analysis. For those variables and spatial scales, the EDA variance can reach a similar magnitude as the climatological variance. Re-centring on the unperturbed member of the EDA leads to a degradation of the ensemble skill in comparison to starting directly from the perturbed EDA members. Depending on the amplitude of the EDA spread and which scales are less constrained, different lead times are affected. Furthermore, the re-centring step increases the jumpiness of the ensemble forecasts in general and alters the precipitation frequency during the first 12 h of the forecasts.\nIt also becomes apparent from our results that the benefit for the ECMWF ensemble of starting directly from EDA initial conditions is sensitive to several factors: the difference in analysis accuracy between the unperturbed EDA control and the high-resolution analysis, the number of EDA members, and the EDA spread. At present, the forecast skill still benefits from centring the ensemble initial conditions on the high-resolution analysis, but future changes to the EDA may change the balance.\n",

        "description": "\nThe shallow-water equations in spherical geometry have proven to be an invaluable prototypical tool to advance geophysical fluid dynamics. Many of the fundamental terms and properties, including dynamical consistency, needed to model Earth's atmosphere and oceans are embodied within them. Limitations to their wider use include the following: representation of the Earth as a sphere, rather than as an ellipsoid; gravity not varying latitudinally, but being held constant; the Coriolis force being incompletely represented; and no representation of vertical acceleration.\nRecent work has addressed the first three limitations, but not simultaneously. The present work addresses all four simultaneously by endowing the equations selectively with supplementary terms, whilst respecting dynamical consistency. This is accomplished using Hamilton's principle of least action, but could be done otherwise. It leads to a switch-controlled quartet of shallow-water equation sets, all of which include topography.\nPotential future applications include the following: further sensitivity tests to assess the possible impact of latitudinal variation of gravity; development of improved numerical methods with good conservation properties; examination of the stability of discretizations of the Coriolis terms; and sensitivity tests for the possible impact of vertical acceleration as a function of decreasing horizontal scale. Sensitivity experimentation would, however, necessitate scale analysis of flow regimes to ensure correct interpretation of results.\n",

Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 24 h forecasts for 96 member ensembles provide the basis for analyses of hurricanes Bill (2009), Earl (2010), Igor (2010), Katia (2011) and Ophelia (2011). Ensemble sensitivity analysis is used to investigate which patterns in the analysis have a strong influence on the forecast intensity and then a novel sensitivity compositing technique is used to identify common patterns that affect the forecast intensity. We find a common response for increasing intensity associated with an initial increased primary and secondary circulation, an increased warm core, an elevated tropopause and moistening of the rain-band region. Perturbed initial-condition experiments show a linear response for modest initial amplitude and also signs of nonlinearity for large perturbations, indicating that these sensitivity patterns are robust for limited additional strengthening of the hurricane. When initial perturbations are partitioned into dry and moist variables, we find that most of the forecast change is achieved by the dry dynamics. Further investigation into convective indicators reveals that simulations in which only moist variables are perturbed experience less convective development in the eyewall throughout the forecast.\n",

Previously, several studies have proposed simple statistical models based on a stratospheric predictor to forecast surface climate; however, none of these studies considered a possibility, nor evaluated the skill, of categorical weather forecasts at individual sites. Here we evaluate the skill of the three-category (below-normal, near-normal and above-normal) monthly and two-monthly mean surface air temperature statistical forecasts, both deterministic and probabilistic, which use, as predictors, normalized mean polar cap geopotential height at 150 hPa and mean surface air temperature over the preceding 30-day period (persistence). We show that, during the period 1957\u20132013, at several sites influenced by the Northern Annular Mode variability, the monthly and two-monthly forecasts based on the stratospheric predictor possess a moderate skill in December\u2013March at lead times of several days, but in many cases they only marginally improve forecasts based on persistence only. Nevertheless at some sites in northeastern Europe and northwestern Russia the improvements indicate that statistical climate forecasting at these sites can benefit from addition of stratospheric information. The results of this study further demonstrate usefulness of simple statistical models based on stratospheric predictors, both as a complementary source of forecasts, and as providing benchmarks for evaluating the skill of more complex dynamical systems.\n",

Multiple linear regression is applied to estimate the zonal temperature, wind and annular mode responses to a typical solar cycle, with a focus on both the stratosphere and the stratospheric influence on the surface over the period \u223c1850\u20132005. The analysis is performed on all CMIP-5 models but focuses on the 13 CMIP-5 models that resolve the stratosphere (high-top models) and compares the simulated solar cycle signature with reanalysis data. The 11 year solar cycle component of climate variability is found to be weaker in terms of magnitude and latitudinal gradient around the stratopause in the models than in the reanalysis. The peak in temperature in the lower equatorial stratosphere (\u223c70 hPa) reported in some studies is found in the models to depend on the length of the analysis period, with the last 30 years yielding the strongest response.\nA modification of the Polar Jet Oscillation (PJO) in response to the 11 year solar cycle is not robust across all models, but is more apparent in models with high spectral resolution in the short-wave region. The PJO evolution is slower in these models, leading to a stronger response during February, whereas observations indicate it to be weaker. In early winter, the magnitude of the modelled response is more consistent with observations when only data from 1979\u20132005 are considered. The observed North Pacific high-pressure surface response during the solar maximum is only simulated in some models, for which there are no distinguishing model characteristics. The lagged North Atlantic surface response is reproduced in both high- and low-top models, but is more prevalent in the former. In both cases, the magnitude of the response is generally lower than in observations.\n",

Numerical simulations show that the model-generated dust plume modifies the thermal field, causing a clockwise turning of the vertical shear surrounding the plume, which changes the deep layer steering flow. The change in the steering flow modifies Helene's moving speed and direction as it transits the plume. As Helene exits the plume, it has a different trajectory than it would have had in the absence of dust-radiative forcing. Consequently, the difference in the tracks with and without dust-radiative forcing continues to grow with distance from the plume. The dust-induced changes in temperature and wind together cause Helene's modeled storm track to be in closer agreement with the observed track; the dust-radiative forcing reduces the error in the model's 7-day track forecasts by an average of 27% (\u223c205 km).\n",

Using data from an operational GPS network, radiosondes and microwave radiometers, we studied the spatio-temporal variability of integrated water vapour (IWV) and convection-related parameters in the pre-convective environment over the island. The following spatial differences in the IWV evolution occurred frequently. In the interior of the island the IWV strongly increased around noon, while on the upstream coast only small variations were observed. We showed that a transport of water vapour with thermally driven circulations and the formation of elevated humidity layers due to advective venting caused the diurnal IWV variation over and downstream of the mountains. Spatial inhomogeneities in the pre-convective atmospheric conditions evolved and the knowledge of these turned out to be crucial to understanding the timing and location of isolated deep convection over the island.\n",

The experiments are conducted using two Lorenz 63 (L63) models coupled to mimic the ocean\u2013atmosphere system, and the atmospheric L63 is further coupled to a spatially resolved convective-scale Lorenz 96 (L96). The entire system is treated as the \u2018truth\u2019, and is simulated using a \u2018forecast model\u2019 where L96 is treated as a subgrid-scale process and parametrized using one of three schemes: (i) deterministic, (ii) additive stochastic parametrization, and (iii) perturbed parameter. Perfect initial conditions are applied to investigate uncertainties caused by model errors. The systematic biases are significantly reduced in the perturbed parameter scheme when \u2018informative\u2019 perturbations are applied. An informative perturbation is the difference between the true tendency and the deterministically parametrized tendency. Moreover, the proposed scheme uses a stochastic spectral method, Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), to build a low-cost surrogate model of the perturbed forecast model. The PCE surrogate is an analytic function of the perturbation which effectively produces unbiased forecast statistics at large ensemble size, without the need to integrate the actual perturbed forecast model.\n",

Using integrations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in conjunction with physical arguments, we try to identify what changes are likely to be robust and what the underlying mechanisms might be. We focus on the large-scale zonally averaged circulation, in particular on height of the tropopause, the strength and position of the surface westerlies and the strength and extent of the Hadley Cell. We present analytic arguments and numerical calculations which suggest that under global warming the height of the tropopause will increase in both the transient response and final equilibrium state, and an increase is clearly found in all the comprehensive models in CMIP5. Upper stratospheric cooling is also found in the comprehensive models, and this too can be explained by a radiative argument. Regarding the circulation, most models show a slight expansion and weakening of the Hadley Cell, depending on season and hemisphere. The expansion is small and largely confined to winter but with some expansion in Southern Hemisphere summer. The weakening occurs principally in the Northern Hemisphere but the intermodel scatter is large. There is also a general polewards shift in surface westerlies, but the changes are small and again are little larger than the intermodel variability in the change. This shift is positively correlated with the Hadley Cell expansion to a degree that depends somewhat on the metric chosen for the latter. There is a robust strengthening in the Southern Hemisphere surface winds across seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a slight strengthening in the westerlies in most models in winter but a consistent weakening of the westerlies in summer. We present various physical arguments concerning these circulation changes but none that are both demonstrably correct and that account for the model results. We conclude that the above-mentioned large-scale thermodynamic/radiative changes in the large-scale atmospheric structure are generally robust, in the sense of being both well understood and consistently reproduced by comprehensive models. In that sense the dynamical changes are less robust given the current state of knowledge and simulation, although one cannot conclude that they are, in principle, unknowable or less predictable.\n",

The residuals relationships involving the system-error covariance matrix are similar to those available to derive background, observation and analysis-error covariance information from filter residual statistics. An illustration of the approach is given for two low-dimensional dynamical systems: a linear damped harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear Lorenz system. The application examples consider the important case of evaluating the ability to estimate the model-error covariance from residual time series obtained from suboptimal filters and smoothers that assume the model to be perfect. The examples show the residuals to contain the necessary information to allow for such estimation. The examples also illustrate the consequences of estimating covariances through time series of residuals (available in practice) instead of multiple realizations from Monte Carlo sampling.

It is shown how careful evaluation of innovation statistics provides valuable knowledge about the observation errors and help in the selection of a suitable observation error model. The focus of the article is on the statistical specification of the typical fat tails of the innovation distributions. In observation error specifications, like the one used previously at ECMWF, it is common to assume outliers to represent gross errors that are independent of the atmospheric state. The investigations in this article show that this is not a good assumption for almost all observing systems used in today's data assimilation systems. It is found that a Huber norm distribution is a very suitable distribution to describe most innovation statistics, after discarding systematically erroneous observations. The Huber norm is a robust method, making it safer to include outlier observations in the analysis step. Therefore the background quality control can safely be relaxed. The Huber norm has been implemented in the ECMWF assimilation system for in situ observations. The design, implementation and results from this implementation are described in this article. The general impact of using the Huber norm distribution is positive, compared to the previously used variational quality control method which gave virtually no weight to outliers. Case-studies show how the method improves the use of observations, especially for intense cyclones and other extreme events. It is also discussed how the Huber norm distribution can be used to identify systematic problems with observing systems.\n",

After an extreme weather event occurs, the question is often posed, \u2018Was the event caused by anthropogenic climate change?\u2019 Recently, a new branch of climate science (known as attribution) has sought to quantify how much the risk of extreme events occurring has increased or decreased due to climate change. One method of attribution uses very large ensembles of climate models computed via volunteer distributed computing. A recent advancement is the ability to run both a global climate model and a higher resolution regional climate model on a volunteer's home computer. Such a set-up allows the simulation of weather on a scale that is of most use to studies of the attribution of extreme events. This article introduces a global climate model that has been developed to simulate the climatology of all major land regions with reasonable accuracy. This then provides the boundary conditions to a regional climate model (which uses the same formulation but at higher resolution) to ensure that it can produce realistic climate and weather over any region of choice. The development process is documented and a comparison to previous coupled climate models and atmosphere-only climate models is made. The system (known as weather@home) by which the global model is coupled to a regional climate model and run on volunteers' home computers is then detailed. Finally, a validation of the whole system is performed, with a particular emphasis on how accurately the distributions of daily mean temperature and daily mean precipitation are modelled in a particular application over Europe. This builds confidence in the applicability of the weather@home system for event attribution studies.\n",

Non-stationary time series should therefore be removed from the analysis before assessing turbulence statistics used in similarity functions. Many approaches have been developed over the years to determine non-stationarity of means and (co-)variances, but there has been no systematic investigation of the differences and similarities between the approaches. In this article, we contrast several frequently used approaches, including two statistical tests to determine trends, the determination of a non-stationarity ratio, and the determination of differences in turbulence statistics calculated for different averaging times. We apply these approaches to near-surface time series of wind and temperature collected during the Terrain-induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX). Our results show that the degree of non-stationarity varies considerably with the approach used. Investigation of the time series that are declared stationary by all the above approaches simultaneously reveals that in many cases such time series still show a behaviour indicative of intermittent turbulence, both for stable and unstable conditions. When these approaches are combined with an additional condition for the intermittency level, a rigorous approach for the detection of non-stationarity is developed.\n",

The drag behaviour is determined by partial wave reflection at the shear discontinuity, wave absorption at critical levels (both of which exist in hydrostatic flow) and total wave reflection at levels where the waves become evanescent (an intrinsically non-hydrostatic effect), which produces resonant trapped lee-wave modes. As a result of constructive or destructive wave interference, the drag oscillates with the thickness of the constant-shear layer and the Richardson number within it (Ri), generally decreasing at low Ri and when the flow is strongly non-hydrostatic. Critical-level absorption, which increases with the angle spanned by the wind velocity in the constant-shear layer, shields the surface from reflected waves, keeping the drag closer to its hydrostatic limit. Although, for the parameter range considered here, the drag seldom exceeds this limit, a substantial drag fraction may be produced by trapped lee waves, particularly when the flow is strongly non-hydrostatic, the lower layer is thick and Ri is relatively high. In directionally sheared flows with Ri=O(1), the drag may be misaligned with the surface wind in a direction opposite to the shear, a behaviour that is due totally to non-trapped waves. The trapped lee-wave drag, the reaction force of which is felt on the atmosphere at low levels, may therefore have a distinctly different direction from the drag associated with vertically propagating waves, which acts on the atmosphere at higher levels.\n",

The same compositing procedure is applied to simulated and observed MJOs, which uses a coordinate system that moves with the precipitation centre, and treats developing, mature and dissipating stages separately. MJO structure and evolution are similar in the simulation and the observations. To the west of the developing convection, there is a broad region of low-level (upper-level) perturbation westerlies (easterlies), which is accompanied by a deep negative temperature perturbation. As this feature enters the MJO-formation region, convection intensifies on its eastern edge, and the zonal wind perturbations decrease in zonal extent and propagation speed. This process is shown to be a dynamical consequence of a largely dry, first baroclinic Kelvin wave entering a region where large-scale upward motion is mostly balanced by convective heating. As the MJO matures, a Kelvin wave of opposite sign emerges from its eastern edge, and makes the opposite transition (from moist to dry). The resulting wave, which includes low-level (upper-level) easterlies (westerlies) and a deep positive temperature perturbation, rapidly propagates around the world and dissipates MJO convection. The Kelvin wave that initiates MJO convection is shown to originate from the inactive phase of a previous MJO, so that the complete MJO cycle is characterized by the two kinds of Kelvin waves emerging from active and suppressed phases of MJO convection, circumnavigating the Tropics, and triggering the opposite phase.\n",

The purpose of this article is to raise awareness of the formal solutions, so that approximations can be placed in a proper context. The representation errors appear in the likelihood, and the different possibilities for the representation of reality in model and observations are discussed, including nonlinear representation probability density functions. Specifically, the assumptions needed in the usual procedure to add a representation error covariance to the error covariance of the observations are discussed, and it is shown that, when several sub-grid observations are present, their mean still has a representation error; so-called \u2018superobbing\u2019 does not resolve the issue. Connection is made to the off-line or on-line retrieval problem, providing a new simple proof of the equivalence of assimilating linear retrievals and original observations. Furthermore, it is shown how nonlinear retrievals can be assimilated without loss of information. Finally we discuss how errors in the observation operator model can be treated consistently in the Bayesian framework, connecting to previous work in this area.\n",

It is found that the stability criteria for non-parallel basic flow under small-amplitude disturbances are more complicated than those for parallel basic flow, and the spatial structure of basic flow at a horizontal boundary has a great impact on the stability of both parallel and non-parallel basic flow. Results obtained in this work extend the stability results of Eliassen which are valid for parallel basic flow with non-normal geostrophic flow as lateral boundary conditions. It is shown that, although there is a strong similarity between the SG model in ICs and the shallow-water SG (SWSG) model, the finite-amplitude stability theorems for the latter model cannot be extended to the SG model in ICs and the reasons for the failure are discussed.\n",

After identifying strong and extreme DAEs, at a 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0\ngeographical-cell level, 255 dust aerosol episode days (DAEDs) and 148 cases of consecutive DAEDs, namely desert aerosol episode cases (DAECs), are defined. For each DAEC, the evolution of the lower tropospheric circulation 1 and 2 days before, during the initiation and after the cessation of the DAEC, is considered. S-mode factor analysis and k-means cluster analysis are applied on mean sea-level pressure and 700 hPa geopotential height fields obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis Project, classifying the 148 cases of atmospheric-circulation evolution into six homogeneous and discrete clusters. The mean intra-annual variation of the DAECs reveals a primary maximum in May (18.9%), and their mean annual number is equal to 11.4 DAECs. On a seasonal basis, the highest percentage of the DAECs is found in spring (51.4%). Maximum duration of the DAECs is 7 days, with 58.8% lasting 1 day. Annually, the mean monthly number of the DAEs varies from 35.8 (September) to 58.0 (April). The western parts of the Mediterranean are affected by the DAEs when cyclonic conditions prevail in the western Mediterranean and northwestern Africa. In contrast, the central and eastern parts of the study region are affected by dust storms when a low-pressure system in the central Mediterranean or central Europe and an anticyclone in the eastern Mediterranean prevail. As to the mean regional intensity (aerosol optical depth at 550 nm) the strong DAEs vary from 0.67 to 0.77, while the extremes vary from 1.14 to 2.06. Generally, strong DAEs are more frequent than extremes (in five out of six clusters).\n",

Earth's geopotential surfaces are traditionally represented as spheres. However, the suitability of this spherical representation for state-of-the-science models is debatable: the geopotentials are more accurately approximated by ellipsoids. A new, ellipsoidal, geopotential approximation is proposed. It is not based on confocal or similar ellipses (as used in previous studies) but is nevertheless relatively simple and analytically tractable. It properly represents the underlying physics, and gives geophysically realistic horizontal and vertical variation of apparent gravity. Exploiting this geopotential approximation, an orthogonal, ellipsoidal, geopotential coordinate system for atmospheric and oceanic modelling is developed analytically and in a self-consistent manner. By construction, the horizontal coordinate surfaces coincide with geopotential surfaces. This ensures that there is no component of apparent gravity in any direction tangential to coordinate surfaces. Accurate representation of intrinsic horizontal and vertical force balances, such as geostrophic and hydrostatic balance, is thereby facilitated. The proposed coordinate system has the potential not only to improve the quality of terrestrial model forecasts in the future, but to be used to model the atmospheres and oceans of mildly oblate planetary bodies, and also for space weather simulation.\n",

Information is needed for the whole profile. In this study, we analyzed turbulence measurements from a 100 m high meteorological mast at the Danish National Test Station for Large Wind Turbines at H\u00f3vs\u00f3re in Denmark. The site represents flat, homogeneous grassland with an average gust factor of 1.4 at 10 m and 1.2 at 100 m level. In a typical surface-layer gust parametrization, the gust factor is composed of two components, the peak factor and the turbulence intensity, of which the turbulence intensity was found to dominate over the peak factor in determining the effects of stability and height above the surface on the gust factor. The peak factor only explained 15% or less of the vertical decrease of the gust factor, but determined the effect of gust duration on the gust factor. The statistical method to estimate the peak factor did not reproduce the observed vertical decrease in near-neutral and stable conditions and near-constant situation in unstable conditions. Despite this inconsistency, the theoretical method provides estimates for the peak factor when comparing gust durations of 1 and 3 s with averaging period lengths of 10 min and 1 h. A new technique to study the timing of maxima at different levels relative to the maximum gust at some level was developed. Results showed that a 10 m level maximum gust was typically preceded by maxima at higher levels and vice versa: a 100 m gust was usually followed by a maximum at lower levels.\n",

This system is a global ensemble performing forecasts up to 4.5 days. It uses the operational global numerical weather prediction model Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and benefits from variable horizontal resolution, so that it is comparable to some limited-area mesoscale systems over France. Perturbations to the initial conditions are computed by combining an ensemble data assimilation system with singular vectors. Model uncertainties are represented through a \u2018multiphysics\u2019 approach with ten different physical parametrization sets. The article describes the set-up of the system and provides an assessment of the approaches used to represent initial conditions and model uncertainties. The positive impact of the variable horizontal resolution of PEARP is also illustrated. As a global ensemble forecast system (EFS), PEARP is also used to forecast cyclone tracks. It is shown that it has correctly predicted the landfall of hurricane Sandy. The performance of PEARP as run operationally with these features in 2014 is assessed objectively and compared with that of four operational global EFSs using classical probabilistic scores. This comparison is based on The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) data. This is one of the first evaluations of EFSs for short-range forecasts. The reliability and global skill of the five EFSs are evaluated over a three-month period with scores computed against observations. PEARP shows skill comparable to or better than the other EFSs.\n",

The first method is a thermal approach, relying on the gradient of equivalent potential temperature (TH), while the second method is based on temporal changes in the 10 m wind (WND). For a comprehensive objective comparison of the outputs of these methods of frontal identification, both schemes are firstly applied to an idealised strong baroclinic wave simulation in the absence of topography. Then, two case-studies (one in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and one in the Southern Hemisphere (SH)) were conducted to contrast fronts detected by the methods. Finally, we obtain global winter and summer frontal occurrence climatologies (derived from ERA-Interim for 1979\u20132012) and compare the structure of these. TH is able to identify cold and warm fronts in strong baroclinic cases that are in good agreement with manual analyses. WND is particularly suited for the detection of strongly elongated, meridionally oriented moving fronts, but has very limited ability to identify zonally oriented warm fronts. We note that the areas of the main TH frontal activity are shifted equatorwards compared to the WND patterns and are located upstream of regions of main WND front activity. The number of WND fronts in the NH shows more interseasonal variations than TH fronts, decreasing by more than 50% from winter to summer. In the SH there is a weaker seasonal variation of the number of observed WND fronts, however TH front activity reduces from summer (DJF) to winter (JJA). The main motivation is to give an overview of the performance of these methods, such that researchers can choose the appropriate one for their particular interest.\n",

A spectral budget method has been developed to assess the variability of \u03c3u/u\u2217 under unstable atmospheric stratification. At least three different length-scales\u2014the distance from the ground (z), the height of the atmospheric boundary layer (\u03b4) and the Obukhov length (L)\u2013are all found to be controlling parameters in the variation of \u03c3u/u\u2217. Analytical models have been developed and supported by experiments for two limiting conditions: z/\u03b4 < 0.02, \u2212z/L < 0.5 and 0.02 \u226a z/\u03b4 < 0.1, \u2212z/L > 0.5. Under the first constraint, the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum is predicted to follow three regimes: k0, k\u22121 and k\u22125/3, divided in the last two regimes by a break-point at kz = 1, where k denotes the wave number. The quantity \u03c3u/u\u2217 is shown to follow the much discussed logarithmic scaling, reconciled to Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis \u03c3u2/u\u22172=B1\u2212A1log(z/\u03b4), where the coefficients B1 and A1 are modified by MOST for mildly unstable stratification. Under the second constraint, the turbulent energy spectrum tends to become quasi-inertial, displaying k0 and k\u22125/3 with a break-point predicted to occur at 0.3 < kz < 1. The work here brings together well-established but seemingly unrelated theories of turbulence such as Kolmogorov's hypothesis, Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis, MOST and Heisenberg's eddy viscosity under a common framework.\n",

Extending the work of Dubos and Kevlahan, a wavelet multiscale approximation is used to make the Thuburn-Ringler-Skamarock-Klemp (TRiSK) model dynamically adaptive for the rotating shallow-water equations on the sphere. This article focuses on the challenges encountered when extending the adaptive wavelet method to the sphere and ensuring an efficient parallel implementation using message passing interface (MPI). The wavelet method is implemented in Fortran 95 with an emphasis on computational efficiency and scales well up to O(102) processors for load-unbalanced scenarios and up to at least O(103) processors for load-balanced scenarios. The method is verified using standard smooth test cases and a nonlinear test case proposed by Galewsky et al. The dynamical grid adaption provides compression ratios of up to 50 times in a challenging homogenous turbulence test case. The adaptive code is about three times slower per active grid point than the equivalent non-adaptive TRiSK code and about four times slower per active grid point than an equivalent spectral code. This computationally efficient adaptive dynamical core could serve as the foundation on which to build a complete climate or weather model.\n",

Both conforming and non-conforming grids are adopted including static and dynamically adaptive grids for a total of twelve mesh configurations. The behaviour of CG and DG on the different grids are compared for a nonlinear midlatitude perturbed jet and for a linear case that admits an analytic solution. Because the inviscid solution on certain grids shows a high sensitivity to the resolution, the viscous counterpart of the governing equations is also solved and the results compared. The logically unstructured element-based CG/DG model described in this article is flexible with respect to arbitrary grids. However, we were unable to define a best grid configuration that could possibly minimize the error regardless of the characteristic geometry of the flow. This is especially true if the governing equations are not regularized by the addition of a sufficiently large, fully artificial, diffusion mechanism, as will be shown. The main novelty of this study lies in the unified implementation of two element-based Galerkin methods that share the same numerical machinery and do not rely on any specific grid configuration to solve the shallow-water equation on the sphere.\n",

Over the Sahara, the world's largest source of mineral dust, this phenomenon is of particular importance to the emission and transport of desert aerosol. We present the first ever detailed large-eddy simulations of dust-generating LLJs. Using sensitivity studies with the UK Met Office large-eddy model (LEM), two key controls of the nocturnal LLJ are investigated: surface roughness and the Coriolis force. Functional relationships derived from the LEM results help to identify optimal latitude\u2013roughness configurations for a maximum LLJ enhancement. Ideal conditions are found in regions between 20 and 27\u00b0N with roughness lengths >0.0001 m providing long oscillation periods and large jet amplitudes. Typical LLJ enhancements reach up to 3.5 m s\u22121 for geostrophic winds of 10 m s\u22121. The findings are largely consistent with results from a theoretical LLJ model applied for comparison. The results demonstrate the importance of latitude and roughness in creating regional patterns of LLJ influence. Combining the functional relationships with high-resolution roughness data over northern Africa gives good agreement with the location of morning dust uplift in satellite observations. It is shown that shear-induced mixing plays an important role for the LLJ evolution and surface gustiness. With decreasing latitude the LLJ oscillation period is longer and, thus, shear-induced mixing is weaker, allowing a more stable nocturnal stratification to develop. This causes a later and more abrupt LLJ breakdown in the morning with stronger gusts, which can compensate for the slower LLJ evolution that leads to a weaker jet maximum. The findings presented here can serve as the first step towards a parametrization to improve the representation of the effects of nocturnal LLJs on dust emission in coarser-resolution models.\n",

        "description": "\nTropical precipitation is caused by many processes that occur over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Such processes vary from local, diurnal convection driven by a destabilisation of the boundary layer to planetary-scale systems that result in rainfall over many days. It is therefore important to assess whether general circulation models (GCMs) can represent these processes given that such models are routinely used to project future rainfall in the low latitudes. In this study, we evaluate the rainfall and circulation characteristics of ten GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) over northern Australia. This work shows that the diurnal cycle of the low-level (925 hPa) flow around the heat low is represented well by the models but the timing of precipitation is not (triggered too early). There is also evidence that mid-level synoptic systems that are responsible for initiating rain in the observations are also present in all of the models. Nevertheless, the biases in the modelled seasonal mean precipitation seem to be linked to the strength of both the meridional flow into northern Australia and the vertical mass flux. Furthermore, there is also evidence that the representation of convection in these models is likely contributing to both the precipitation and circulation errors over northern Australia.\n",

The combination of the MT's low-inclined orbit with the SAPHIR's six channels was found to increase the number of assimilated humidity-sensitive microwave observations in the Tropics by a factor of 3.8, compared with a control experiment using three existing Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B and Microwave Humidity Sounder instruments. Impacts of SAPHIR on both analyses through the 4D-Var system and forecasts are found to be positive with respect to radiosonde data and analyses by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts up to 12 h and neutral to positive up to 72 h. In particular, the improvement of innovation statistics for other humidity-sensitive satellite observations when SAPHIR is assimilated indicates a positive synergy of the MT satellite with the present observing system. In addition to providing new humidity observations in the Tropics, the SAPHIR data can also be used to define new diagnostics for NWP models. In particular: (i) with the MT's orbit being non-heliosynchronous, all local times are observed by the same sensor for a given area, which makes diurnal cycle diagnostics straightforward to set up; (ii) with SAPHIR providing more information on the vertical (six channels) than similar sensors, it can be easily used to study water-vapour vertical structures in NWP models. The first diagnostic applied to the ARPEGE model reveals a good consistency between observed and modelled diurnal cycles in analyses over western Africa, but also reveals a 2\u20134 h time lag between mean observed and equivalent model brightness temperatures. The second diagnostic highlights a well-represented vertical correlation of simulated brightness temperatures from the ARPEGE model with respect to SAPHIR over western Africa, but a too-low vertical correlation over drier regions such as the southern Pacific Ocean during the period June to August 2012.\n",

An idealized valley\u2013plain topography and a spatially constant but time-dependent surface sensible heat flux are used to generate upslope, upvalley and plain-to-mountain winds. A systematic variation of valley depth, width and length induces differences in the cross- and along-valley flow field and thermal structure of the boundary layer. The deeper the valley, the stronger the upvalley winds and the more favoured the formation of vertically stacked circulation cells and an elevated valley inversion layer. Upvalley winds become weaker for wide valleys. The development of plain-to-mountain circulations increases vertical exchange processes between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere considerably, compared with vertical transport processes over a plain. The analysis of mass-flux budgets and forward trajectories indicates that mass is transported three to four times more effectively from the surface to the free atmosphere over valleys than over flat terrain.

Tested parameters include physical packages of cumulus (Cu), planetary boundary-layer (PBL), microphysics (MP) and radiative (RAD) schemes. The simulations are compared with satellite-based observations, ship-based radiosonde data and state-of-the-art atmospheric model reanalyses. Results show that cumulus, microphysics and radiative parametrizations exert a large influence on the simulated seasonal distribution of regional convective rainfall. Non-local PBL schemes are determinant to simulate the correct surface wind pattern and water vapor distribution in order to get realistic precipitation from intra-seasonal to diurnal scales, especially over the ocean where the nocturnal rainfall representation is improved.\n",

        "description": "\nCurrent understanding of the behaviour of sea breezes in the offshore environment is limited but rapidly requires improvement due, not least, to the expansion of the offshore wind energy industry. Here we report on contrasting characteristics of three sea-breeze types on five coastlines around the southern North Sea from an 11 year model-simulated climatology. We present and test an identification method which distinguishes sea-breeze types which can, in principle, be adapted for other coastlines around the world. The coherence of the composite results for each type demonstrates that the method is very effective in resolving and distinguishing characteristics and features. Some features, such as jets and calm zones, are shown to influence offshore wind farm development areas, including the sites of the proposed wind farms up to 200 km offshore. A large variability in sea-breeze frequency between neighbouring coastlines of up to a factor of 3 is revealed. Additionally, there is a strong association between sea-breeze type on one coastline and that which may form coincidentally on another nearby. This association can be as high as 86% between, for example, the North Norfolk and East Norfolk coasts. We show, through associations between sea-breeze events on coastlines with contrasting orientations, that each coastline can be important for influencing the wind climate of another. Furthermore, we highlight that each sea-breeze type needs separate consideration in wind power resource assessment and that future larger turbines will be more sensitive to sea-breeze impacts.\n",

It is first shown that a stable balanced vortex of finite extent can be embedded in an ambient fluid at rest, and that such a vortex exists for prescribed angular momentum and potential temperature on fluid parcels. This uses a method developed by Shutts, Booth and Norbury. This is a different way of viewing the problem from the normal methods, which analyse the stability of a prescribed vortex. The stability of the vortex depends on the presence of background rotation and on the azimuthal velocity at the boundary of the vortex being less than that in the surrounding ambient fluid. It is then shown that the evolution of this vortex under axisymmetric forcing can be written as a conservation law for a potential pseudo-density in the transformed coordinates introduced by Schubert and Hack. The stability of the vortex to non-axisymmetric perturbations is also discussed.\n",

Based on dimensional analysis (Pi theorem), it is shown that any properly scaled statistics of the small-scale turbulence are universal functions of a stability parameter defined as the ratio of a reference height z and the Dougherty\u2013Ozmidov length scale, which in the limit of z-less stratification is linearly proportional to the Obukhov length scale. Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at five levels on a 20 m tower over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to examine the behaviour of different similarity functions in the stable boundary layer. In the framework of this approach the non-dimensional turbulent viscosity is equal to the gradient Richardson number, whereas the non-dimensional turbulent thermal diffusivity is equal to the flux Richardson number. These results are a consequence of the approximate local balance between production of turbulence by shear in the mean flow and viscous dissipation. The turbulence framework based on the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy may have practical advantages for estimating turbulence when the fluxes are not directly available.\n",

In this extreme high-temperature (EHT) event, surface air temperatures above 37.0 \u00b0C were recorded in and around Kumagaya, an area just north of the convergence line between westerly winds from the Chubu Mountains and a southwesterly wind from the Pacific Ocean. To determine the mechanism of this EHT event, we applied various analyses using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and observational data. According to the heat budget analysis obtained from the WRF model, during the morning most of the sensible heat supply to the mixed layer came from the net heat input, due to surface sensible heat transported by subgrid-scale turbulent diffusion. However, most of the net heat input came from advective heat transport after noon, when the westerly wind penetrated the EHT area. This westerly wind, according to backward trajectory, Lagrangian energy budget and Eulerian forward tracer analyses, arose from a combination of two kinds of foehn flow (\u2018hybrid\u2019-type foehn wind). Specifically, the westerly wind became a foehn wind that was caused by dry-adiabatic heating and wet-diabatic heating with water vapour condensation. This \u2018hybrid\u2019 foehn wind was an important factor in causing the present EHT event.\n",

        "description": "\nActive satellite sensors, such as Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and CloudSat, provide cloud properties that are not available from passive sensors, such as MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While active sensors provide vertical profiles of clouds, their spatial coverage is limited to their narrow, nadir ground-track. As a result, estimation of radiation by combining active sensors and broadband instrument has limitations due to their different spatial coverages. This study uses a scene construction algorithm (SCA) and MODIS data to extend two-dimensional (2D) nadir cloud profiles into the cross-track direction, and examines how the resulting constructed 3D cloud fields improve simulation of solar radiative transfer. Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiances are used as references to assess the improvements.\nWhile use of constructed 3D cloud fields only slightly impacts mean-bias errors for instantaneous 20 km CERES footprint-averaged top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances, reductions in random errors are about 40%. The largest improvements in TOA radiance simulation are for clouds with small-scale horizontal inhomogeneity such as stratocumulus and cumulus. In contrast, uniform clouds such as nimbostratus, and deep convective clouds (Dc) show little response to the SCA. The impact of using the SCA on instantaneous surface irradiances is significant for stratocumulus and cumulus, but weak for nimbostratus and Dc. Conversely, SCA significantly influences atmospheric absorption and heating rates for nimbostratus and Dc.\nDifferences in TOA radiances simulated by 1D and 3D transfer models are smaller than differences due to use of only the 2D nadir cross-sections and the 3D constructed fields. This is because of smoothing of 3D radiative effects when averaged up to CERES footprints. For surface irradiance and atmospheric absorption, however, differences simulated by 1D and 3D transfer models are more comparable to differences that stem from use of 2D and 3D cloud information.\n",

        "description": "\nLinear instability of warm-core eddies of constant potential vorticity (PV) is studied in a two layer, finite depth, shallow-water ocean. The basic state flow in the constant PV eddy that obeys the gradient balance cannot be described by explicit expressions and can be solved only numerically. The various cases of gradient balance are classified by constructing a canonical formulation that relates any PV value to a value of the angular velocity that has to prevail near the centre of the constant PV eddy. The growth rates of perturbations imposed on the basic state are calculated for a variety of values of the (constant) PV and the depth of the surrounding ocean. The growth-rates, i.e. the eigenvalues, are calculated numerically by using a shooting to fitting point method which guarantees that the corresponding eigenfunctions are regular at all singular points. The maximal growth rates are contoured as functions of the PV and ocean depth for azimuthal wavenumbers 2 and 3 and the maximum of these growth rates is of the order of 1 day, which is similar to that of a solidly rotating eddy. The range of angular velocity and ocean depth where the constant PV eddy is unstable, however, is greatly reduced compared with that of a solidly rotating eddy. The instabilities found here are classified in terms of wave\u2013wave interactions by comparing our results in each PV value with the known instabilities of the solidly rotating eddy with the same angular velocity. In the constant PV eddy the Baroclinic instability is filtered out and the range of angular velocity where the Hybrid instability exists is significantly reduced. All instabilities decay monotonically with the increase in ocean depth.\n",

Results demonstrate that this fog event included the formation of radiation fog over a continental zone and its extension to the coastal zone through the lowering of low-stratus clouds, which is in agreement with observations and is captured well by the Meso-NH model. Sensitivity experiments show that coastal fog prediction improves with improved sea-surface temperature.

        "description": "\nVariational methods are widely used to solve geophysical inverse problems. Although gradient-based minimization algorithms are available for high-dimensional problems (dimension >106), they do not provide an estimate of the errors in the optimal solution. In this study, we assess the performance of several numerical methods to approximate the analysis-error covariance matrix, assuming reasonably linear models. The evaluation is performed for a CO2 flux estimation problem using synthetic remote-sensing observations of CO2 columns. A low-dimensional experiment is considered in order to compare the analysis error approximations to a full-rank finite-difference inverse Hessian estimate, followed by a realistic high-dimensional application. Two stochastic approaches, a Monte-Carlo simulation and a method based on random gradients of the cost function, produced analysis error variances with a relative error <10%. The long-distance error correlations due to sampling noise are significantly less pronounced for the gradient-based randomization, which is also particularly attractive when implemented in parallel. Deterministic evaluations of the inverse Hessian using the Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno (BFGS) algorithm are also tested. While existing BFGS preconditioning techniques yield poor approximations of the error variances (relative error >120%), a new preconditioner that efficiently accumulates information on the diagonal of the inverse Hessian dramatically improves the results (relative error <50%). Furthermore, performing several cycles of the BFGS algorithm using the same gradient and vector pairs enhances its performance (relative error <30%) and is necessary to obtain convergence. Leveraging those findings, we proposed a BFGS hybrid approach which combines the new preconditioner with several BFGS cycles using information from a few (3\u20135) Monte-Carlo simulations. Its performance is comparable to the stochastic approximations for the low-dimensional case, while good scalability is obtained for the high-dimensional experiment. Potential applications of these new BFGS methods range from characterizing the information content of high-dimensional inverse problems to improving the convergence rate of current minimization algorithms.\n",

        "description": "\nAlpine heavy precipitation events often affect small catchments, although the circulation pattern leading to the event extends over the entire North Atlantic. The various scale interactions involved are particularly challenging for the numerical weather prediction of such events. Unlike previous studies focusing on the southern Alps, here a comprehensive study of a heavy precipitation event in the northern Alps in October 2011 is presented with particular focus on the role of the large-scale circulation in the North Atlantic/European region. During the event exceptionally high amounts of total precipitable water occurred in and north of the Alps. This moisture was initially transported along the flanks of a blocking ridge over the North Atlantic. Subsequently, strong and persistent northerly flow established at the upstream flank of a trough over Europe and steered the moisture towards the northern Alps. Lagrangian diagnostics reveal that a large fraction of the moisture emerged from the West African coast where a subtropical upper-level cut-off low served as an important moisture collector. Wave activity flux diagnostics show that the ridge was initiated as part of a low-frequency, large-scale Rossby wave train while convergence of fast transients helped to amplify it locally in the North Atlantic. A novel diagnostic for advective potential vorticity tendencies sheds more light on this amplification and further emphasizes the role of the ridge in amplifying the trough over Europe. Operational forecasts misrepresented the amplitude and orientation of this trough.\nFor the first time, this study documents an important pathway for northern Alpine flooding, in which the interaction of synoptic-scale to large-scale weather systems and of long-range moisture transport from the Tropics are dominant. Moreover, the trapping of moisture in a subtropical cut-off near the West African coast is found to be a crucial precursor to the observed European high-impact weather.\n",

The climatology shows that a size-based classification between mesoscale precipitation features (MPF) and isolated precipitation reveals distinct seasonal and diurnal variability of precipitation. On average, from 70 to 90% of precipitation is associated with MPF, generally less in the summertime and in southern coastal regions. MPF precipitation has a relatively small seasonal cycle except in Florida and the warm offshore waters of the Gulf Stream. In contrast, isolated precipitation has a dramatic seasonal cycle that outlines the SE USA coastline whereas the MPF precipitation does not, consistent with a thermodynamic mechanism for onshore isolated storms in coastal regions. In summer, the isolated precipitation preferentially forms offshore at night, and dramatically \u2018flips\u2019 inland by early afternoon. In contrast, MPF precipitation has no clear diurnal variations except in the southern coastal region in the summer, likely associated with sea breeze convection organized on the mesoscale. These results suggest that the MPF versus isolated precipitation system framework provides a useful basis for future studies of large-scale and local controls on precipitation and resulting implications for long-range predictability of precipitation.\n",
