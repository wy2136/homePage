Central Asia, an area that is relatively understudied in this regard, is anticipated to be affected by dust storms due to its proximity to several major deserts that are in and generally surround Central Asia (e.g., the Aral Sea region, the Taklimakan desert in Western China). To investigate the relative importance of mineral dust (dust specifically composed of soil related minerals and oxides) in Central Asia, PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> and PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf>, and by difference, coarse particles (particles with diameters between 2.5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm) were measured at two sites, Bishkek and Lidar Station Teplokluchenka (Lidar), in the Kyrgyz Republic. Samples were collected every other day from July 2008 to July 2009. Daily samples were analyzed for mass and organic and elemental carbon. Samples were also composited on a bi-weekly basis and analyzed for elemental constituents and ionic components. In addition, samples collected on days with relatively high and low PM concentrations were analyzed before, and separately, from the biweekly composites to investigate the chemical differences between the episodic events. Data from the episodic samples were averaged into the composited averages. Using the elemental component data, several observational models were examined to estimate the contribution of mineral dust to ambient PM levels.

The complementary tests provide summary information about the source apportionment results as a whole. The preliminary tests check whether source/factors belong to a given source category. Three types of indicators: Pearson correlation (Pearson), standardized identity distance (SID), and weighted difference (WD) are used to test factor/source chemical profiles, while factor/source time series and contribution-to-species values are tested only using the Pearson. The performance tests, based on international standards for proficiency testing, are targeted at evaluating whether the reported biases in the quantification of the factor/source contribution estimates (SCEs) and uncertainties are consistent with previously established quality standards in a fitness-for-purpose approach.

The site is just east of ship and marine emission sources and is also influenced by continental pollution and wildfires, such as those near the California\u2013Oregon border which occurred near the end of NiCE. Two micro-orifice uniform deposit impactors (MOUDIs) were used, and water-soluble and elemental compositions were measured. The five most abundant water-soluble species (in decreasing order) were chloride, sodium, non-sea salt (nss) sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate. During wildfire periods, nss K mass concentrations were not enhanced as strongly as other species in the sub-micrometer stages and even decreased in the super-micrometer stages; species other than nss K are more reliable tracers for biomass burning in this region. Chloride levels were reduced in the fire sets likely due to chloride depletion by inorganic and organic acids that exhibited elevated levels in transported plumes. During wildfire periods, the mass size distribution of most dicarboxylic acids changed from unimodal to bimodal with peaks in the 0.32\u00a0\u03bcm and 1.0\u20131.8\u00a0\u03bcm stages. Furthermore, sulfate's peak concentration shifted from the 0.32\u00a0\u03bcm to 0.56\u00a0\u03bcm stage, and nitrate also shifted to larger sizes (1.0\u00a0\u03bcm to 1.8\u20133.2\u00a0\u03bcm stages). Mass concentrations of numerous soil tracer species (e.g., Si, Fe) were strongly enhanced in samples influenced by wildfires, especially in the sub-micrometer range. Airborne cloud water data confirm that soil species were associated with fire plumes transported south along the coast. In the absence of biomass burning, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) composition is dominated by nss sulfate and ammonium, and the water-soluble organic fraction is dominated by methanesulfonate, whereas for the samples influenced by wildfires, ammonium becomes the dominant overall species, and oxalate is the most abundant organic species.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

While local weather and mixing layer dynamics mainly drive the dispersion of sources at small scales, long-range transports affect the movements of air masses over regional, transboundary and even continental scales. Long-range transport may advect polluted air masses from hot-spots by increasing the levels of pollution at nearby or remote locations or may further raise air pollution levels where external air masses originate from other hot-spots. Therefore, the knowledge of ground-wind circulation and potential long-range transports is fundamental not only to evaluate how local or external sources may affect the air quality at a receptor site but also to quantify it. This review is focussed on establishing the relationships among PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> sources, meteorological condition and air mass origin in the Po Valley, which is one of the most polluted areas in Europe. We have chosen the results from a recent study carried out in Venice (Eastern Po Valley) and have analysed them using different statistical approaches to understand the influence of external and local contribution of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> sources. External contributions were evaluated by applying Trajectory Statistical Methods (TSMs) based on back-trajectory analysis including (i) back-trajectories cluster analysis, (ii) potential source contribution function (PSCF) and (iii) concentration weighted trajectory (CWT).

The numerical results suggest that the surface temperature is strongly affected by the haze-fog condition. Surface heating induced by the solar radiation is enhanced by haze-fog, as higher surface temperature is observed under thicker haze-fog condition. Moreover, the temperature difference between sunlit and shadow surfaces is reduced, while that for the two shadow surfaces is slightly increased. Therefore, the surface temperature among street canyon facets becomes more evenly distributed under heavy haze-fog conditions. In addition, flow patterns are considerably altered by different haze-fog conditions, especially for the afternoon (1600 LST) case, in which thermal-driven flow has opposite direction as that of the wind-driven flow direction. Consequently, pollutants such as vehicular emissions will accumulate at pedestrian level, and pedestrian thermal comfort may lower under thicker haze-fog condition.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To quantify air quality impacts of airport-related hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), we carried out a fine-scale (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km horizontal resolution) Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) model simulation at the T.F. Green airport in Providence (PVD), Rhode Island. We considered temporally and spatially resolved aircraft emissions from the new Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). These model predictions were then evaluated with observations from a field campaign focused on assessing HAPs near the PVD airport. The annual normalized mean error (NME) was in the range of 36\u201370% normalized mean error for all HAPs except for acrolein (&amp;gt;70%). The addition of highly resolved aircraft emissions showed only marginally incremental improvements in performance (1\u20132% decrease in NME) of some HAPs (formaldehyde, xylene). When compared to a coarser 36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036\u00a0km grid resolution, the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km grid resolution did improve performance by up to 5\u201320% NME for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The change in power setting (from traditional International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 7% to observation studies based 4%) doubled the aircraft idling emissions of HAPs, but led to only a 2% decrease in NME. Overall modeled aircraft-attributable contributions are in the range of 0.5\u201328% near a mid-sized airport grid-cell with maximum impacts seen only within 4\u201316\u00a0km from the airport grid-cell. Comparison of CMAQ predictions with HAP estimates from EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) did show similar annual mean concentrations and equally poor performance. Current estimates of HAPs for PVD are a challenge for modeling systems and refinements in our ability to simulate aircraft emissions have made only incremental improvements. Even with unrealistic increases in HAPs aviation emissions the model could not match observed concentrations near the runway airport site. Our results suggest other uncertainties in the modeling system such as meteorology, HAPs chemistry, or other emission sources require increased scrutiny.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The comparisons between the model simulations and the observed AOD at the Solar Village AERONET site and the MODIS measurements show that WRF-Chem satisfactorily resolves the arrival, evolution and spatial distributions of the dust storm over Saudi Arabia especially for the fine domain at 7.2\u00a0km resolution. The model simulated surface meteorological variables at Riyadh Airport, Hafr Al-Batin Airport, Dammam Airport and Gassim Airport follow the observations in terms of magnitude and temporal evolution although model biases such as deficiencies in simulating the amplitude of diurnal cycles are noted. Higher resolution and shorter initialization time improve the model performance in aerosol optical depth but for surface variables shorter initialization time improves correlation while higher horizontal resolution improves mean biases to some extent. The simulated dust plume is mainly confined between the surface and the 5-km height, with the peak concentrations located in the lowest 500\u00a0m. The vertical extent of the dust plume shows gradual decreases during the simulation period when averaged over the entire fine domain and an area centered around Solar Village, and also varies in accordance with the development and decay of the boundary layer.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Incorporation of anthropogenic heating data as inputs to existing climate modeling systems has direct societal implications ranging from improved prediction of energy demand to health assessment, but such data are lacking for most cities. To address this deficiency we have applied a standardized procedure to develop a national database of seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for 61 of the largest cities in the United Stated (U.S.). Recognizing the importance of spatial scale, the anthropogenic heating database developed includes the city scale and the accompanying greater metropolitan area. Our analysis reveals that a single profile function can adequately represent anthropogenic heating during summer but two profile functions are required in winter, one for warm climate cities and another for cold climate cities. On average, although anthropogenic heating is 40% larger in winter than summer, the electricity sector contribution peaks during summer and is smallest in winter. Because such data are similarly required for international cities where urban climate assessments are also ongoing, we have made a simple adjustment accounting for different international energy consumption rates relative to the U.S. to generate seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for a range of global cities. The methodological approach presented here is flexible and straightforwardly applicable to cities not modeled because of presently unavailable data. Because of the anticipated increase in global urban populations for many decades to come, characterizing this fundamental aspect of the urban environment \u2013 anthropogenic heating \u2013 is an essential element toward continued progress in urban climate assessment.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To address that issue, to date, a series of studies is in progress, including PM monitoring programs, PM source apportionment, and the enactment of new ambient air quality index standards. However, related research concerning computer modeling for PM future trends estimation is rare, despite its significance to forecasting and early warning systems. Thereby, a study regarding deterministic and interval forecasts of PM is performed. In this study, data on hourly and 12\u00a0h-averaged air pollutants are applied to forecast PM concentrations within the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China. The characteristics of PM emissions have been primarily examined and analyzed using different distribution functions. To improve the distribution fitting that is crucial for estimating PM levels, an artificial intelligence algorithm is incorporated to select the optimal parameters. Following that step, an ANF model is used to conduct deterministic forecasts of PM. With the identified distributions and deterministic forecasts, different levels of PM intervals are estimated. The results indicate that the lognormal or gamma distributions are highly representative of the recorded PM data with a goodness-of-fit <italic>R</italic> <sup loc=\"post\"> <italic>2</italic> </sup> of approximately 0.998.

A number of on-road studies using vehicle-based mobile monitoring have been conducted to address this. Most previous studies were conducted on urban roads in developed countries where the primary emission source was vehicles. Few studies have examined on-road pollution in developing countries in urban settings. Currently, no study has been conducted for roadways in rural environments where a substantial proportion of the population live. This study aimed to characterize on-road air quality on the East\u2013West Highway (EWH) in Bhutan and identify its principal sources. We conducted six mobile measurements of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf>, particle number (PN) count and CO along the entire 570\u00a0km length of the EWH. We divided the EWH into five segments, R1\u2013R5, taking the road length between two district towns as a single road segment. The pollutant concentrations varied widely along the different road segments, with the highest concentrations for R5 compared with other road segments (PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf>\u00a0=\u00a0149\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>, PN\u00a0=\u00a05.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup loc=\"post\">4</sup> particles/cm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup>, CO\u00a0=\u00a00.19\u00a0ppm), which is the final segment of the road to the capital.

Overall, the highest contributions above the background levels were made by unpaved roads for PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> (6 times background), and vehicle emissions for PN and CO (5 and 15 times background, respectively). Notwithstanding the differences in instrumentation used and particle size range measured, the current study showed lower PN concentrations compared with similar on-road studies. However, concentrations were still high enough that commuters, road maintenance workers and residents living along the EWH, were potentially exposed to elevated pollutant concentrations from combustion and non-combustion sources. Future studies should focus on assessing the dispersion patterns of roadway pollutants and defining the short- and long-term health impacts of exposure in Bhutan, as well as in other developing countries with similar characteristics.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this work, sources of OC and EC are investigated using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> chemical composition data, including major ions, OC, EC, elements, and organic molecular source markers, for a set of 156 filter samples collected over three years from 2010 to 2012 at Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta, China.

The three PM fractions were analysed for major and minor elements, secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and total carbon (TC). Measurements were performed both when the metro was inoperative and closed to the public (referred to as background), and when the metro was in operation and open to passengers. PM concentrations were elevated during both periods, but were substantially increased in the coarse fraction during hours when the metro was in operation.

Results indicate that gas flaring is a major contributor to air pollution across the region, with concentrations exceeding WHO limits in some locations over certain time periods. Due to the predominant south-westerly wind, concentrations are higher in some states with little flaring activity than in others with significant flaring activity. Twenty million people inhabit areas of high flare-associated air pollution, which include all of the main ecological zones of the region, indicating that flaring poses a substantial threat to human health and the environment.

Previous studies have demonstrated that EC particles in the PRD region undergo significant amounts of aging processes. To assess the degree of aging, the real-time single particle volatility of EC-containing particles was measured in an urban area of the PRD region by a thermodiluter coupled to a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). The size and chemical composition of the individual particles before and after heating to 75\u00a0\u00b0C, 150\u00a0\u00b0C and 300\u00a0\u00b0C were characterized. Of the total unheated particles examined by SPAMS, 53% of the unheated particles contained EC, and a higher number fraction (69%) was observed in the particles heated to 300\u00a0\u00b0C. No significant differences in the mass spectral patterns were found between ambient temperature and 75\u00a0\u00b0C. Nitrate evaporated at 150\u00a0\u00b0C, and most of sulfate evaporated at 300\u00a0\u00b0C. EC-containing particles were clustered into four distinct particle types based on the dominant chemical species present in the mass spectra, comprised of EC, internally mixed EC and organic carbon (OC) (ECOC), internally mixed EC and sodium/potassium salt (NaK\u2013EC), and internally mixed EC and metal species (Metal\u2013EC). Detail analysis show that the volatility of EC-containing particles relied on the EC particle types. Among the four types, the EC type was quite volatile. A significant fraction of sulfate and organics in the ECOC type did not volatilize at 300\u00a0\u00b0C. The volatilities of secondary ions in the four EC-containing particle types were found to be dependent on their molecular composition. Additionally, the volatility of EC-containing particles decreased during the polluted hazy days due to the generation of low volatile compounds under the atmospheric conditions with higher precursor concentrations and oxidation capacity. To our knowledge, this is the first reported real-time volatility measurements of individual ambient aerosols in the PRD region. These findings provide an improved understanding of the aging process of EC particles, and may help in the modeling of its climate impact.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

On haze days, airborne microorganisms are considered to be a potential risk factor for various health concerns. However, limited information on bioaerosols has prevented our proper understanding of the possible threat to human health due to these bioaerosols. In this study, we used a six-stage impactor for sampling culturable bioaerosols and the LUDEP 2.07 computer-based model for calculating their deposition on human lungs to investigate seasonal concentration, size distribution, and corresponding deposition efficiency and flux in the human respiratory tract during different haze-level events. The current results of the analysis of 398 samples over four seasons indicate that the concentration of culturable airborne bacteria decreased with increasing haze severity. The bioaerosol concentration ratio was skewed towards larger particle sizes on heavy haze days leading to larger bioaerosol aerodynamic diameters than on non-haze days. During nasal breathing by an adult male engaged in light exercise in an outdoor environment, the total deposition efficiency of culturable bioaerosols is 80\u201390% including approximately 70% in the upper respiratory tract, 5\u20137% in the alveoli, and about 3% in the bronchial couple with bronchiolar regions. Although the difference in culturable bioaerosol aerodynamic diameters at different haze levels was not large enough to cause obvious differences in lung deposition efficiency, the deposition fluxes clearly varied with the degree of haze owing to the varied concentration of culturable airborne bacteria and fungi. The results here could improve our understanding of the seasonal health threat due to culturable bioaerosols during non-haze and haze days.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This is one of the hotspots in Europe for air quality, where efforts to meet the European standard for PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> according to current and future legislation have been generally unsuccessful. Recent data indicating that ammonium, nitrate and sulphate account for about one third of total PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> mass show that secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) plays a key role in the exceedence of the standards. A sampling campaign for PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> was carried out simultaneously in six major cities (2012\u20132013). The water soluble inorganic ions were quantified and data processed to: (1) investigate the seasonal trends and the spatial variations of the ionic component of aerosol; (2) identify chemical characteristics at the regional-scale and (3) assess the potential effects of long-range transport using back-trajectory cluster analysis and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models. Results indicated that PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> and SIA ions have an increasing gradient in concentrations from North (mountain) to South (lowland) and from East (coastal) to West (more continental), whereas K<sup loc=\"post\">+</sup> and Ca<sup loc=\"post\">2+</sup> levels are quite uniformly distributed. Similar seasonal trends in PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> and ions are seen across the region. Simultaneous daily changes were observed and interpreted as a consequence of similar emission sources, secondary pollutant generation and accumulation/removal processes. Sulphate and nitrate were not directly related to the concentrations of their precursor gases and were generally largely, but not completely, neutralised by ammonium. The clustering of back-trajectories and CWT demonstrate that the long-range movement of the air masses has a major impact upon PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> and ion concentrations: an area spreading from Eastern to Central Europe was identified as a main potential source for most ions. The valley sites are also heavily influenced by local emissions in slow moving northerly air masses. Finally, two episodes of high nitrate levels were investigated to explain why some sites are experiencing much higher concentrations than others. This study identifies some key features in the generation of SIA in the Po Valley, demonstrating that SIA generation is a regional pollution phenomenon and mitigation policies are required at regional, national and even European scales.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1352231015301862-fx1.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"487\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

We investigated the impact of biomass burning through molecular markers on the concentration of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> aerosol samples collected from a rural site in eastern central India during three episodic periods from October to November 2011. The collected PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> samples were chemically quantified for potassium as well as sugars and dicarboxylic acids using ion chromatography. Levoglucosan and glucose were found as the most abundant sugar compounds and sugar-alcohols showed the predominance of mannitol whereas oxalic acid was the most abundant diacid followed by maleic acid in PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> aerosols. Substantially enhanced concentrations of K<sup loc=\"post\">+</sup> as well as levoglucosan and glucose were observed in eastern central India. Analysis of the source specific molecular markers and ratios of sugars and diacids infer that combustion of biomass was the major emission sources of organic compounds associated with PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> aerosols over eastern central India. We applied Spearman correlation analysis and principal component analysis to further investigate the sources of measured sugars and diacids. The concentrations of K<sup loc=\"post\">+</sup> and levoglucosan were significantly correlated with sugars and diacids that verifying their common sources from biomass burning emission. This study demonstrates that biomass burning for domestic heating and cooking purposes and agricultural activities significantly influence the air quality of eastern central India during the investigation period.

The model considers the development of a worst-case scenario similar to that occurred at Bhopal. Fully developed clouds of a dense gas having different densities, under ABL (Atmospheric Boundary Layer) with calm ground wind conditions are first obtained. These clouds are then allowed to spread under ABL with different ground wind speeds and gravity conditions. The developed model is validated by performing the grid independent study, the fluid dynamical evidences, post-disaster facts, the downwind MIC (Methyl Isocynate) concentrations estimated by earlier models and experiments on dense plume trajectories. It is shown that in case of an active dispersion under calm wind conditions the lateral spread would prevail over the downwind spread. The presence of a dense medium behaves like a weak porous media and initiates turbulence at much smaller downwind distances than that normally would occur without the dense medium. The safety distances from toxic exposures of MIC are predicted by specifying an isosurface of a minimum concentration above the ground surface. Discrepancies in near-field predictions still exist.

A fundamental mechanistic model to characterize the air sampling process with filter-sorbent samplers for SVOCs was developed and partially validated. The potential sampling artifacts associated with measurements of gas-particle partitioning were examined for 19 SVOCs. Positive sampling bias (i.e., overestimation of gas/particle partition coefficients) was observed for almost all the SVOCs. For certain compounds, the measured partition coefficient was several orders of magnitude greater than the presumed value.

Penetration of particles into the sorbent may result in significant underestimation of the partition coefficient for particles in the size range between 10\u00a0nm and 2\u00a0\u03bcm. For most of the selected compounds, backup filters can be used to correct artifacts effectively. However, for some compounds with very low vapor pressure, the artifacts remained or became even larger than they were without the backup filter. Thus, the option of backup filters must be considered carefully in field measurements of the gas/particle partitioning of SVOCs. The results of this work will allow researchers to predict potential artifacts associated with SVOC gas/particle partitioning as functions of compounds, the concentration of particles, the distribution of particle sizes, sampling velocity, and sampling time.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Ozone data are grouped and analysed according to the air-mass residence time over the central India, marine region and Africa/Middle East regions. Ozone shows a linear dependence on air-mass residence time over the central India region for about six days. Rate of ozone increase is maximum during summer (boundary layer\u00a06.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0ppbv/day, lower free troposphere\u00a02.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ppbv/day) and minimum during winter (boundary layer\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ppbv/day, lower free troposphere\u00a00.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0ppbv/day). The background ozone is estimated by extrapolating the linear regression line to zeroth residence day and is found to be significantly lower during summer/monsoon (15.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0ppbv) within the boundary layer due to influence of marine air-mass. Monthly variation of the boundary layer ozone shows a distinct peak during March\u2013April months. Simultaneous investigation of fire counts and potential source contribution function analysis confirms that Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) outflow has a significant contribution in ozone enhancement over even at this southern region throughout the year except in summer-monsoon season. The ozone in regionally polluted air masses influenced by the central Indian region is found to be higher than average ozone by 6\u201315% within the boundary layer and by 5\u20139% in the lower troposphere during different seasons. The marine air shows a lower ozone level by 4\u201328\u00a0ppbv throughout the year within the boundary layer. Role of long-range transport from Africa/Middle East is found to be significant in the lower troposphere and shows 4.4\u00a0ppbv and 9\u00a0ppbv higher ozone mixing ratio during summer and autumn, respectively.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Speciation data at Fukuoka indicated that approximately 99% of the atmospheric mercury was in the gaseous elemental form. The average concentration of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) at Fukuoka was slightly higher than that of total gaseous mercury (TGM) at Minamata. Synchronous pollution events of higher concentrations of both GEM at Fukuoka and TGM at Minamata were frequently observed from late fall to early spring. We infer that these events occurred due to long-range transport of mercury rather than local, domestic emission sources because the two sites are far apart (about 150\u00a0km), and local sources would be unlikely to synchronously influence concentrations at both sites over such a long distance. The results of backward trajectory analyses indicated that these events occurred when air masses came from the Asian continent. In addition, the pollution events were often the result of cold fronts or migratory anticyclones that passed over the Kyushu Islands, often accompanied by descending cool and heavy air currents. Thus, these results indicate that, under specific climate conditions, higher concentrations of atmospheric mercury are transported to the Kyushu Islands from the Asian continent, and are evident in ground-based observations there.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
