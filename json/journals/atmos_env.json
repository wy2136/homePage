Central Asia, an area that is relatively understudied in this regard, is anticipated to be affected by dust storms due to its proximity to several major deserts that are in and generally surround Central Asia (e.g., the Aral Sea region, the Taklimakan desert in Western China). To investigate the relative importance of mineral dust (dust specifically composed of soil related minerals and oxides) in Central Asia, PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> and PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf>, and by difference, coarse particles (particles with diameters between 2.5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm) were measured at two sites, Bishkek and Lidar Station Teplokluchenka (Lidar), in the Kyrgyz Republic. Samples were collected every other day from July 2008 to July 2009. Daily samples were analyzed for mass and organic and elemental carbon. Samples were also composited on a bi-weekly basis and analyzed for elemental constituents and ionic components. In addition, samples collected on days with relatively high and low PM concentrations were analyzed before, and separately, from the biweekly composites to investigate the chemical differences between the episodic events. Data from the episodic samples were averaged into the composited averages. Using the elemental component data, several observational models were examined to estimate the contribution of mineral dust to ambient PM levels.

The complementary tests provide summary information about the source apportionment results as a whole. The preliminary tests check whether source/factors belong to a given source category. Three types of indicators: Pearson correlation (Pearson), standardized identity distance (SID), and weighted difference (WD) are used to test factor/source chemical profiles, while factor/source time series and contribution-to-species values are tested only using the Pearson. The performance tests, based on international standards for proficiency testing, are targeted at evaluating whether the reported biases in the quantification of the factor/source contribution estimates (SCEs) and uncertainties are consistent with previously established quality standards in a fitness-for-purpose approach.

The site is just east of ship and marine emission sources and is also influenced by continental pollution and wildfires, such as those near the California\u2013Oregon border which occurred near the end of NiCE. Two micro-orifice uniform deposit impactors (MOUDIs) were used, and water-soluble and elemental compositions were measured. The five most abundant water-soluble species (in decreasing order) were chloride, sodium, non-sea salt (nss) sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate. During wildfire periods, nss K mass concentrations were not enhanced as strongly as other species in the sub-micrometer stages and even decreased in the super-micrometer stages; species other than nss K are more reliable tracers for biomass burning in this region. Chloride levels were reduced in the fire sets likely due to chloride depletion by inorganic and organic acids that exhibited elevated levels in transported plumes. During wildfire periods, the mass size distribution of most dicarboxylic acids changed from unimodal to bimodal with peaks in the 0.32\u00a0\u03bcm and 1.0\u20131.8\u00a0\u03bcm stages. Furthermore, sulfate's peak concentration shifted from the 0.32\u00a0\u03bcm to 0.56\u00a0\u03bcm stage, and nitrate also shifted to larger sizes (1.0\u00a0\u03bcm to 1.8\u20133.2\u00a0\u03bcm stages). Mass concentrations of numerous soil tracer species (e.g., Si, Fe) were strongly enhanced in samples influenced by wildfires, especially in the sub-micrometer range. Airborne cloud water data confirm that soil species were associated with fire plumes transported south along the coast. In the absence of biomass burning, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) composition is dominated by nss sulfate and ammonium, and the water-soluble organic fraction is dominated by methanesulfonate, whereas for the samples influenced by wildfires, ammonium becomes the dominant overall species, and oxalate is the most abundant organic species.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

While local weather and mixing layer dynamics mainly drive the dispersion of sources at small scales, long-range transports affect the movements of air masses over regional, transboundary and even continental scales. Long-range transport may advect polluted air masses from hot-spots by increasing the levels of pollution at nearby or remote locations or may further raise air pollution levels where external air masses originate from other hot-spots. Therefore, the knowledge of ground-wind circulation and potential long-range transports is fundamental not only to evaluate how local or external sources may affect the air quality at a receptor site but also to quantify it. This review is focussed on establishing the relationships among PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> sources, meteorological condition and air mass origin in the Po Valley, which is one of the most polluted areas in Europe. We have chosen the results from a recent study carried out in Venice (Eastern Po Valley) and have analysed them using different statistical approaches to understand the influence of external and local contribution of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> sources.

In this study, light extinction coefficient (<italic>K</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>ex</italic> </inf>) is adopted to represent haze-fog pollution level. Numerical simulations are performed for different <italic>K</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>ex</italic> </inf> values at four representative time events (1000 LST, 1300 LST, 1600 LST and 2000 LST). The numerical results suggest that the surface temperature is strongly affected by the haze-fog condition. Surface heating induced by the solar radiation is enhanced by haze-fog, as higher surface temperature is observed under thicker haze-fog condition. Moreover, the temperature difference between sunlit and shadow surfaces is reduced, while that for the two shadow surfaces is slightly increased. Therefore, the surface temperature among street canyon facets becomes more evenly distributed under heavy haze-fog conditions. In addition, flow patterns are considerably altered by different haze-fog conditions, especially for the afternoon (1600 LST) case, in which thermal-driven flow has opposite direction as that of the wind-driven flow direction. Consequently, pollutants such as vehicular emissions will accumulate at pedestrian level, and pedestrian thermal comfort may lower under thicker haze-fog condition.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To quantify air quality impacts of airport-related hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), we carried out a fine-scale (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km horizontal resolution) Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) model simulation at the T.F. Green airport in Providence (PVD), Rhode Island. We considered temporally and spatially resolved aircraft emissions from the new Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). These model predictions were then evaluated with observations from a field campaign focused on assessing HAPs near the PVD airport. The annual normalized mean error (NME) was in the range of 36\u201370% normalized mean error for all HAPs except for acrolein (&amp;gt;70%). The addition of highly resolved aircraft emissions showed only marginally incremental improvements in performance (1\u20132% decrease in NME) of some HAPs (formaldehyde, xylene). When compared to a coarser 36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036\u00a0km grid resolution, the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km grid resolution did improve performance by up to 5\u201320% NME for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The change in power setting (from traditional International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 7% to observation studies based 4%) doubled the aircraft idling emissions of HAPs, but led to only a 2% decrease in NME. Overall modeled aircraft-attributable contributions are in the range of 0.5\u201328% near a mid-sized airport grid-cell with maximum impacts seen only within 4\u201316\u00a0km from the airport grid-cell. Comparison of CMAQ predictions with HAP estimates from EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) did show similar annual mean concentrations and equally poor performance. Current estimates of HAPs for PVD are a challenge for modeling systems and refinements in our ability to simulate aircraft emissions have made only incremental improvements. Even with unrealistic increases in HAPs aviation emissions the model could not match observed concentrations near the runway airport site. Our results suggest other uncertainties in the modeling system such as meteorology, HAPs chemistry, or other emission sources require increased scrutiny.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The comparisons between the model simulations and the observed AOD at the Solar Village AERONET site and the MODIS measurements show that WRF-Chem satisfactorily resolves the arrival, evolution and spatial distributions of the dust storm over Saudi Arabia especially for the fine domain at 7.2\u00a0km resolution. The model simulated surface meteorological variables at Riyadh Airport, Hafr Al-Batin Airport, Dammam Airport and Gassim Airport follow the observations in terms of magnitude and temporal evolution although model biases such as deficiencies in simulating the amplitude of diurnal cycles are noted. Higher resolution and shorter initialization time improve the model performance in aerosol optical depth but for surface variables shorter initialization time improves correlation while higher horizontal resolution improves mean biases to some extent. The simulated dust plume is mainly confined between the surface and the 5-km height, with the peak concentrations located in the lowest 500\u00a0m. The vertical extent of the dust plume shows gradual decreases during the simulation period when averaged over the entire fine domain and an area centered around Solar Village, and also varies in accordance with the development and decay of the boundary layer.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Two empirical methods to quantify the impact of meteorology on pollutant levels are discussed and applied to the 13-year time period between 2000 and 2012 in Atlanta, GA. The methods employ Kolmogorov\u2013Zurbenko filters and linear regressions to detrended pollutant signals into long-term, seasonal, weekly, short-term, and white-noise components.

In order to gain more knowledge of emission factors for road traffic and concentrations of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> and PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf>, existing monitoring stations in two cities, Gothenburg and Ume\u00e5, with international E-road thoroughfares, were complemented with some PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> measurements. Emission factors for PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> and PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> were estimated using NO<inf loc=\"post\">X</inf> as a tracer.

The underlying hypothesis is that the composition of individual particles is a metric of particle source and thus sampling particles based on composition should be synonymous with sampling based on source. System operation relies on real-time pattern recognition to control the actuation of different ChemVol samplers, where each ChemVol is associated with a unique composition signature. In the current work, a synthesis of data collected during these studies is used in retrospect to reconcile the actual source combinations contributing to the particles collected by each ChemVol. Source attribution is based on correlations between ChemVol sampling periods and coincident wind direction and temporal emissions patterns, coupled to knowledge of single particle composition and surrounding sources. Residential and commercial cooking, vehicular emissions, residential heating and highly processed regional background PM were identified as the major sources. Results show that real-time patterns in single particle mixing state correctly identified specific sources and that these sources were successfully separated into different ChemVols for both summer and winter seasons.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S135223101530296X-fx1.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"370\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study uses long (20- and 30-year) simulations to evaluate the present-day performance of the CTMs, which is a necessary first step before undertaking any analysis of future air quality impacts. Two sets of meteorological forcings were used for each model: reanalysis of past observation data (ERA-Interim) and Global Climate Model (GCM) output. The results for the simulations forced by reanalysis data were assessed in relation to AirBase v7 measurement data, and it was determined that all four models slightly overpredict annual O<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> values (mean biases range between 0.7 and 6.6\u00a0ppb) and three out of the four models underpredict observed annual NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> (mean biases range between\u00a0\u22123.1 and\u00a0\u22125.2\u00a0ppb). The simulations forced by climate models result in spatially averaged monthly concentrations of O<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> that are generally between 0 and 5\u00a0ppb higher than the values obtained from simulations forced by reanalysis data; therefore it was concluded that the use of climate models introduces an additional bias to the results, but this bias tends not to be significant in the majority of cases. The bias in O<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> results appears to be correlated mainly to differences in temperature and boundary layer height between the two types of simulations, whereas the less significant bias in NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> is negatively correlated to temperature and boundary layer height. It is also clear that the selection of chemical boundary conditions is an important factor in determining the variability of O<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> model results.

We show that the mean single scattering albedo (SSA) values increase by 0.03\u20130.06 (7%) in APs, and the mean asymmetry (ASY) parameter values increase by 0.03\u20130.04 (6%) for the four wavelengths of 440\u20131020\u00a0nm. The atmospheric forcing of the APs is 2 times higher than that in other days. Contrary to the RF values, the radiative forcing efficiencies in the APs are 38% lower than those in the other days. Larger values of SSA and ASY under APs represent larger presence of more scattering aerosols and irregular-sized aerosols such as dust and non-absorbing fine mode particles. These particles are also verified by the much lower radiative forcing efficiency values. Analyses are applied on the dataset of the APs over Beijing, to group them into four discrete clusters. The two fine-size absorbing aerosols show larger mean atmospheric radiative forcing values (152.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 184.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> respectively) and forcing efficiency values (83.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 108.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> respectively). The non-absorbing aerosols and coarse aerosols exert large planetary cooling (\u221286.7\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and\u00a0\u221277.3\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>) and low atmospheric heating effect.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We used soil and leaves as receptors for atmospheric particulate matter to test the efficiency of magnetic approach for assessing and discriminating past and present pollution. The results indicate that strong magnetic particles in topsoil and leaf samples are mainly low-coercivity magnetite, occurring in a larger grain-size range than in background soil, which is helpful to separate anthropogenic and natural sources. Topsoil magnetic signals reflect pollutants, which accumulated over the last decades. Differences in the vertical distribution of magnetic properties between undisturbed and disturbed (cultivated) soil profiles show that the plowing depth is the most important factor for migration of pollutants in cultivated soils. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) values of leaf samples reflect the present state of pollution and can even trace seasonal changes. Spatial maps of MS identify differences of the past and present environmental conditions caused by the shutdown of industrial sites within the last decade. Correlation coefficients between analyzed HM contents (Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb) and MS values are significantly positive in leaf samples, and still moderate in topsoil samples.

In addition, the heavy haze events that occurred in January 2013 over eastern China are explored using AAI products from TOU on board FY-3A. Validation results show that satellite AAI products can be used for haze monitoring since it is sensitive to the carbonaceous aerosol, which is one of the main components of haze. In China, the high AAI values (&amp;gt;1.0) mainly located in the main four areas with intense anthropogenic activities, except for the desert region in Northwestern China. In the eastern and northeastern region, AAI peaks dominate in spring before 2005 since those areas were always affected by dust in spring. However, after 2005, AAI peaks appear in winter over eastern China because of haze. Moreover, in the northeastern region, AAI peaks dominate in winter with a secondary peak in spring because this area is affected by both dust and haze. In the southern region, the AAI peaks always dominate in spring since the high-level air pollution\u00a0often occur in spring, but a decreasing trend is acquired during recent ten years. Over eastern China and northeastern China, AAI shows an increasing trend during recent 30 years in winter, which reveals that the haze over these areas is strengthen.

Incorporation of anthropogenic heating data as inputs to existing climate modeling systems has direct societal implications ranging from improved prediction of energy demand to health assessment, but such data are lacking for most cities. To address this deficiency we have applied a standardized procedure to develop a national database of seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for 61 of the largest cities in the United Stated (U.S.). Recognizing the importance of spatial scale, the anthropogenic heating database developed includes the city scale and the accompanying greater metropolitan area. Our analysis reveals that a single profile function can adequately represent anthropogenic heating during summer but two profile functions are required in winter, one for warm climate cities and another for cold climate cities. On average, although anthropogenic heating is 40% larger in winter than summer, the electricity sector contribution peaks during summer and is smallest in winter. Because such data are similarly required for international cities where urban climate assessments are also ongoing, we have made a simple adjustment accounting for different international energy consumption rates relative to the U.S. to generate seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for a range of global cities. The methodological approach presented here is flexible and straightforwardly applicable to cities not modeled because of presently unavailable data. Because of the anticipated increase in global urban populations for many decades to come, characterizing this fundamental aspect of the urban environment \u2013 anthropogenic heating \u2013 is an essential element toward continued progress in urban climate assessment.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

More importantly, the model is capable of accounting for the evolution of the ABL structure over a diurnal cycle by considering parameterizations for the wind-speed and eddy-diffusivity profiles that depend on the atmospheric stability condition, which in turn undergoes dramatic changes throughout the day. To solve the resulting advection\u2013diffusion equation, we propose a numerical method based on a stabilized finite element formulation.

To address that issue, to date, a series of studies is in progress, including PM monitoring programs, PM source apportionment, and the enactment of new ambient air quality index standards. However, related research concerning computer modeling for PM future trends estimation is rare, despite its significance to forecasting and early warning systems. Thereby, a study regarding deterministic and interval forecasts of PM is performed. In this study, data on hourly and 12\u00a0h-averaged air pollutants are applied to forecast PM concentrations within the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China. The characteristics of PM emissions have been primarily examined and analyzed using different distribution functions. To improve the distribution fitting that is crucial for estimating PM levels, an artificial intelligence algorithm is incorporated to select the optimal parameters. Following that step, an ANF model is used to conduct deterministic forecasts of PM. With the identified distributions and deterministic forecasts, different levels of PM intervals are estimated.

A number of on-road studies using vehicle-based mobile monitoring have been conducted to address this. Most previous studies were conducted on urban roads in developed countries where the primary emission source was vehicles. Few studies have examined on-road pollution in developing countries in urban settings. Currently, no study has been conducted for roadways in rural environments where a substantial proportion of the population live. This study aimed to characterize on-road air quality on the East\u2013West Highway (EWH) in Bhutan and identify its principal sources. We conducted six mobile measurements of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf>, particle number (PN) count and CO along the entire 570\u00a0km length of the EWH. We divided the EWH into five segments, R1\u2013R5, taking the road length between two district towns as a single road segment. The pollutant concentrations varied widely along the different road segments, with the highest concentrations for R5 compared with other road segments (PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf>\u00a0=\u00a0149\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>, PN\u00a0=\u00a05.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup loc=\"post\">4</sup> particles/cm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup>, CO\u00a0=\u00a00.19\u00a0ppm), which is the final segment of the road to the capital. Apart from vehicle emissions, the dominant sources were road works, unpaved roads and roadside combustion activities. Overall, the highest contributions above the background levels were made by unpaved roads for PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> (6 times background), and vehicle emissions for PN and CO (5 and 15 times background, respectively). Notwithstanding the differences in instrumentation used and particle size range measured, the current study showed lower PN concentrations compared with similar on-road studies. However, concentrations were still high enough that commuters, road maintenance workers and residents living along the EWH, were potentially exposed to elevated pollutant concentrations from combustion and non-combustion sources. Future studies should focus on assessing the dispersion patterns of roadway pollutants and defining the short- and long-term health impacts of exposure in Bhutan, as well as in other developing countries with similar characteristics.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this work, sources of OC and EC are investigated using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> chemical composition data, including major ions, OC, EC, elements, and organic molecular source markers, for a set of 156 filter samples collected over three years from 2010 to 2012 at Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta, China. The key organic tracers include levoglucosan, mannosan, hopanes, C<inf loc=\"post\">27</inf>\u2013C<inf loc=\"post\">33</inf> <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using these species as input for the PMF model, nine factors were resolved. Among them, biomass burning and coal combustion were significant sources contributing 15\u201317% of OC and 24\u201330% and 34\u201335% of EC, respectively. Industrial emissions and ship emissions, identified through their characteristic metal signatures, contributed 16\u201324% and 7\u20138% of OC and 8\u201311% and 16\u201317% of EC, respectively. Vehicle exhaust was a less significant source, accounting for 3\u20134% of OC and 5\u20138% of EC. Secondary OC, taken to be the sum of OC present in secondary sulfate and nitrate formation source factors, made up 27\u201336% of OC. Plastic burning, identified through 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene as a tracer, was a less important source for OC(\u22644%) and EC (5\u201310%), but a significant source for PAHs at this site.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">The utility of organic source tracers was demonstrated by comparing PMF runs with different combinations of organic tracers removed from the input species list. Levoglucosan and mannosan were important additions to distinguish biomass burning from coal combustion by reducing collinearity among source profiles. Inclusion of hopanes and 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was found to be necessary in resolving the less significant sources vehicle exhaust and plastic burning. Inclusion of C<inf loc=\"post\">27</inf>\u2013C<inf loc=\"post\">33</inf> <italic>n</italic>-alkanes and PAHs can influence the source profiles resolved by PMF and thereby affect the source contributions to OC and EC. Considerably more OC (44% vs. 27% of OC) was apportioned to the secondary factors when only major components were considered in comparison with the PMF analysis with the full suite of organic tracers, mainly at the expense of coal combustion and industrial emissions. EC apportionment to the few major combustion sources was found more sensitive to inclusion of organic tracers than OC apportionment, with PAHs playing a prominent role. This work demonstrates the importance of having distinct organic tracers in identifying and quantifying OC and EC sources.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The three PM fractions were analysed for major and minor elements, secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and total carbon (TC). Measurements were performed both when the metro was inoperative and closed to the public (referred to as background), and when the metro was in operation and open to passengers. PM concentrations were elevated during both periods, but were substantially increased in the coarse fraction during hours when the metro was in operation. Average PM concentrations were 214.8, 93.9 and 44.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup> for PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf>, PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> and PM<inf loc=\"post\">1</inf>, respectively (determined gravimetrically). Average particle number concentrations were 8.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>\u00a0cm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup> for background hours and 11.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>\u00a0cm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup> during operational hours. Particle number concentrations were found to not vary as significantly as PM concentrations throughout the day. Variations in PM were strongly governed by passing trains, with highest concentrations recorded during rush hour. When trains were less frequent, PM concentrations were shown to fluctuate in unison with the entrance and exit of trains (as shown by wind velocity measured on the platform). PM was found to be highly enriched with iron, especially in the coarse fraction, comprising 46% of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> (98.9\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup>). This reduces to 6.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22123</sup> during background hours, proving that the trains themselves were the main source of iron, most probably from wheel-rail mechanical abrasion. Other enriched elements relative to background hours included Ba, Cu, Mn, Cr, Mo, Ni and Co, among others. Many of these elements exhibited a similar size distribution, further indicating their sources were common and were attributed to train operations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study uses a combination of geospatial technologies and dispersion modelling techniques to evaluate air pollution impacts of gas flaring on human health and natural ecosystems in the region. Results indicate that gas flaring is a major contributor to air pollution across the region, with concentrations exceeding WHO limits in some locations over certain time periods. Due to the predominant south-westerly wind, concentrations are higher in some states with little flaring activity than in others with significant flaring activity. Twenty million people inhabit areas of high flare-associated air pollution, which include all of the main ecological zones of the region, indicating that flaring poses a substantial threat to human health and the environment. Model scenarios demonstrated that substantial reductions in pollution could be achieved by stopping flaring at a small number of the most active sites and by improving overall flaring efficiency.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
