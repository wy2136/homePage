        "description": "\n\nDiscussed in a global context, the issue of scale is important to consider as it relates to climate change. As climatological studies utilize temporally and spatially static definitions of seasonal definitions, the understanding of seasonal change may be limited by the way in which seasons are defined. This research serves as a challenge to this perspective by examining the changes in seasons by incorporating variability into the way in which seasons are defined. Temporally and spatially variable seasons were defined based on thresholds of apparent temperature and upper-level circulation patterns for the period 1948\u20132012. Using 60 US surface stations, two apparent air temperature metrics were used to define seasons that vary spatially and temporally. Stations represented major cities found in the contiguous United States. A large-scale circulation approach utilized synoptic categorizations based on 250-mb geopotential heights from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NNR) as a metric of seasonal delineation. In this method, seasons varied temporally but not spatially. Despite the different methodological approaches, consistent trends were found. Since 1948, late starts of autumn and winter have been observed while earlier onsets of spring and summer have taken place. For the individual stations, the largest shifts occurred along coasts and in larger, more urbanized environments. Individual locations also showed increased variability in start date, and significant changes were found for all four seasons in the circulation approach. Seasons have been shown to be important for a variety of processes including phenological responses and human adaptation to extreme temperature environments; therefore, the consideration of season variability may be appropriate for future climatological research.\n",

Different behaviours of precipitation over AB are found to the north and south of 8\u00b0S when the longitudinal band 70\u00b0\u201350\u00b0W is considered. The sample is then split into northern and southern sectors with respect to 8\u00b0S, describing their monthly evolution as a function of longitude. The main spatial oscillation modes are isolated and analysed through continuous wavelet transform analysis. Intense spatial oscillations are found close to the western side of the studied region. Several temporal modes in different scales are detected within each sample. Two of them show scales longer than 12 months, which are probably associated with ENSO phases. Smaller scale oscillations, evaluated from daily data, are also found. The northern sector of AB shows more daily data variability than the southern one and seems to be more affected by large temporal processes than the southern sector.\n",

This study aims to characterize the climate regimes of each region, seeking the highest degree of regional homogeneity and representativeness of yields and climate variables. The series variability is analysed according to various effects (different stages of crop development and conditioning of yield). The temperatures and rainfall occurring during the flowering stage exert greater conditioning on yield at the end of the crop cycle.

It has been suggested that this warming may increase the frequency or severity of droughts. We define a quantitative and objective aridity index that describes the precipitation forcing function of drought. Using the extensive historical database of precipitation records, we evaluate changes in the aridity in the 48 contiguous United States. The area-averaged mean fractional rate of change of aridity of 1218 sites in the period 1893\u20132013 was (\u22126.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20094 per year; the 48 contiguous United States became less arid. The rate of decrease of aridity was roughly consistent with expectations from the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation and the rate of warming. The fractional rate of change of aridity was nearly uncorrelated with the aridity itself, but there were regional differences: many Western and coastal Southeastern sites showed increasing aridity, but regions of rapidly decreasing aridity were found in a band 85\u2218\u2013100\u2218W and the Northeast.\n",

In this study, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based high-resolution multisatellite rainfall products namely, TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-3B42 and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) are evaluated against recently released gauge-based India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data set. Both the research (delayed mode) and near real-time rainfall products of TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP (MVK and NRT) are evaluated over India at a daily scale for the peak southwest monsoon months of July\u2013August. Two study periods (2000\u20132010 and 2009\u20132013) are used to accommodate the analyses based on data availability. Comparison of TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP-MVK with IMD gauge-based data for 2000\u20132010 shows that these data sets are able to represent large-scale monsoon rainfall spatial features, but are having region-specific biases. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfall averaged over India is also reasonably captured. However in terms of biases, TMPA-3B42RT overestimates rainfall by about 21% and GSMaP-MVK underestimates by about 22% at all-India scale. In terms of continuous skill metrics, TMPA-3B42V7 is closer to the IMD gauge-based observations possibly due to gauge adjustments. Categorical verification against gauge-based observations shows that the satellite-based data sets have difficulties in rainfall detection primarily over the northern Jammu & Kashmir regions, northeast India, and southern peninsular India. At subregional scale within India, satellite rainfall estimates show rather lower skill score in rainfall identification and larger uncertainty in rainfall estimation over the northeast India. Comparison of near real-time products of TMPA and GSMaP for July\u2013August months of 2009\u20132013 shows that TMPA-3B42RT overestimates and GSMaP-NRT underestimates rainfall over most parts of India. Even though TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP-MVK rainfall data sets show similar diurnal variations over the Indian monsoon region, TMPA-3B42RT (GSMaP-MVK) shows larger (smaller) magnitude in diurnal cycle as compared to TMPA-3B42V7. Results from different skill metrics suggest that both research and near real-time versions of TMPA products can be used with relatively higher confidence as compared to GSMaP over the Indian region during peak monsoon period.\n",

Owing to the good results in interpolating precipitation anomalies (and to the fewer steps required for producing the maps), the Multiquadratic method was chosen to construct the 6-h precipitation ratios maps for the period 1975\u20132010. By comparing the new gridded data set to similar sets of data, and by using precipitation data from five independent stations, it was proven that the proposed methodology was suitable for accurately estimating in space and time the 6-h precipitation values. The final outcome of this work is a gridded precipitation data set, at a 6-h time step, available in high spatial resolution (1 km \u00d7 1 km) together with the estimated accuracy.\n",

        "description": "\n\nObserved and projected climatic changes demand for robust assessments of climate impacts on various environmental and anthropogenic systems. Empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD) methods coupled to output from climate model projections are promising tools to assess impacts at regional to local scale. ESD methods correct for common model deficiencies in accuracy (e.g. model biases) and scale (e.g. grid vs point scale). However, most ESD methods require long observational time series at the target sites, and this often restricts robust impact assessments to a small number of sites. This paper presents a method to generate robust climate model based  scenarios for target sites with short and (or) sparse observational data coverage. The approach is based on the well-established quantile mapping method and incorporates two major steps: (1) climate model bias correction to the most representative station with long-term measurements and (2) spatial transfer of bias-corrected model data to represent target site characteristics. Both steps are carried out using the quantile mapping technique. The resulting output can serve as end user\u2013tailored input for climate impact models. The method allows for multivariate and multi-model ensemble scenarios and additionally enables to approximately reconstruct data for non-measured periods. The method's applicability is validated using (1) long-term weather stations across the topographically and climatologically complex territory of Switzerland and (2) sparse data sets from Swiss permafrost research sites located in challenging conditions at high altitudes. It is shown that the two-step approach performs well and offers attractive quality, even for extreme target locations. Uncertainties, however, remain and primarily depend on (1) data availability and (2) the considered variable. The two-step approach itself involves large uncertainties when applied to short reference data sets or spatially heterogeneous variables (e.g. precipitation, wind speed). For temperature, results are promising even when using very short calibration periods.\n",

This study aims to address this shortcoming. A preliminary investigation of global climate model (GCM) data and high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) data shows that the latter exhibits greater variability over Ireland by reducing the dominance of the surrounding seas on the climate signal. This motivates the subsequent dynamical downscaling and analysis of the temperature output from three high-resolution (4\u20137 km grid size) RCMs over Ireland. The three RCMs, driven by four GCMs from CMIP3 and CMIP5, were run under different Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and representative concentration pathway (RCP) future scenarios. Projections of mean and extreme temperature changes are considered for the mid-century (2041\u20132060) and assessed relative to the control period of 1981\u20132000.\nAnalysis of the RCM data shows that annual mean temperatures are projected to rise between 0.4 and 1.8 \u00b0C above control levels by mid-century. On a seasonal basis, results differ by forcing scenario. Future summers have the largest projected warming under RCP 8.5, where the greatest warming is seen in the southeast of Ireland. The remaining two high emission scenarios (SRESs A1B and A2) project future winters to have the greatest warming, with almost uniform increases of 1.5\u20132 \u00b0C across the island.\nChanges in the bidecadal 5th and 95th percentile values of daily minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively, are also analysed. The greatest change in daily minimum temperature is projected for future winters (indicating fewer cold nights and frost days), a pattern that is consistent across all scenarios/forcings.\nAn investigation into the distribution of temperature under RCP 8.5 shows a strong summer increase compounded by increased variability, and a winter increase compounded by an increase in skewness.\n",

Results show that GCMs reliably reproduce the geographical distribution of the variables considered. Compared with observations, however, most GCMs have topography-related cold biases (although these are smaller than those found in previous studies), excessive precipitation, an underestimated southeast\u2013northwest precipitation gradient, an overestimated magnitude and spatial variability of the interannual variability of temperature and precipitation, and an inadequate strength of the East Asian monsoon circulation. Pairwise comparison reveals that GCMs continue to improve from the TAR via the AR4 to the AR5 for temperature, but have little change for precipitation and the East Asian monsoon. The ability of GCMs varies with season and is affected to certain degree by their horizontal resolutions. Both the arithmetic mean and the median of multiple GCMs are little affected by filtering GCMs in terms of their ability, and the multi-model mean outperforms most of individual GCMs in every respect.\n",

While the variability and trends in anticyclonic circulation patterns (including blocking) over Greenland have been previously documented, an analysis of the most extreme blocking events within the observational record is lacking. In this study, a historical climatology of extreme Greenland blocking episodes (GBEs) from 1958 to 2013 is examined within the context of anomalous anticyclonic circulation patterns over the North Atlantic region during recent years. Based on a combination of the ERA-40 (1958\u20131978) and ERA-Interim (1979\u20132013) reanalysis data sets, the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) is used to quantify 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies for the identification of extreme GBEs. The annual rate of extreme blocking days has doubled since 1958, reaching an average of approximately 20 days per year by 2013. The frequency and, to some extent, duration of extreme GBEs were unprecedentedly high from 2007 to 2013 compared to the 56-year period of record, with a majority of the increase occurring during the spring (MAM) and summer (JJA). A multiple linear regression analysis reveals that interannual variability in extreme blocking and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) are the two predominant drivers of surface meltwater production across the entire Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), but Arctic sea ice extent and North Atlantic cyclone activity can also influence the extent of summer melting over portions of the GrIS. Thus, in addition to the larger-scale atmospheric and oceanic variability, smaller-scale features such as extratropical cyclones can play a significant role in modulating GrIS surface melting each summer.\n",

Furthermore, a copulas-based method was introduced in this study to identify possible inflection points of the relationship between precipitation and temperature in the WRB. Results indicate that: (1) spatially, both annual average precipitation and temperature decreased from southeast to northwest; temporally, for most months, a decreasing trend was found for precipitation while the air temperature in most months has a significantly increasing trend at 99% confidence level at monthly and annual time scales in the WRB; (2) climate warming has less effect on the precipitation structure than that on the precipitation magnitude in the WRB; and (3) overall, the relationship between precipitation and temperature in the whole WRB has no significant inflection point, implying a relatively stable relationship between precipitation and temperature changes.

The annual average heat flux of the mainland was 0.4\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122, with a sharp difference between the eastern and western regions. Fluxes in the eastern regions were mostly between 0.5 and 20\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122, and they were between 0 and 0.05\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122 in the western regions. In urban or built-up areas of typical cities, the heat fluxes may be much higher than the average for larger areas, typically ranging from 20 to 100\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122.

Long temperature series are a useful tool both as a direct indicator of global climatic trends and as input to climate models. However, ensuring the quality of the data records is challenging, with issues arising from the wide range of sensors used, how the sensors were calibrated, and how the data were recorded and written down. In particular, the very definition of the temperature scales has evolved. While the temperature scales have always been tied to phase transitions of substances such as the freezing and boiling points of water, the temperatures assigned to those phase transitions have been revised occasionally when new sensors and measuring techniques suggested discrepancies between the temperature scales and thermodynamic temperature. Invariably this has led to alterations in the reference scales of temperature that give rise to biases when compiling historic temperature records, an issue that appears to be neglected in the meteorological literature. The present work deals with this issue for 20th century data by proposing a mathematical model to allow the conversion from historical scales to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). This work also presents the implementation of this mathematical model into a software tool, which can convert large files of historical records to the ITS-90. The correction equation is applied to example observations, and it is found that the correction becomes an issue in special cases involving aggregated temperature data. However, the corrections are significantly smaller than the global warming trend seen in the 20th century. The corrections applied have shown a level of change, which has not significantly affected the global warming trend.\n",

It was found that the extreme cold (warm) events are less (more) frequent in January over East Asia following a positive phase of AO-OND, which might be attributed to the intrinsic persistence of AO-OND in stratosphere and the memory of Eurasian snow cover. It is revealed that the barotropic structure of AO-OND could extend to stratosphere. By the following January, wave activities propagate from stratosphere downwards to upper troposphere, then bent equatorwards to mid-latitudes. Consequently, the January circumpolar jet (polar vortex) gets strengthened (colder) because the equatorward-pointing (upwards) wave activities correspond to poleward meridional eddy momentum (eddy heat) flux. In such a way, the anomalous AO-OND persists into the following January. On the other hand, positive phase of AO-OND causes significant surface warming in most parts of Eurasia, leading to Eurasian snow melt. The October\u2013December snow melt has intrinsic climatic memory and further weakens the January Siberian High through reducing surface albedo. Besides, the surface warming in North Europe because of reduced surface albedo caused by snow melt could stimulate a Rossby wave train propagating eastwards across Eurasia, which restrains the blocking events around Ural region. In such a context, the incidence of extreme warm (cold) events over East Asia is more (less) frequent.\n",

Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as \u2018once in a century\u2019, have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river's main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012\u20132015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Ni\u00f1a/El Ni\u00f1o events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.\n",

For this, we used the results of the simulations of four regional climate models (RCMs) of the Regional Climate Change Assessment for the La Plata Basin (CLARIS-LPB) project. The capacity and limitations of the models to simulate seasonal precipitation for the past period is discussed. In general, the RCMs tended to overestimate the observed precipitation during DJF in the NEB and underestimate it during JJA in the LPB. In relation to change in precipitation (future minus past), the RCMs indicated a decrease in precipitation over northern SA. The average fluxes of the AMZ and NEB regions provided most of the water vapour through the east and north edges, which indicates that the contributions of the North and South Atlantic trade winds are equally important for the entry of moisture during JJA and DJF. This configuration was observed in all models and climates. By comparing past and future climates, the moisture flux convergence during the past was lower relative to the future in different regions and seasons, with statistically significant differences at the 5% level considering the Student's t-test. In the same study, we compared the simulated (RCMs) and reanalysis moisture flux (ERA-40) in the past climate. The result indicated that the CLARIS project's RCMs are capable of simulating values similar or equal to the observed ones, providing high quality data for SA that can be useful in the analysis of changes in future moisture fluxes.\n",

While these maps are popular in climate change assessment reports, limited empirical research has tested which combinations of colour (including variation in the visual variables of hue, lightness, and saturation) and pattern (including variation in the visual variables of size, shape, spacing, orientation, and arrangement) are best suited to mapping projected changes coincident with uncertainty. We evaluate eight coincident-bivariate techniques for mapping global temperature (CMIP5 ensemble using RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios) and its uncertainty, each using 20-classes: five temperature change classes combined with four uncertainty classes. Subjects ranked rectangular map regions by overall amounts of temperature change and uncertainty; response accuracy was evaluated using Kendall's Tau Distance. Maps using colour for representing temperature change and pattern for uncertainty appear most suitable for retaining separability of temperature and uncertainty information. Spot symbols for uncertainty (combining arrangement and lightness) overlaid on hue/lightness for temperature performed best for uncertainty ranking, second best for temperature ranking, and were map users' preferred representation. If colour alone must be used for both variables, then a classed overlay of lightness/saturation differences for uncertainty with hue/lightness for temperature change was preferred; such maps were strong performers on the uncertainty-ranking task but interfered with map users' ability to rank temperature change. Such a masking approach may be the best choice if the goal is to actively prevent map users from making erroneous inferences based on highly uncertain model output for climate change.\n",

This article comprehensively presents temporal and spatial changes of these indices for the time period 1961\u20132010. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes consistent with warming, for instance, decreases in cold extremes and increases in warm extremes over China. The warming in the coldest day and night is larger than the warmest day and night, respectively, which is concurrent with the coldest night larger than the coldest day and the warmest night larger than the warmest day. Changes in the number of the cold and warm nights are more remarkable than the cold and warm days. Changes in precipitation extremes are, in general, spatially more complex and exhibit a less widespread spatial coverage than the temperature indices, for instance, the patterns of annual total precipitation amount, average daily precipitation rate, and the proportion of heavy precipitation in total annual precipitation are similar with negative trends in a southwest\u2013northeast belt from Southwest China to Northeast China while positive trends in eastern China and northwestern China. The consistency of changes in climate extremes from the CN05 with other datasets based on the stations and reanalyses is also analysed.\n",

Given recent extreme storminess and projections of enhanced winter cyclone activity for this region, there is much interest in assessing the extent to which the cyclone climate of the region may be changing. We address this by assessing a 142-year (1871\u20132012) record of cyclone frequency, intensity and \u2018storminess\u2019 derived from the 20th Century Reanalysis V2 (20CR) dataset. We also use this long-term record to examine associations between cyclone activity and regional hydroclimate. Our results confirm the importance of cyclone frequency in driving seasonal precipitation totals which we find to be greatest during summer months. Cyclone frequency and storminess are characterized by pronounced interannual and multi-decadal variability which are strongly coupled to atmospheric blocking in the Euro-Atlantic region, but we detect no evidence of an increasing trend. We observe an upward trend in cyclone intensity for the BI region, which is strongest in winter and consistent with model projections, but promote caution interpreting this given the changing data quality in the 20CR over time. Nonetheless, we assert that long-term reconstruction is helpful for contextualizing recent storminess and for identifying emerging changes in regional hydroclimate linked to cyclones.\n",

With relatively few validation studies over the Eastern Himalayan region, this study examined seasonal and interannual skills of four gridded precipitation products including the regional gauge-based APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources) and three near-global satellite-based products: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) MORPHing (CMORPH), and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRP) using in-situ rain gauge data from Bhutan for the period 1998\u20132012. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the dominant rainfall patterns over Bhutan. An attempt has also been made to correct precipitation biases in the satellite-only products using a gamma (\u03b3)-based distribution approach. Results indicated that APHRODITE and satellite-based precipitation products were able to adequately capture the spatio-temporal patterns of rainfall variability over Bhutan. Extreme precipitation events and extreme drought periods were well captured with very good correlations (>0.5). APHRODITE and TRMM 3B43v7 were remarkably similar, whereas satellite-only products (CMORPH and CHIRP) highly underestimated (20\u201360% or 200\u2013450 mm month\u22121) monsoon rainfall over Bhutan. While TRMM 3B43v7 still underestimated monsoon rainfall (by \u223c25%), it has significantly improved the seasonal bias (by 20\u201340%) from its previous version (TRMM 3B43v6). CHIRP performed relatively better in the high rainfall regions but indicated very low correlations over mountainous regions and during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The bias correction approach indicated best results for TRMM 3B43v6 (up to 33%) in the Southern Foothills, whereas satellite-only products improved only moderately (5\u201320%).\n",

Climate data for this analysis were provided by the regional climate model COSMO-CLM, using different grid spacing to ascertain the real importance of using higher resolution climate data, especially over such a complex topography as Italy. Four simulations were carried out at spatial resolutions of 0.125\u00b0 and 0.0715\u00b0, driven by ERA-Interim Reanalysis and the CMCC-CM global model. We investigated the ability of the model to represent realistically the climatology of a subset of climate indicators defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) for precipitation and temperature. Several high-resolution observational data sets available over some Italian regions were therefore used in order to offset the limited number of observations available over Italy in the E-OBS data set and its coarse grid. We found that the increase in resolution could have interesting benefits in representing such extreme indices, especially in the more orographically complex areas. Finally, we investigated future climate changes regarding extreme weather events expected under anthropogenic climate change scenarios, employing the IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentrations, showing that such events are expected to increase over Italy.\n",

Large-scale atmospheric circulation is the principal driver of surface climate and water resource variability over New Zealand. Focusing on the Waitaki River (located in the South Island; one of the most important rivers for hydro-electricity in New Zealand), a comprehensive analysis is presented of the large-scale atmospheric circulation drivers of monthly inflow to the three main headwater lakes, Ohau, Pukaki and Tekapo. Analyses are undertaken using composite, correlation, partial least-squares (PLS) regression and cross-wavelet analyses. Environment-to-climate composite analysis indicates that variation in lake inflow is driven primarily by the strength of the NE\u2013SW pressure gradient over the three lakes (i.e. parallel to the axis of the Southern Alps, from which the lakes are fed). Relatively strong winds from a north-westerly direction are associated with high lake inflow; weaker winds from a more south-westerly direction occur during times of low inflow. Climate-to-environment composites of lake inflow, together with correlation, PLS and wavelet analysis, indicate that inflow is described well by the MZ1 and MZ2 New Zealand-based circulation indices, but not larger-scale modes of atmospheric circulation. The MZ1 and MZ2 indices have rarely been considered previously as explanatory variables for water resources in the South Island of New Zealand, but here it is suggested that these indices represent a promising new direction for future studies, particularly relating to season-ahead prediction of water resource availability.\n",

To this aim, gridded datasets should be comparable to the output of these models and, thus, should represent grid-cell area-averaged values and, whenever possible, they should be defined on the same spatial domains as the models, in order to avoid re-gridding or re-projection. In this study, we present an update of the Spain02 gridded observational dataset for daily precipitation and mean temperature building on the grids defined for the EURO-CORDEX initiative. In order to assess and intercompare different interpolation approaches, we analysed (1) two standard methodologies (ordinary kriging and thin plate splines), (2) three horizontal resolutions: 0.11\u00b0, 0.22\u00b0 and 0.44\u00b0 (matching the rotated EURO-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES grids), (3) two different approaches to guarantee either area-averaged or point representativity of the resulting grid values and (4) including/excluding orography as a covariable in the interpolation procedure.

The K\u00f6ppen CCS (KGT) is considered useful mainly in macroscale and Thornthwaite CCS (TH), with a more complex symbology, in mesoscale for climatic determinations. Camargo (1991) (CAM) proposed a new CCS trying to be as simple as K\u00f6ppen and robust as TH nevertheless with a simple symbology. In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, it is known that regions with distinct availability of seasonal and annual rainfall are classified similarly by KGT, bringing erroneous information to the agricultural credit system, sowing times and yield forecasts. A comparison of different CCS raises a better understanding of a regional climate in different spatial scales and of CCS themselves. Aiming to characterize the climate and the performance of the CAM the KGT, CAM and TH were applied in 334 locations in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The most common CAM climates in the state were subtropical humid with dry winter (ST-UMi) in the Centre and East region of the state, Tropical humid with dry winter (TR-UMi) and Tropical subhumid with dry winter (TR-SBi) in the north and west region, respectively. The total numbers of climates were 7, 19 and 26 from KGT, CAM and TH, respectively. The KGT had the ability in separating climates in macroscale, and CAM and TH in mesoscale. There was a tendency of the three CCS in separating warm and dry from cold and wet regions. The TH and CAM had the same performance (number of climates, NOC) in the extremes regions, in the hotter and dry (northern plateau) and the colder (mountainous regions, altitude\u2009>\u2009900\u2009m) corresponding to 52% of the state (178 locations).

The main characteristics of the Koshava wind are its high wind speed, southeasterly direction, persistence, and gustiness. This paper analyses the synoptic [Mediterranean cyclones (MCs) and Eurasian anticyclones (EAs)] as well as the mesoscale contributors to the Koshava wind. Time and spatial features of the pressure systems have been analysed using an automatic cyclone tracking scheme. The results show that the MCs and EAs that generate Koshava are approximately 1000\u2009km away from the Koshava region. It is demonstrated that the strong anticyclones are the main trigger for the Koshava wind. Less than 3% of the Koshava winds occurred without the occurrence of either an anticyclone or a cyclone. The Synoptic Koshava Index (SKI), developed in this study and defined as the difference between the area-averaged mean sea level pressures in the anticyclone and cyclone regions, has been shown to be a good indicator of the Koshava occurrence. Koshava has also been investigated from the perspective of the gap flow windstorm. The across-mountain pressure difference, \u0394P, is the most important mesoscale contributor to the Koshava characteristics. The across-mountain potential temperature difference, \u0394\u03b8, together with \u0394P, can be successfully used to predict Koshava's occurrence. A simple (linear) probabilistic model for forecasting the Koshava mean hourly wind speed has been constructed. The results demonstrate that the occurrence of the Koshava wind can be predicted with the significantly higher accuracy than the Koshava mean hourly speed. The correlation between Koshava and winds at higher levels is small.\n",

The TS teleconnection has an approximate opposite phase to that in the upper-troposphere Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO), and the TS teleconnection index (the TS index) is also related well to the APO index. Corresponding to a higher TS index, the ozone generally decreases in the NH mid-high latitudes (near 40\u00b0N and the Far East of Russia). This link between the TS teleconnection and the ozone is physically supported by the changes of the background atmospheric circulation. When the TS index is higher, the decrease of the ozone is closely associated with an increase of the local tropopause height. The upward and downward motion variations in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere in the east and west parts of the anomalous anticyclones associated with the TS index strengthen the exchanges of the ozone between the troposphere and the lower stratosphere, which may cause a decrease of the ozone. The horizontal advection of the ozone could also contribute to the ozone decreases over these regions.\n",

Research into desertification and climate change has the potential to contribute to natural resources management and adaptation to climatic and other changes in Earth systems. An Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC), the McGill Paleoclimate Model-2 (MPM-2) was used to explore the climatic biogeophysical effects of desertification in different latitude bands from 1700 to 2000 AD. It was found that latitudinal-band desertification attributable to forest and grass removal caused global cooling, land surface albedo increasing and precipitation reduction in the Northern Hemisphere as well as heat transport increasing in global ocean. These results highlighted global climate reaction to local desertification and demonstrated that the location of the desertification projected a potentially differential impact on local and global climate. That was, desertification in 0\u00b0\u201315\u00b0N gave a somewhat minor effect on global and local climate; desertification in 45\u00b0\u201360\u00b0N caused a significant reduction in global temperature while desertification in 15\u00b0\u201330\u00b0N induced a prominent reduction in local temperature. In response to desertification, surface albedo change as a forcing was the dominant biogeophysical driver of climate over the Northern Hemisphere while precipitation change as a response was probably the primary driver of climate over the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, the regional desertification may cause a global climatic effect, especially concerning desert expansion along the 15\u00b0\u201330\u00b0N and 45\u00b0\u201360\u00b0N latitude bands, which led to a more prominent effect on the Earth's climate and even oceanic circulation. The results of this study provide useful information when comparing the effects of desertification in different latitude bands on climate.\n",

Analyses focus on the period beginning with regular satellite monitoring of TCs (1969/1970) through the year 2012/2013 and consider daily and multi-daily annual maximum rainfall series. Our results indicate that TCs play a prominent role in extreme rainfall over much Australia, with more than half of the highest annual rainfall events associated with these storms over the coastal regions and in particular over Western Australia. Moreover, the TC fractional contribution to extreme rainfall increases as we focus on the largest rainfall events, with approximately 66\u2013100% of annual maxima in excess of 100\u2009mm (\u223c4\u2009inches) over Western Australia associated with TCs at over one third of the locations. Given the well-established controls on Australian TC activity by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we also examined the relationship between extreme rainfall associated with TCs and ENSO using logistic regression. A larger probability of having an annual rainfall maximum related to TCs occurs during La Ni\u00f1a years, consistent with enhanced Australian cyclogenesis during these phases of ENSO. We also highlighted regional differences in the link between ENSO and extreme rainfall events, highlighting the stronger connection along the coastal areas and in particular over Western Australia.\n",

The warming has already emerged from the background climate variability.

Further warming is projected to occur in the same models under all three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) considered (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), with the magnitude far exceeding the warming to date under the two scenarios with higher emissions (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).\n",

        "description": "\n\nMount Kenya is an equatorial mountain whose climatic setting is fairly simple (two rainy seasons in March\u2013May, the Long Rains, and October\u2013December, the Short Rains) though concealing significant spatial variations related to elevation and aspect (part I, Camberlin et al., 2014). This part II is dedicated to the sensitivity of sorghum yields to climate variability in space and time, with a focus on the intra-seasonal characteristics of the rainy seasons. To that aim we use the crop model SARRA-H calibrated for the region and fed with rainfall, temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation data over the period 1973\u20132001 at three stations located on the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya. The crop model is run independently for the two rainy seasons. Four groups of simulations are conducted by varying the initialization date of the simulation, the sowing dates and the type of soil, in order to test sorghum sensitivity to water availability. Evidence is found that potential sorghum yields are dominantly controlled by variations in seasonal rainfall amounts: mean yields are higher at higher and wetter locations, and are higher during the wettest rainy season and years. However, beyond this apparent simplicity, more complex aspects emerge of the crop\u2013climate relationships. First, the yield\u2013elevation relationship is altered at high elevation due to lower temperature. Second, despite a strong link with the seasonal rainfall amounts, we evidence an underlying role of some intra-seasonal rainfall characteristics such as the number of rainy days (itself mainly determined by the rainy season duration) or the occurrence of long dry spells. Third, unseasonal rains occurring after the end of the rainy season, especially after the Short Rains, play a role in final crop yield. Fourth, variations of climate variables such as solar radiation by modulating the potential evapotranspiration concur to yield variations at the wettest locations.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe spatial structure and temporal evolution of the intraseasonal variability (ISV) of the subsurface ocean temperature (STA) in the equatorial Pacific associated with the two flavours of El Ni\u00f1o [i.e. the canonical or eastern Pacific (EP) El Ni\u00f1o and the central Pacific (CP) El Ni\u00f1o] are investigated using observations and 1.5-layer linear reduced gravity model. Results suggest that the ISV characteristics show some differences in the two types of El Ni\u00f1o, although both oscillate along the thermocline in the form of the intraseasonal equatorial Kelvin wave (IEKW), which is excited in the western tropical Pacific by the zonal wind stress associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO). First, the period of dominant mode of the STA ISV during CP El Ni\u00f1o broadly distributes in 50\u201380 days with the spectra peaking in 60\u201365 days. By contrast, the spectrum of STA ISV during EP El Ni\u00f1o shows a peak in 75\u201380-day period. This indicates that the wave speed is faster in the CP El Ni\u00f1o than in EP El Ni\u00f1o. Second, the ISV activity peaks in previous spring during the developing phase of EP El Ni\u00f1o, whereas during CP El Ni\u00f1o it becomes the most active during the mature phase. Third, the strongest IEKW occurs in the CP around the dateline during CP El Ni\u00f1o and attenuates quickly east of 130\u00b0W due to strong eddy viscosity dissipation, while the IEKW during the EP El Ni\u00f1o propagates efficiently from the western to the eastern Pacific with a relative weak diffusion.\n",

        "description": "\n\nClimate variability modulates spatio-temporal variability of dry spells (DSs) and wet spells (WSs) within a river basin and will affect water resources management practices leading to various impacts on the socio-economic development in river basins. In this study, we evaluated spatio-temporal variability of DS and WS in Huai River basin (HRB), China, by developing copula-based severity-duration-frequency (SDF) curves. The result shows that the upper reach and the southern part of middle reach of HRB are prone to both DS and WS; however, the duration and severity of WS are comparatively higher in comparison to DS. It was observed that DS is more frequent in spring and summer, whereas WS in summer and autumn. The choice of copula plays an important role in deriving the SDF curves, and an inappropriately chosen copula function may result in a large bias of SDF estimation. The arch12 copula was found to be the best choice in the majority of stations for deriving the SDF curves. The constructed SDF curves primarily shows two major patterns for DS and WS, i.e. concave down pattern and convex up pattern. The frequency of extreme DS decreases from 1960s to 1990s, and increases after 2000s, while the frequency of extreme WS increases from 1970s to 1990s and then decreases from 1990s to 2000s. The results in this study can provide useful information for designing conservation structures and to develop water allocation strategies at different temporal scales.\n",

The relevant areas are characterized by complex terrain and coastlines, and exhibit large spatial variability in seasonal precipitation. Global seasonal forecasts provide only partial information of the precipitation as a result of their coarse spatial resolution. We present two statistical downscaling methods of global forecasts, both identifying past-analogue synoptic-weather patterns and their connection to precipitation at specific stations. The first method utilizes a classification of the large-scale weather patterns into regimes, and the other identifies the closest past analogues directly without grouping the weather events. The validation of the algorithms using NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and past precipitation observations at 18 stations shows that both methods provide good skill in predicting mean precipitation amounts and quantiles of the precipitation distribution, and in reproducing the observed inter-annual and spatial variability. Both methods show good correlations between predicted and observed precipitation amounts (\u223c0.8), and the downscaled precipitation reproduces the observed differences between the stations, which are not available in the coarse global models. Based on these results, we downscaled the operational global-seasonal forecasts issued by the NCEP CFS1.0 ensemble. This approach could also have utility in climate change scenario downscaling.\n",

The time series of the ENSO-like pattern significantly correlates with the EAWM index for the period 1949\u20132004 based on the HadISST SST data set and the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. Their correlation coefficient is \u22120.32 at the 95% confidence level. The warm (cold) phase of ENSO-like SSTAs is associated with a weakened (strengthened) Siberian High and an eastern-positioned (western-positioned) Aleutian Low, anomalous southerly (northerly) wind at 850 hPa and positive (negative) surface air temperature anomalies over East Asia and western North Pacific, while 300 hPa zonal wind anomalies emerge with a reduced (accelerated) East Asian jet stream.\nFurther model examination reveals that the simulated response over East Asia forced by warm (cold) ENSO-like SSTAs in CCM3 and the three-model ensemble corresponds to the weakened (strengthened) EAWM. The spatial correlation coefficients between the three-model ensemble and observation in the atmospheric circulation and surface air temperature range from 0.15 to 0.80 at the 99% confidence level. This success in simulating relationship between ENSO-like SSTAs and EWAM using three-model ensemble proposes a new idea for the EAWM prediction.\n",

An assessment of the biases in the representation of the precipitation annual cycle was performed over the 1979\u20132008 period over five regions within SSA, based on a comparison between the GCMs precipitation outputs with the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) dataset. The multi-model ensemble well reproduces the shape of the annual cycle of precipitation over most of SSA, although the monthly totals were overestimated (underestimated) over the North-West and South (North-East and Central-East) regions. Changes in precipitation and meteorological drought characteristics were identified by the difference for early (2011\u20132040) and late (2071\u20132100) 21st century values with respect to the 1979\u20132008 baseline, using the standardized precipitation index as a short- and long-term drought indicator. Future climate conditions are expected to modify the regional characteristics of meteorological droughts over SSA, but the range of uncertainty in the expected changes is high. A significant increase in the number of drought events in all the regions for most of the 21st century sub-periods is projected for the multi-model ensemble. The mean duration of drought events will be shorter, with no significant changes in the severity of droughts and the occurrence of multi-decadal changes in the number of critical dry months is likely, although the significance in the changes depends on the region, future time horizon and greenhouse gas concentration pathways. These results overlap with a projected increase in precipitation over most of the regions, which has a strong seasonality and, therefore, will have some implications upon the future meteorological drought developments and the agricultural and hydrological practices in SSA.\n",

The meteorology that day, although extreme, was typical of southeast Australian bushfire events, characterized by gusty northerly winds before a cool change brought strong southerly winds and a dramatic temperature drop. This study investigates a range of extra-tropical atmospheric (pressure, temperatures) and oceanic temperature anomalies that occurred on or leading up to BS. Results show several parameters were within the top 5% or were record breaking for the satellite era. Of particular note are the anomalies that occurred over the Antarctic region, having the strongest signal and appearing in unison with the pre-BS heatwave. We suggest that a combination of a warm polar ocean and an enhanced mid-latitude thermal contrast in the Indian Ocean aided in triggering sub-polar blocking and an intense cyclone, which brought the catastrophic cold front on BS.\n",

All RCMs (RCA3.5, HadGEM3-RA, REMO, and RegCM4) were forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Model precipitation was compared against several observational gridded data sets at different time scales. Most RCMs capture well the annual cycle of precipitation and outperform ERA-Interim, which is drier than the observations. RCMs underestimate (overestimate) the precipitation over the coastal plains (mountains) and have some problems to reproduce the interannual variability of the monsoon. To further investigate this, two extreme summers that showed the largest consistency among observations and RCMs were chosen: one wet (1990) and one dry (2005). The impact of the passage of tropical cyclones, the size of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position, and the initial intensity of the land\u2013sea thermal contrast (LSTC) were analysed. During the wet year, the LSTC was stronger than the 2005 dry monsoon season and there were a larger number of hurricanes near the Gulf of California, the WHWP was more extended, and the ITCZ was located in a more northerly position than in 2005. All these processes contributed to a wetter NAM season. During the dry year, the LSTC was weaker, with a later onset, probably due to a previous very wet winter. The inverse precipitation relationship between winter and summer in the monsoon region was well captured by most of the RCMs. RegCM4 showed the largest biases and HadGEM3-RA the smallest ones.\n",

We evaluate a mesoscale atmospheric model, TAPM, as an alternative means of generating spatially explicit topoclimatic data applicable to small scale (200-m resolution) bioclimatic research. Temporal and spatial assessments of TAPM were carried out across New Zealand's mountains. First, goodness-of-fit analyses of TAPM-simulated meteorology against three weather station observations for January and July, 2001\u20132007, were carried out. Second, TAPM-simulated January/July mean daily temperature extremes and wind speeds were compared against interpolated climate grid data for approximately 37 000 grid cells across New Zealand. Third, deviations of TAPM-simulated data from the gridded climate dataset baseline were modelled against GIS-derived landscape position in order to quantify the nature and extent of topoclimatic effects. Temporal assessments indicated that TAPM provided reasonably accurate simulations for hourly temperatures and wind speeds, moderately good estimates for solar radiation and poor estimates for humidity. On the whole, the greatest simulation errors occurred for daily extreme values. Relative to the climate grid baseline, TAPM-simulated temperatures and wind speeds were also relatively unbiased. However, TAPM-simulated values varied widely around climate grid values, and these deviations were significantly related to landscape position. The relative congruence of simulation biases across time and space suggests that uncertainties are systematic and inherent to the model architecture rather than due to location-related variability. While results suggest caution in using TAPM to simulate daily extremes, biases may be less problematic for studies where relative differences in topoclimate across locations are of interest. Topoclimatic effects appear pervasive across New Zealand's mountain systems and are predictable as a function of topography. On the basis of our results, further investigations into the use of mesoscale atmospheric models to generate topoclimate data in support of research in mountainous areas are merited.\n",

It is important to infer to what extent these regional changes could be attributed to human-induced processes and to what extent to natural variability. Standard methods such as linear trend estimates or piecewise linear trends can be inadequate because they may result in erratic, non-systematic results, particularly if different scales of variability are present in each record and various records are to be compared. The Orcadas Antarctic Station (Argentina), with daily surface meteorological observations since April 1903, provides Antarctica's longest observational record. This study analyses the Orcadas seasonal surface temperature variability. Multidecadal variability and short-term trends are studied to provide an improved assessment of climate evolution and necessary information for the determination of mechanisms driving regional/local change. A combined method using wavelet transform (WT), non-linear statistical model approaches and derivative of fits is developed. This methodology is also applied for validation and comparison to the Gomez ice core oxygen isotope record for the 1857\u20132006 and 1903\u20132006 time intervals. Significant quasi 50-year and quasi 20-year variability bands were obtained, both for the quarterly and seasonal Orcadas temperature records, with warming (cooling) periods detected between 1903\u20131912, 1927\u20131961 and 1972\u20132004 (1912\u20131927 and 1962\u20131972). If seasons are considered, the only one with a fairly sustained warming is summer, where actual cooling is observed only at the beginning, prior to the early 1930s. Quasi 50-year variability was also detected in the Gomez record. Long periods are obtained in the model fits, longer than the time series, which varied with window length. Although not representing variability cycles, they could represent the best fit of the non-linear, non oscillating asymptotic stationary component of the series, i.e. a non-linear trend.\n",

The SPEI data were converted into drought duration, magnitude and types of occurrence to capture overall drought scenario. A non-parametric (Mann\u2013Kendall test) method was used to test for monotonic trend at each grid level, whereas the magnitude was estimated using Sen's method. Further, a field significance test was performed at major meteorological regions level to assess whether the individual trends identified could occur by chance in an analysis of large number of time series analysed. Significant (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) increasing trend of both drought duration and magnitude during the monsoon was found over parts of eastern, central and north-eastern region of India, whereas the parts of west coast, arid western region and north India showed significantly decreasing trend. The trends in mid- as well as late-season drought were contributing towards significant increase in drought condition, whereas trends in early-season drought were responsible for decrease in drought events. The time series analysis of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) illustrated that over eastern part of India the increase in drought was attributed due to decrease in rainfall, whereas the decrease in drought occurrence over western arid region was mainly because of decrease in PET.\n",

The regional ensemble seasonal hindcasts were conducted at a resolution of 25\u2009km by driving RegCM4 with the corresponding ensembles of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal hindcasts. Skill and cost/loss ratio analysis were carried out on the probabilistic hindcasts to assess how much added value a regional model would bring over the driving ECMWF forecasts. RegCM4 shows an added value over most areas of southeastern Africa where the skill of the global circulation model (GCM) is already positive. In terms of economic benefits, RegCM4 brings additional benefits for southeastern Africa either by benefiting more users with interest in larger cost/loss ratio or by providing a higher economic value for users with small cost/loss ratio. Additional RegCM4 simulations with the same resolution were performed using a near \u2018perfect\u2019 boundary conditions with \u2018continuous (climate)\u2019 and \u2018reinitialized\u2019 modes to test the impact of land surface initialization/ spin up time on the seasonal mean precipitation simulation. Evaluation of the \u2018perfect\u2019 boundary forced simulations reveals that the regional model not only generates finer spatial-scale features that are missing in the ECMWF GCM, in terms of the December to April (DJFMA) climatology, but also reduced the wet bias of the driving GCM. Land surface initialization is found to have less impact on the DJFMA seasonal mean rainfall for forecasts initialized on 1 November, suggesting that 1 month is enough to recover from the shock of poor soil moisture initialization.\n",

The identification and assessment of remote interactions (teleconnections) are carried out by using ground station and gridded data sets. Monthly rainfall data from six ground stations over the UAE for the period of 1982\u20132010 is used in this study along with the long-term gridded precipitation and temperature data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center and Global Historic Climatic Network. Linear correlations, wavelet analysis, and cross-wavelet analysis have been applied to identify the relation between climate indices and precipitation (temperature). The analysis reveals that the strong variability in precipitation is closely associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Indian Ocean Dipole Index (IOD) during the months of August\u2013March, September\u2013January, respectively. In case of temperature, the strong variability is associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) and the East Atlantic Oscillation Index (EAO) during the months of April\u2013October, July\u2013December. Spatial analysis of cross-wavelet reveals that the winter precipitation is significantly influenced by SOI and temperature during summer by the NAO. This research concludes that the negative phases of SOI (NAO) play a significant role in the increase of precipitation (decrease in summer temperatures) over the UAE region.\n",

Significant interdecadal changes in different characteristics of the temperature extremes are revealed. It is shown that summertime warming detected in the Moscow region in recent decades is not solely due to an increase in the number of hot days, but also due to a decrease in the number of cold days. Statistically significant positive (negative) trends in the number of anomalously hot (cold) days since the mid 1970s are detected. Respective trend values are 5%/decade\u20131 for the positive trends and \u22126%/decade\u20131 for the negative trends. We find that in 1981\u20132012 the number of summer seasons with extremely hot days has doubled with respect to earlier period (1949\u20131980). However, we do not find statistically significant trend-like changes in the duration of the hot events in Moscow. A chronology of temperature extremes in Moscow has been constructed.

        "description": "\n\nA statistical-dynamical downscaling method is used to estimate future changes of wind energy output (Eout) of a benchmark wind turbine across Europe at the regional scale. With this aim, 22 global climate models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble are considered. The downscaling method uses circulation weather types and regional climate modelling with the COSMO-CLM model. Future projections are computed for two time periods (2021\u20132060 and 2061\u20132100) following two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The CMIP5 ensemble mean response reveals a more likely than not increase of mean annual Eout over Northern and Central Europe and a likely decrease over Southern Europe. There is some uncertainty with respect to the magnitude and the sign of the changes. Higher robustness in future changes is observed for specific seasons. Except from the Mediterranean area, an ensemble mean increase of Eout is simulated for winter and a decreasing for the summer season, resulting in a strong increase of the intra-annual variability for most of Europe. The latter is, in particular, probable during the second half of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In general, signals are stronger for 2061\u20132100 compared to 2021\u20132060 and for RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Regarding changes of the inter-annual variability of Eout for Central Europe, the future projections strongly vary between individual models and also between future periods and scenarios within single models. This study showed for an ensemble of 22 CMIP5 models that changes in the wind energy potentials over Europe may take place in future decades. However, due to the uncertainties detected in this research, further investigations with multi-model ensembles are needed to provide a better quantification and understanding of the future changes.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis study evaluates the capability of regional climate models (RCMs) in simulating extreme rainfall events over Southern Africa, and in reproducing the characteristics of widespread extreme rainfall events (WERE) in the Western Cape (South Africa). We obtained simulation datasets of nine RCMs from the Co-ordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) and compared them with observation datasets from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) as well as with the reanalysis dataset (ERAINT) that forced the simulations. A self-organising map was used to classify the WEREs into 12 nodes. The contribution of each RCM to each node was compared with the contributions of GPCP, TRMM and ERAINT. Using ERAINT dataset, we analysed the synoptic-scale atmospheric condition associated with each node.\nThe results show that, in simulating the spatial distribution of the extreme rainfall event over Southern Africa, only four RCMs perform better than the forcing reanalysis (ERAINT) while two RCMs perform worse than the reanalysis. All the RCMs underestimate the threshold of extreme rainfall over Western Cape, poorly simulate the inter-annual variability of the WEREs (r \u2264 0.3), but correctly reproduce the maximum frequency of the WEREs in Autumn (March\u2013May). The WEREs in the Western Cape may be broadly grouped into four synoptic rainfall patterns. The first pattern links WEREs with tropical rainfall activities (tropical-temperate troughs); the second pattern shows isolated WEREs; the third and fourth patterns link WEREs with rainfall activities in the mid-latitudes (frontal systems) and over the Agulhas Current, respectively. While most RCMs overestimate the frequency of the first pattern, they all underestimate the frequency of the second pattern but simulate the frequencies of the third and fourth patterns well. The results of this study should help in improving the RCM simulations over Southern Africa and in downscaling impacts of climate change on extreme rainfall events over the region.\n",

This region has a unique and sensitive climate due to its complex topography and atmospheric circulation, thus making it challenging in climate simulations. This article focuses on the representation of five teleconnections in and around the Mediterranean region and how they affect one another and the region.\nThe Regional Climate Model, RegCM4, has been used to simulate the climate from 1969 to 1999 for a domain covering the Mediterranean and the surrounding region. A generalized method for calculating the indices for these patterns was identified and the corresponding indices were constructed from the modelled data and compared with reanalysis data. The modelled data was found to be highly correlated with the 20th Century Reanalysis data and the probability density functions (PDFs) were very similar to the reanalysis data, showing that the teleconnections were successfully represented within the model.\nMaps of the influence of these teleconnections on temperature, precipitation and wind were also comparable to the reanalysis data, thereby suggesting that model data can be used for future projections of teleconnections and their effects on these parameters. With the use of this high-resolution data, inter-pattern relationships suggested in previous studies (such as that between the Mediterranean Oscillation and North sea-Caspian Pattern) became more evident. This article also shows how the influence of teleconnections on winds affects the circulation and hence the temperature and precipitation of the region.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Mediterranean coast of Spain often experiences intense rainfall, sometimes reaching remarkable amounts of more than 400 mm in one day. The aim of this work is to study possible changes of extreme precipitation in Spain for this century, simulated from several Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models. Eighteen climate projections (nine models under RCP4.5 and nine RCP8.5 scenarios) were downscaled using a two-step analogue/regression statistical method. We have selected 144 rain gauges as the rainiest of a network by using a threshold of 250 mm in one day for a return period of 100 years. Observed time-series have been extended using the ERA40 reanalysis and have subsequently been used to correct the climate projections according to a parametric quantile\u2013quantile method. Five theoretical distributions (Gamma, Weibull, Classical Gumbel, Reversed Gumbel and Log-logistic) have been used to fit the empirical cumulative functions (entire curves, not only the upper tail) and to estimate the expected precipitation according to several return periods: 10, 20, 50 and 100 years. Results in the projected changes for 2051\u20132100 compared to 1951\u20132000 are similar (in terms of sign and value) for the four return periods. The analysed climate projections show that changes in extreme rainfall patterns will be generally less than the natural variability. However, possible changes are detected in some regions: decreases are expected in a few kilometres inland, but with a possible increase in the coastline of southern Valencia and northern Alicante, where the most extreme rainfall was recorded. These results should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of climate projections; anyway, this work shows that the developed methodology is useful for studying extreme rainfall under several climate scenarios.\n",

In the analysed multi-year period and study area, 11 HWs were observed in the north and 51 HWs were observed in the south. The occurrence of HWs was mainly connected with positive anomalies of sea level pressure and with the 500 hPa level, which shows the presence of high-pressure systems.

In South Africa, substantial climate-related impacts are predicted, and protected area management agencies will need to respond actively to impacts. It is critical for management agencies to understand the way in which climate is changing locally to predict impacts and respond appropriately. Here, for the first time, we quantify observable changes in temperature and rainfall in South African national parks over the past five to ten decades. Our results show significant increases in temperatures in most parks, with increases being most rapid in the arid regions of the country. Increases in the frequency of extreme high temperature events were also most pronounced in these regions. These results are consistent with other climate studies conducted in these areas. Similar increases were identified for both minimum and maximum temperatures, though absolute minimum temperatures increased at greater rates than absolute maxima. Overall, rainfall trends were less obvious, but a decrease in rainfall was observed for the southern Cape (in three parks), and an increase was detected in one park. The observed temperature changes over the last 20\u201350 years have in several instances already reached those predicted for near future scenarios (2035), indicating that change scenarios are conservative. These results provide individual parks with evidence-based direction for managing impacts under current and projected changes in local climate. They also provide the management agency with sub-regional information to tailor policy and impact monitoring. Importantly, our results highlight the critical role that individual weather stations play in informing local land management and the concerns for parks that have no local information on changes in climate.\n",

Four warm periods (AD 650\u2013750, AD 1000\u20131100, AD 1190\u20131290, and AD 1900\u20132000) and five cold periods (AD 440\u2013540, AD 780\u2013920, AD 1390\u20131460, AD 1600\u20131700, and AD 1800\u20131900) were selected on a centennial timescale, referring to the synthesized temperature changes over China and Northern Hemisphere. The regional differences in precipitation were analysed and compared using a data set consisting of the grades in severity of floods and droughts as derived from Chinese historical documents. The results showed that there has been no fixed spatial pattern of precipitation anomalies during either cold or warm periods in eastern China over the past 2000 years. For the most of warm periods, there existed coherence of spatial pattern with dry condition only occurred over north of the Yangtze River, and the consistent spatial patterns were found between the periods 650\u2013750 and 1190\u20131290, 650\u2013750, and 1000\u20131100. For the cold periods, the precipitation showed various spatial patterns, and similarities were only presented in the two periods of 1600\u20131700 and 1800\u20131900 featured by meridional distribution. Comparing the spatial patterns between cold and warm periods, inverse pattern of 440\u2013540 and 1900\u20132000 over the most study area can be detected, but similar pattern was also found between the periods 1800\u20131900 and 1900\u20132000, and 1600\u20131700 and 1900\u20132000. Our results implicated that the relationship between temperature and spatial pattern of precipitation anomaly has high complexity, which would be of significance to understanding the spatial pattern of precipitation in the future climate change study.\n",

The effects of urban climate on human health are one of the motivations for the development of various urban climate analysis tools. Climate Analysis Seoul (CAS) is a tool that incorporates a meso-scale atmospheric model and conceptual geographic information system (GIS)-based models to provide gridded air temperature deviations based on high-resolution land cover information. The CAS output was evaluated using air temperatures observed at 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) located in the detail region (DR) Eunpyeong. Correlation analyses were performed to reveal the influence of different land cover characteristics and CAS output variables on measured air temperature deviations. Based on the results of the correlation analyses in the study region (SR) Seoul, a regression model (total air temperature distribution, TD\u2032) was developed. It predicts spatially distributed air temperatures based on morphological parameters and an observed reference temperature. Using the TD\u2032 model, maps of daily maximum air temperatures were produced for the entire area of Seoul with a horizontal resolution of 25\u2009m, and of 5\u2009m for the DR, the latter allows to assess the impacts of different building and vegetation structures on air temperature by resolving buildings. The TD\u2032 model was evaluated using measurements at eight AWS. The TD\u2032 model slightly overestimated daily maximum air temperatures in 2007 and 2011, but performed better for 2011, mainly because land cover data represent the final state of the urban development. The TD\u2032 model appears to be a suitable tool for estimating air temperature distributions at building-resolving resolutions. It can be used to assess changes in the thermal environment and heat-related hazards through urban development plans already ahead of their realization.\n",

This study investigates how Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models represent different types of ENSO and how they represent teleconnections to South American precipitation. It is found that the CMIP5 models can represent the basic structure of SST anomalies that occur during different types of ENSO events and these are described using simple SST indices. Most of the CMIP5 models can reproduce the correct sign of precipitation anomalies in northeast South America during austral summer and autumn, in cases where the observed teleconnections are relatively strong. The same is also true of north South America in austral summer. In the east and southeast regions of South America, many models fail to reproduce the correct sign during both Canonical and Modoki/Central Pacific/Warm Pool ENSO events. The precipitation composites in Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) models tend to agree with their CMIP5 counterparts, so we conclude that the errors in teleconnections are not principally driven by mean SST biases. Precipitation teleconnections in the northern regions are shown to be linked to variations in the Walker circulation in models, with the exception of that in north South America during March\u2013May. During March\u2013May, composite precipitation in southeast South America is related to wave trains emanating from the equator.\n",

Early and late monsoon onsets are related to the temperature anomalies in different regions. It is found that an early onset follows negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central tropical Pacific (CP) Ocean during the preceding winter and spring, corresponding to a CP La Ni\u00f1a. In contrast, a late onset is preceded by the negative surface air temperature anomalies over land in the central Asian continent. Negative SST anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the associated warming in the western Pacific induce an anomalously enhanced Walker circulation. This anomalous Walker cell leads to an increase in convection, causing more latent heat release and a subsequent decrease of surface pressure. The anomalous Walker cell and the enhanced latent heat release weaken the Western North Pacific subtropical high and the Philippine Sea anticyclone, favouring a westerly flow from the Indian Ocean, resulting in an early SCSSM onset. On the other hand, negative land surface temperature anomalies cool the atmosphere over land, and locally modify the Hadley circulation, accompanied by the anomalous divergence in the low-level atmosphere over the western equatorial Pacific. This divergence anomaly reduces the latent heat release and strengthens the anticyclone in the Philippine Sea, thus preventing the westward extension of the westerlies from the Indian Ocean and causing a late SCSSM onset.\n",

An effective method for assessing climate change and for providing information to decision makers and stakeholders is needed to implement appropriate adaptation strategies. The objective of this study was to determine whether climate change has caused spatio-temporal changes in meteorological elements in North Korea. We delineated the spatio-temporal patterns of temperature and precipitation caused by climate change in specific time periods based on statistically significant differences using a statistically robust method. Historical weather data from 27 meteorological stations over a 30-year period (1981\u20132010) were used. The results demonstrated that statistically significant changes occurred over the 30 years. The temporal trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures were highly significantly different in the western agricultural regions and central/southwest urban regions during 1996\u20132010 compared with 1981\u20131995. The precipitation amounts were significantly different in the southeast regions (around the coast). The numbers of precipitation events were significantly different for portions of the northern and northeast areas near the mountains. Additionally, statistically significant differences in the spatial structures of the temperature and precipitation were found at different time scales. The significant differences were not uniform in each season/month. Therefore, significant differences occurred in the meteorological elements, and particular locations and urbanized areas were affected by global warming. However, the temporal trends and spatial structures of each meteorological element were not equally modified; the meteorological changes occurred locally as a result of the changing climate.\n",

Although a slight slope-related diverging katabatic flow component is detectable, the area is an essentially flat (\u223c10\u2009m elevation change or less) homogeneous snow surface. The European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts meteorological analyses data reproduce a significant accumulation gradient and suggest that 90% of the the mean accumulation results from the 25% largest precipitation events. During these events, air masses originate from coastal areas in the north rather than from inland in the south. Radiative cooling condensation occurs on the way across the dome and as the moisture reservoir is depleted less snow is dumped 25\u2009km south than north, with little direct impact from the local (50-km scale) topography. Air masses are warmer on average, and warmer north than south, when originating from the coast. This marginally affects the mean temperature gradients. The moisture gradients are more affected because moisture is nonlinearly related to temperature: the mean atmospheric moisture is larger north than south. Significant meteorological and hydrological gradients over such relatively small distances (50\u2009km) over locally flat region may be an issue when interpreting ice cores: although cores are drilled at the top of domes and ridges where the slopes and elevation gradients are minimal, they sample small surfaces in areas affected by significant meteorological and hydrological spatial gradients.\n",

The analysis covers the years 1998\u20132014 and is carried out using TRMM 3B43 Version 7 rainfall estimates. In both regions, extensive periods of anomalously low rainfall and prolonged drought have prevailed since roughly 2008. Prior to that time, only three periods of drought are noteworthy 1998/1999, 2000, and 2005. The post-2008 drought conditions were interrupted by floods in both regions in February 2010 and in several years in the equatorial region. This rapid alternation between extremes creates additional hardships on the population. Two notable results emerge from this analysis. One is the tendency for similar trends in interannual variability in both regions, despite vastly different rainfall regimes. The other is the persistence of recent droughts through several rainy seasons. The implication of these results is that one or more factors in interannual variability is operative in all seasons. This could account for the common trends in the equatorial and summer rainfall regions.\n",

The objective of this work is to evaluate the utility of relatively high-spatial resolution rainfall products to reproduce observed multi-decadal rainfall characteristics such as climatologies, anomalies and trends over Saudi Arabia. Our study compares the statistical characteristics of rainfall from 53 observatories over the reference period 1965\u20132005, with rainfall data from six widely used gauge-based products, including APHRODITE, GPCC, PRINCETON, UDEL, CRU and PREC/L. In addition, the performance of three global climate models (GCMs), including CCSM4, EC-EARTH and MRI-I-CGCM3, integrated as part of the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), was also evaluated. Results indicate that the gauge-based products were generally skillful in reproducing rainfall characteristics in Saudi Arabia. In most cases, the gauge-based products were also able to capture the annual cycle, anomalies and climatologies of observed data, although significant inter-product variability was observed, depending on the assessment metric being used. In comparison, the GCM-based products generally exhibited poor performance, with larger biases and very weak correlations, particularly during the summertime. Importantly, all products generally failed to reproduce the observed long-term seasonal and annual trends in the region, particularly during the dry seasons (summer and autumn). Overall, this work suggests that selected gauge-based products with daily (APHRODITE and PRINCETON) and monthly (GPCC and CRU) resolutions show superior performance relative to other products, implying that they may be the most appropriate data source from which multi-decadal variations of rainfall can be investigated at the regional scale over Saudi Arabia. Discriminating these skillful products is important not only for reducing uncertainty in climate, hydrological and environmental assessments but also for advancing model developments in the region.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe relationship between atmospheric blocking and extreme precipitation in summer in Romania during the period 1962\u20132010 is investigated. Percentile-based indices (R90p) for extreme precipitation events are calculated using data recorded at a large number of meteorological stations (98) covering the entire country. The dominant mode of variability of these indices has a monopolar structure and is related to two distinct atmospheric circulation blocking patterns. High frequency of blocking in the 0\u00b0\u201340\u00b0E sector is associated with high frequency of extreme precipitation events over Romania. This is due to enhanced synoptic scale activity associated with advection of relatively high potential vorticity from northeast towards Romanian region, as well as with enhanced synoptic scale activity in the Mediterranean region. Enhanced blocking activity in the 50\u00b0\u201370\u00b0E sector favours an eastward extension of Atlantic jet, and the associated instabilities are related to extreme precipitation events over large parts of central and Eastern Europe. We argue that these two distinct blocking patterns explain a substantial part of extreme precipitation variability in Romania during summer.\n",

It quantifies ensemble spread using two contrasting measures\u00a0\u2013\u00a0standard deviation and 10\u201390th percentile range. The study then evaluates and examines the characteristics of long-term trends in the ensemble spread in relation to trends in the ensemble mean and in the observational record, by considering the skill of the monthly mean precipitation and near surface air temperature simulations. Results provide evidence that variations in ensemble spreads generated by the atmospheric model used in this study reflect fundamental properties of atmospheric variability in the real climate system. We find significant long-term trends in the measures of spread, with a general coastal\u2013inland gradient, suggesting the possibility of existence of interannual variations in the potential range of seasonal climate simulations over South Africa. We also find robust relationships between trends in the observational record, in the simulated ensemble means and in measures of the simulated ensemble spread. Irrespective of the direction of trends, the correspondence of higher model skill when trends in the ensemble spread are larger suggests that the skill produced by a dynamical modelling system may not be independent of the model ability to capture the real atmospheric trends in whatever the model is simulating or forecasting. Therefore, based on historical data, further understanding of how potential predictability is changing has the prospect to improve the interpretation of current estimates of simulation skill.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOver the past decades, a continuous rise in global air temperatures resulted in significant changes in the global hydrological cycle. Regionally increased frequencies of extreme weather events and changes in the regional extent of drylands resulted in new areas at risk of desertification, a complex process driven by socio-economic and climate-related factors. Although desertification is not confined to drylands, they are the most vulnerable to land degradation processes. To investigate possible changes in climate patterns over the past 60\u2009years, we couple the information obtained from the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger (KG) climate classification and the FAO aridity index (AI), providing an overview of the most evident global changes in climate regimes from 1951\u20131980 to 1981\u20132010 and focussing on the modifications of the extent of drylands. KG and AI indicators have been computed on a 0.5\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u00b0 global grid using precipitation data from the Full Data Reanalysis (v6.0) of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration data from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (CRUTSv3.20). Both KG and AI show that the arid areas globally increased between 1951\u20131980 and 1981\u20132010, but decreased on average in the Americas. North-Eastern Brazil, Southern Argentina, the Sahel, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Mediterranean area, North-Eastern China and Sub-Himalayan India have been identified as areas with a significant increase of drylands extent. An analysis of the scientific literature gives evidence that most of the areas identified are effectively undergoing desertification, thus confirming the validity of AI and KG to highlight the areas under risk of desertification. We also discuss the global decrease of cold areas, the progressive change from continental to temperate climate in Central Europe, the shift from tundra to continental climate in Alaska, Canada and North-Eastern Russia and the widening of the tropical belt.\n",

This holds in particular for vulnerable regions, such as the Levant, already subjected to decrease in rainfall and lengthening of dry spells, in agreement with predictions of climatic models for the coming decades. This is the first comprehensive study which identifies atmospheric patterns responsible for PDS occurrence on thousands of kilometres scale. A total of 178 PDSs, of >7\u2009days, were found within the 62 seasons studied.\nA subjective inspection of upper-level geopotential height (GPH), sea-level pressure (SLP) and lower-level temperature anomalies point at three types, each associated with a definite climatic regime. The \u2018subtropical\u2019 type is associated with an expansion of the subtropical high over the majority of the Mediterranean, accompanied by northward migration of the Mediterranean cyclone track. The \u2018baroclinic\u2019, the most frequent type, is induced by a pronounced stagnant ridge over the eastern Mediterranean, being a part of Rossby wave, accompanied by a pronounced trough/cut-off low over the western Mediterranean. The \u2018polar\u2019 type results from intrusion of lower-level continental polar air associated with upper-level trough east of the Levant and blocking high over central Europe. Quantitative indices were derived for objective classification of the types, based on the climatic regimes defined subjectively, and the centers of action representing each.\nComposite maps for each type indicate substantial differences in the synoptic configuration and the factors explaining absence of rain. For the subtropical type, the dynamic factor of subsidence is dominant. For the polar, the thermodynamic factor of continental dry advection is dominant and for the baroclinic, both dynamic and thermodynamic factors are important.\nClassification of PDSs according to synoptic scenarios enables analysis of future changes in the occurrence and duration pattern of PDSs, using output of climate models.\n",

Furthermore, the contributions of moisture originating from the land area, western Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean to the precipitation in the three sub-regions of East China are quantitatively estimated. The results indicate that during summertime, the transport of moisture from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific dominates the precipitation in SC, with almost equivalent contributions; evaporation over the land area seems to be the key contributor to the precipitation in YRV and NC, followed by the evaporation over the western Pacific. During wintertime, the precipitated moisture in SC originates largely from the western Pacific, while evaporation over the land area is the predominant contributor to the precipitation in YRV and NC. The results of this study indicate that the precipitation in the three sub-regions of East China reflect the contributions of the Indian monsoon and East Asian summer monsoon to different degrees.\n",

The use of such datasets is ubiquitous, but their inherent limitations are largely unknown or overlooked particularly in regard to spatial uncertainty and climate trends. To address these limitations, we present a statistical framework for producing a 30-arcsec (\u223c800-m) resolution gridded dataset of daily minimum and maximum temperature and related uncertainty from 1948 to 2012 for the conterminous United States. Like other datasets, we use weather station data and elevation-based predictors of temperature, but also implement a unique spatio-temporal interpolation that incorporates remotely sensed 1-km land skin temperature. The framework is able to capture several complex topoclimatic variations, including minimum temperature inversions, and represent spatial uncertainty in interpolated normal temperatures. Overall mean absolute errors for annual normal minimum and maximum temperature are 0.78 and 0.56\u2009\u00b0C, respectively. Homogenization of input station data also allows interpolated temperature trends to be more consistent with US Historical Climate Network trends compared to those of existing interpolated topoclimatic datasets. The framework and resulting temperature data can be an invaluable tool for spatially explicit ecological and hydrological modelling and for facilitating better end-user understanding and community-driven improvement of these widely used datasets.\n",

TRMM 3B42 v7 rainfall data is validated with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall data at 0.5\u00b0 resolution over the WG. The analysis of spatial pattern of monsoon rainfall with orography of the WG ascertains that the grade of orographic precipitation depends mainly on topography of the mountain barrier followed by steepness of windward side slope and altitude of the mountain. Longer and broader, i.e. cascaded topography, elevated summits and gradually increasing slopes impel the enhancement in precipitation. Comparing topography of various states of the WG, it has been observed that windward side of Karnataka receives intense rainfall in the WG during summer monsoon. It has been observed that the rainfall is enhanced before the peak of the mountain and confined up to the height about 800\u2009m over the WG. In addition to this, the spatial distribution of heavy and very heavy rainfall events in the last 14 years has also been explored. Heavy and very heavy rain events on this hilly terrain are categorized with a threshold of precipitation (R) in the range 150\u2009>\u2009R\u2009>\u2009120\u2009mm\u2009day\u22121 and exceeding 150\u2009mm\u2009day\u22121 using probability distribution of TRMM 3B42 v7 rainfall.

The MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS MCD43A3) albedo product was used to study MG's snow and ice albedo, evaluated against supraglacial automatic weather station (AWS) observations. In general, by the end of the mass balance year (EBY), MG's AWS observed bare ice albedo reached \u223c0.3 only just exceeding values observed for proglacial bedrock (\u223c0.2). The analysis reveals negative mean trends in the MODIS-derived MG EBY albedo for the period 2000\u20132013 with a significant decline in mean glacier-wide albedo of 0.10. The greatest decline in albedo, of 0.25, occurred near the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), an important surface cover and albedo transitional zone. The EBY albedo correlates significantly with ELA and net winter and summer glacier mass balance records.\n",

A 2-year time series of energy balance measurements was made at a small reservoir situated in southeast Queensland, Australia. Measurements were used to establish diurnal, intra-seasonal and seasonal cycles of evaporation, while synoptic weather maps and local weather station data were used to relate variations in water surface\u2013atmosphere energy exchanges to synoptic and mesoscale weather phenomena. Consistent diurnal peaks in latent heat flux during the afternoon were observed throughout this study as a result of strong dry winds coinciding with peak water surface temperatures. Occasional intra-seasonal pulses in latent heat flux (i.e. evaporation) in winter and spring were associated with the passage of cold fronts over southern Queensland, which brought strong dry westerly winds. The average annual evaporative water loss from the reservoir during the 2-year measurement campaign was 991\u2009mm year\u22121. It is thought that differences between the annual evaporation totals for the 2 years of this study may have been related to differences in the frequency of overcast conditions as a result of a change in the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.\n",

Accurate measurement of rainfall is essential for various water-related applications, the evaluation of numerical models and detection and attribution of trends, but a variety of different gridded rainfall datasets are available for these purposes. In this study, six gridded rainfall datasets are compared against the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall dataset, chosen as the most representative of the observed system due to its high gauge density. The datasets comprise those based solely on rain gauge observations and those merging rain gauge data with satellite-derived products. Various skill metrics and subjective comparisons are carried out for the Indian region during the southwest monsoon season (June\u2013September). Relative biases and skill metrics are documented at all-India and subregional scales. In the gauge-based (land-only) category, Asian Precipitation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of water resources (APHRODITE) and Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) datasets perform better relative to the others in terms of a variety of skill metrics. In the merged category, the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) dataset is shown to perform better than the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) for the Indian monsoon in terms of various metrics, when compared with the IMD gridded data. Most of the datasets have difficulties in representing rainfall over orographic regions including the Western Ghats mountains, in Northeast India and the Himalayan foothills. The wide range of skill metrics seen among the datasets and even the change of sign of bias found in some years are causes of concern. This uncertainty between datasets is largest in Northeast India. These results will help those studying the Indian monsoon region to select an appropriate dataset depending on their application and focus of research.\n",

A histogram derived from the hourly LWd time-series revealed a positively (right) skewed frequency distribution.

The spatial pattern and intensity of the PMM were found to be reasonably simulated by CMIP5 models, as was the subtropical atmosphere\u2013ocean coupling associated with the PMM. However, the persistence of the coupling, which sustains the PMM's duration and extends its pattern equatorward, was found to be underestimated in most of the CMIP5 models. Many of the simulated PMMs do not have a pattern that extends far enough into the tropical Pacific to influence El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The CMIP5 models that do produce longer persistence for the PMM coupling show a higher correlation of the PMM with the Central-Pacific (CP) type of ENSO than with the Eastern-Pacific (EP) type of the ENSO. This study concludes that (1) the PMM and its associated subtropical Pacific ocean\u2013atmosphere coupling are important to the generation of the CP type of ENSO; (2) the so-called seasonal footprinting mechanism that sustains an equatorward extension of the PMM is not well simulated in a majority of the CMIP5 models; and (3) the persistence of the subtropical Pacific coupling is more important than the other properties in gauging a model's skill in the PMM simulation.\n",

This study therefore attempts to identify the predictors (with a 1-month lead time) for some of the subregional intraseasonal statistics of wet and dry spells (SRISS) which showed the greatest predictability potential during the short rainfall season over EEA. Correlation analysis between the SRISS and seasonal rainfall totals on one hand and the predefined predictors on the other hand were initially computed and those that were significant at 95% confidence levels retained. To identify additional potential predictors, partial correlation analyses were undertaken between SRISS and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric fields while controlling the effects of the predefined predictors retained earlier. Cross-validated multivariate linear regression (MLR) models were finally developed and their residuals assessed for independence and for normal distribution. Four large-scale oceanic and atmospheric predictors with robust physical/dynamical linkages with SRISS were identified for the first time. The cross-validated MLR models for the SRISS of wet spells and seasonal rainfall totals mainly picked two of these predictors around the Bay of Bengal. The two predictors combined accounted for 39.5% of the magnitude of the SST changes between the July\u2013August and October\u2013November\u2013December periods over the Western Pole of the Indian Ocean Dipole, subsequently impacting EEA rainfall. MLR models were defined yielding cross-validated correlations between observed and predicted values of seasonal totals and number of wet days ranging from 0.60 to 0.75, depending on the subregion. MLR models could not be developed over a few of the subregions suggesting that the local factors could have masked the global and regional signals encompassed in the additional potential predictors.\n",

The reanalyses data sets were used due to lack of suitable neighbouring stations and also to test reanalyses as proxy data. A list of probable shifts is produced and will be used to support future global reanalyses. Moreover, temperature and pressure series were adjusted using adjustment factors that were obtained by calculating the difference between certain periods before and after the breaks. The accuracy of the adjusted series was verified subjectively (visually) and objectively using three verification methods: correlation coefficient, central root-mean-square error and standard deviation. A positive impact of the applied adjustment in terms of all three scores was found in a majority of cases.\n",

During that time period, land use changed from primarily forest to cropland in India, eastern China, and Europe. This study used an atmospheric general circulation model, Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 3.2, coupled with a land surface scheme, Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff. The results showed that HLUC decreased rainfall amounts by more than 2\u2009mm\u2009day\u22121 during the onset phase and delayed the onset date of the local rainy season by approximately four pentads over the Indian subcontinent. The onset date over southeastern China was also delayed by four pentads. The changes in precipitation and the onset of the local rainy season result from the change in the surface water budget induced by HLUC, as discussed in previous work. Although ISM circulation activity, defined by a large-scale land\u2013sea thermal contrast, was slightly decreased from late May to early June, its onset date did not change. Thus, in the onset phase, HLUC affected the local rainy season onset over the same region, although the ISM circulation was weakened only marginally, showing no change in its onset timing. Hence, unlike the broad-scale ISM circulation onset, the beginning of the local rainy season is dominantly influenced by local surface conditions.\n",

Most models exhibited varying degrees of skills, depending on the region and season, whereas a few models were identified as performing well globally, including the CMCC models, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and BCC-CSM1.1M. Models with the highest and lowest climate sensitivities, as well as those that project future climate changes most resembling the MME mean, were identified. The future precipitation and temperature changes projected by the MPI models and NCAR-CESM1 models were found to best resemble the overall MME. Finer resolution was found to improve model performance in simulating historical climate in most regions and seasons, particularly for temperature; however, it does not have a significant effect on the response of model climates to future GHGs scenarios. We found that no model can simultaneously exhibits good performance in simulating historical climate and in projecting a future climate that is close to the MME mean. Determining the \u2018best\u2019 overall model is difficult because \u2018best\u2019 is dependent on the specific applications for which a model will be used. Evaluating climate models is an important step to build confidence in their application for impact assessment.

In combination with NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis 850-hPa wind field and 160 stations' precipitation data in China, an intimate connection between the tropical Pacific SsT and eastern China summer precipitation anomalies is discovered by examining the time-lagged and simultaneous correlations among the interannual anomalies of SsT in the tropical Pacific, the 850-hPa wind pattern and summer rainfall in China. In previous winter, if the SsT in the tropical Pacific indicates an El Ni\u00f1o-type anomaly, an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the East Asian coast, South China Sea and east of Taiwan along with a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the Japanese archipelago emerges in following summer. At the same time, a cyclonic circulation and an anticyclonic circulation prevail over the Lake Baikal and Kuril Islands in the high latitude. These combined circulation patterns facilitate the southward transport of cold air from high latitude and northward transport of warm and moist air through the western edge of the subtropical high. The meet between two air masses results in significantly abundant anomalous precipitation in the Sichuan Basin, Dongting and Poyang Lake Basin, and possibly deficit precipitation occurs over the Hetao region and lower Yellow River Basin, northern Zhejiang, as well as the coastal region of southern China and southern Yunnan. These findings offer a very useful predictive power for eastern China summer precipitation based on tropical Pacific SsT status in previous winter and subsequent developments of SsT and East Asian large-scale circulations.\n",

At European scale, both SWD and ETA did not change significantly between 1951 and 2011. However, significant increases in SWD were found in southern Europe, except in western Turkey, whereas in northern Europe changes in SWD remain small. ETA increased significantly as a joint response to increased air temperature and precipitation in northern Europe.\nUsing the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and the Pearson correlation coefficients (RPearson), we showed that large-scale agricultural droughts are influenced by the recurrence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and by the atmospheric blocking. Atmospheric blocking in different months throughout the year and extreme NAO index (mainly in winter months) contribute to the severity of agricultural droughts. During a negative phase of NAO, storms over the North Atlantic and Europe are less frequent and as a consequence dry weather in Europe is observed. Positive NAO influences agricultural drought in Europe by shifting storms tracks from the North Atlantic onto European continent to more northerly paths, which in turn decreases the amount of precipitation over central Europe.\nLarge SWDs are mainly influenced by atmospheric blocking. Notably, winter blocking increases severity of agricultural droughts in southwestern Europe, while summer blocking influences agricultural droughts in southeastern Europe. Notwithstanding, the first three EOFs contribute to less than 40% of the total spatial variability of SWD. This shows that agricultural droughts are complex phenomena that can be only partly explained by extreme NAO or by intensive atmospheric blocking.\n",

Snowpack water storage is also a critical water resource and understanding how it varies is of great social value. Models are often employed to reconstruct snowpack and explore and understand snow cover variability. Here, we use a new, accurate satellite-derived snow product to evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, combined with the Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP), to simulate snow cover fraction (SCF) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in a 3-km domain over the central Sierra Nevada. WRF/Noah-MP SWE simulations improve on previous versions of the Noah land surface model by removing an early bias in snow melt, though a 2-day positive melt bias in SWE timing remains significant at the 90% confidence level. In addition, WRF/Noah-MP identifies the areas where snow is present to within 94.3% and captures large-scale variability in SCF. Temporal root mean squared error (RMSE) of the domain-average SCF was 1938.6\u2009km2 (24%). However, our study shows that WRF/Noah-MP struggles to simulate SCF at finer spatial scales. The parameterization for SCF fails to produce temporal variations in grid-scale SCF, and depletion occurs too rapidly. As a result, the WRF/Noah-MP SCF parameterization reduces to a binary function in mountain environments. Sensitivity tests show that adjustment of the parameterization may improve simulation of SCF during accumulation or melt but does not remove the bias for the entire snow season. Although WRF/Noah-MP accurately simulates the presence or absence of snow, high-resolution, reliable SCF estimates may only be attainable if snow depletion parameterizations are designed specifically for complex topographical areas.\n",

Ascendant hierarchical clustering is used to evaluate how well South African recurrent daily rainfall patterns are simulated during the austral summer (December to February 1970\u20131971 to 1998\u20131999). A set of 35-km regional climate simulations, run with the WRF model and driven by the ERA40 reanalysis, is chosen as a case study. Six recurrent patterns are identified and compared to the observed clusters obtained by applying the same methodology to 5352 daily rain gauge records. Two of the WRF clusters describe either a persistent and widespread dryness (65% of the days) or patterns similar to the seasonal mean rainfall gradient (13% of the days). The four remaining WRF clusters (\u223c20% of the days) are wetter; they describe the weakening, conservation or strengthening of the average rainfall gradient. The WRF cluster rainfall patterns and their associated circulation match the observed clusters rather well, but their frequency of occurrence is greatly overestimated by WRF during dry events, and underestimated for near-normal rainfall conditions. The weak model biases found at the seasonal timescale conceal strongly biased intraseasonal rainfall variability. The WRF-simulated rainfall patterns are then temporally or spatially projected on to the observed clusters. Spatial projection proves to be the more useful of these two approaches in quantifying model skill by assessing both the temporal co-variability between WRF and observations, and the rainfall biases of the model with or without temporal dephasing. The WRF model simulates transient rainfall activity partially out of phase with observations, which induces large rainfall biases when temporal dephasing is not removed. Rainfall biases are significantly reduced, however, when temporal dephasing is removed. The clustering approach therefore proves its efficiency to highlight climate model strengths and deficiencies.\n",

However, large-scale network analyses investigating spatial aspects of pre-instrumental drought variability for this biogeographic zone are still scarce. In this study we introduce 54 mid- to high-elevation tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies comprising 2186 individual series from pine trees (Pinus spp.). This compilation spans a 4000-km east\u2013west transect from Spain to Turkey, and was subjected to quality control and standardization prior to the development of site chronologies. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify spatial growth patterns during the network's common period 1862\u20131976, and new composite TRW chronologies were developed and investigated. The PCA reveals a common variance of 19.7% over the 54 Mediterranean pine chronologies. More interestingly, a dipole pattern in growth variability is found between the western (15% explained variance) and eastern (9.6%) sites, persisting back to 1330 AD. Pine growth on the Iberian Peninsula and Italy favours warm early growing seasons, but summer drought is most critical for ring width formation in the eastern Mediterranean region. Synoptic climate dynamics that have been in operation for the last seven centuries have been identified as the driving mechanism of a distinct east\u2013west dipole in the growth variability of Mediterranean pines.\n",

TYs coming within a 300-km buffer zone around the four main islands of Japan (JZOI) are grouped into two main types: those that remain on the Pacific Coast (PC) and those that enter the Japan Sea (JS). Results indicate that fewer TYs enter the JZOI when the NPSH extends strongly to the west and more reach Japan when it extends to the northwest. The winds around the periphery of the NPSH affect the recurvature of TYs directing them either west towards the China Mainland or around the western edge of the high towards Japan. More importantly, during periods when greater numbers of TYs affect the PC side of Japan (PC+), the NPSH extends to the southwest. However, during periods when greater numbers of TYs affect JS side of Japan (JS+), the NPSH extends to the northwest closer to Japan. The southwest extension of the NPSH enables TYs to recurve and pass to the eastern side (PC) of Japan while the northwest extension forces TYs around or across Japan into the JS. An important finding is that the moderately different positions of the NPSH change the atmospheric circulation around Japan dramatically and affect whether TYs pass over the PC side or the JS coast side of Japan. At the interannual time scale, increased JS+ years were observed since 1980 because of the frequent occurrence of the Pacific-Japan pattern. We also found that at the interdecadal time scale, PC+ years have increased due to the southwestward extension of the NPSH since 1980.\n",

Urban floods are mainly caused by short duration extreme events. Hence, robust information on changes in extreme precipitation at high-temporal resolution is required for the design of climate change adaptation measures. However, the quantification of these changes is challenging and subject to numerous uncertainties.\nThis study assesses the changes and uncertainties in extreme precipitation at hourly scale over Denmark. It explores three statistical downscaling approaches: a delta change method for extreme events, a weather generator combined with a disaggregation method and a climate analogue method. All three methods rely on different assumptions and use different outputs from the regional climate models (RCMs). The results of the three methods point towards an increase in extreme precipitation but the magnitude of the change varies depending on the RCM used and the spatial location. In general, a similar mean change is obtained for the three methods. This adds confidence in the results as each method uses different information from the RCMs. The results of this study highlight the need of using a range of statistical downscaling methods as well as RCMs to assess changes in extreme precipitation.\n",

The enhanced early winter NAO variability originates mainly at the southern node of the NAO but is also related to the more variable GBI in December. Transition seasons (spring and autumn) have remained relatively unchanged over the last 30\u2009years. These results are corroborated using several NAO indices. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) index, although strongly correlated with the NAO, does not show the recent sustained significant summer decrease, but it does show enhanced early winter variability. These recent observed changes are not present in the current generation of global climate models, although the latest process studies do offer insight into their causes.

Precipitation simulations from 14 different 40-year downscaling experiments (1961\u20132000) driven by the ERA-40 reanalysis from the ENSEMBLES project are analysed in terms of realistic reproduction of spatial and temporal seasonal precipitation patterns over Slovenia. The best RCM performance was found for winter when precipitation is mainly caused by large-scale processes. A significantly lower model performance was observed for summer when precipitation is mainly caused by convective processes. Indeed, the largest spread of simulated precipitation between ensemble members was observed in summer, which is likely due to differences in the simulation of convective processes by the models. In addition, the simulations were analysed using partial least-square regression to quantify dependence of the simulated precipitation on physiographic factors. The applied regression model showed that orography and longitude are the most important variables associated with the spatial variability of precipitation in Slovenia. The empirical orthogonal functions were used to analyse the spatial patterns of inter-annual precipitation variability. The analysis showed that all models reproduced the most dominant mode of variability, but significant differences occurred between the models, especially in summer. In general, a thorough analysis has shown that the quality of simulations is highly variable among different regions as well as for different seasons.\n",

Statistical properties of the gap filled precipitation data are compared with those of the original data to ensure that this approach preserves the statistical characteristics of the historical data. After gap filling missing data, 10 precipitation indices that represent magnitude and frequency of precipitation properties were computed from those 9 stations and the other 20 stations without missing records. Next, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to detect possible change points of these precipitation indices. Based on the analysed results, there had been an increasing trend in the maximum number of consecutive wet days and the annual maximum 1-day precipitation and a decrease in the maximum number of consecutive dry days over most of British Columbia (BC). The annual total precipitation index of many stations had increased in southern BC and decreased in central parts of Canadian Prairies.

Diagnoses of the atmospheric thermodynamic conditions over the East Asian\u2013Western North Pacific (EAWNP) region indicate that the area favourable for the FC formation (i.e. the area with a locally enhanced meridional temperature gradient) has shifted northward from 20o\u201330oN to north of 30oN during the recent three decades; this shift has led to a decline in FC numbers over Taiwan and Southeast China. Analyses also indicate that the recent increase in DC activities over Taiwan and Southeast China after 1982 occurred in association with an observed strengthening of the daytime land\u2013sea thermal contrast coupled with an intensification of the afternoon sea-breeze over the EAWNP region and a locally enhanced moisture flux convergence over Taiwan and Southeast China. Possible causes for the observed changes in the atmospheric thermodynamic conditions over the EAWNP region are also discussed.\n",

        "description": "\nLimited research has been performed examining the relationships between southeast US wildfire and weather type patterns using modern techniques and data sets. The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between wildfire ignitions in the central Gulf Coast, United States and weather type occurrences in an effort to identify regional patterns associated with wildfire ignitions. Wildfire occurrence data are obtained for nine national forests in the central Gulf Coast for the period 1970 to 2011. The Spatial Synoptic Classification scheme (SSC) is used to classify daily weather type variations for each national forest. Years with high numbers of ignitions experience statistically higher numbers of dry tropical (DT) weather types than years with low numbers of ignitions in five of nine national forests. These differences range from 17 to 160% more DT days during periods of high ignitions. Statistically significant positive Spearman rank correlations exist between annual number of ignitions and annual number of DT days in a given forest. While understanding such relationships on an annual scale is useful, it says nothing about the actual timing of weather types leading up to an ignition. An analysis of weather type activity 30, 90, and 180 days prior to ignitions reveals that the median ratio of DT days to moist moderate (MM) and moist tropical (MT) days is statistically higher for periods leading up to a fire. Positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) result in an increased number of DT days. This confirms previous studies that have suggested the strength of the westerlies increases during the positive phase of the NAO, driving DT weather types eastward from their southwest US/Mexico source region. We can therefore also conclude that the positive phase of the NAO is linked with increased wildfire activity in the central Gulf Coast, United States.\n",

Among these, low-frequency variations can substantially modify the performance of a wind power plant during its lifetime. In recent years, other temporal scales such as the short-term variability or the climatological conditions of wind and the corresponding generated power have been investigated in depth. However, the study of longer decadal and multidecadal variations is still in its early stages.\nIn this work, the wind power output long-term variability is analysed for two locations in Spain, during the period 1871\u20132009. This is attained by computing the annual wind speed probability density functions derived from an ensemble of atmospheric sea level pressure data set through a statistical downscaling based in evolutionary algorithms. Results reveal significant trends and periodicities in multidecadal bands including 13, 25 and 46\u2009years, as well as significant differences among both sites. The impact of the leading large-scale circulation patterns (NAO, EA, SCAND and AMO) on wind power output and its stationarity is analysed. Results on both locations show non-stationary significant and opposite seasonal couplings with these forcings. Finally, the long-term variability of the reconstructed Weibull parameters of the annual wind speed distributions is used to derive a linear model to estimate the annual wind power.\n",

Preseason climatic/oceanic signals of the El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Sahel rainfall (20\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N, 20\u00b0W\u201310\u00b0E) and the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) across a selected domain, all of which are closely associated with the dominant principal components of the North Atlantic Hurricane Track Density Function (HTDF), are applied as predictors.\nWhile using the Poisson regression without dividing the season into differing levels of activity types greatly degrades the model, classification of season types [based on accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)] before using the Poisson regression, can significantly improve the model performance. With this proposed new methodology, landfall counts in hyperactive and above-normal season type years can be predicted with 56.01 and 71.36% skill improvements respectively, compared with merely using climatology.\n",

This study focused on the long-term wind and wave in the central BoB from 1979 to 2012 based on the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data sets. Data were validated with the nearest available buoy data for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, and good correlation was observed (root mean square error\u2009\u2248\u20090.17\u20130.43\u2009m). A clear seasonality was noted with intensified wind and waves during the southwest monsoon season. We observed statistically declining trends in the mean and extreme wind speed (90th percentile) with increasing trend in extreme significant wave height (SWH). Seasonal analysis also investigated and found that the stronger events/winds during the southwest (SW) monsoon season are weakening. Conflicting trends in the wind and wave height were mainly due to the swell dominance at the region which was identified by the separate trend analysis of wind-sea and swell height. The area average analysis is carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the identified trend results for the point location and found similar trends for extreme wind speed and SWH. The high (>5\u2009m) annual maximum SWH in the study area was attributed to the influence of tropical cyclones in the BoB, and all of these high waves occurred before 1996 indicating that the influence of tropical cyclones in the study area decreased after 1996.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSoil moisture dynamics and their temporal trends in the Czech Republic are forced by various drivers. The methodology of applying remotely sensed data with both high temporal and spatial resolutions provides detailed insight and objective quantification of the causes of changes in soil moisture patterns. Our analysis of temporal trends indicates that shifts in drought severity between 1961 and 2012 (especially in the April, May, and June period, which displayed a 50% increase in drought probability between 1961\u20131980 and 2001\u20132012) are alarming. We found that increased global radiation and air temperature together with decreased relative humidity (all statistically significant at the 0.05 level) led to increases in the reference evapotranspiration in all months of the growing season; this trend was particularly evident in April, May, and August, when more than 80% of the territory displayed an increased demand for soil water. This finding was shown to be consistent with the measured pan evaporation (1968\u20132012) that was characterized by increasing trends, particularly during the April\u2013June period. These changes, in combination with the earlier end of snow cover and the earlier start of growing season (up to 20\u2009days in some regions), led to an increased actual evapotranspiration at the start of growing season that tends to deplete the soil moisture earlier, leaving the soil more exposed to the impacts of rainfall variability. These results support concerns related to the potentially increased severity of drought events in Central Europe. The reported trend patterns are of particular importance with respect to the expected climate change, given the robustness and consistency of the trends shown and the fact that they can be aligned with the existing climate model projections.\n",

The analysis identified a significant negative correlation between the land\u2013air temperature difference and the spring rainfall over North China. The analysis results suggested that the sinking motion and northeasterly anomalies were dominated over North China. These anomalous northeasterly winds substantially weakened the amount of moisture supplied to North China and are helpful for a decrease in the humidity over North China. Moreover, the decrease in sea level pressure was caused by an increase in surface air temperature. The North China was located to the west of Low system where divergence and sinking motion were favoured. The results also suggested that the positive sensible heat flux anomalies and negative latent heat flux anomalies over North China were induced by an increase in the land\u2013air temperature difference. The increase in surface downward solar radiation association with a decrease in low clouds may cause an increase in surface air temperature and decrease in relative humidity, which in turn contributed to a decrease in spring rainfall over North China. These results suggested that there was a strong negative feedback mechanism between the temperature difference and rainfall.\n",

        "description": "\n\nStatistical results reveal the close relationship between the hazy days in eastern China and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. A significant negative correlation coefficient (CC) centre is located in the western Pacific, while a positive CC centre is located in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Case analyses also confirm that an El Nino (La Nina) event is more likely to bring more (less) hazy days during winter. The key circulation pattern for less haze includes stronger Siberian high and Aleutian low pressure systems, stronger northerly wind over eastern Asia, and also a stronger high-level subtropical westerly jet (i.e. stronger East Asian winter monsoon, EAWM). While more haze often occurs under weaker EAWM pattern. The influencing mechanism of the ENSO event could be explained first, by how it alters the pressure and thermal differences between the Asian continent and the western Pacific Ocean, second, by the change of the circulation pattern of EAWM, and finally by the effect of the northerlies at higher latitudes. Compared to the relationship between ENSO and EAWM, the ENSO\u2013haze relationship is more stable. Results also indicate an ENSO event has a leading influence on the haze frequency and can be used as a predictor in the seasonal forecasts of hazy days.\n",
