Camenisch<br /><br />This paper applies the methods of historical climatology to present a\nclimate reconstruction for the area of the Burgundian Low Countries during\nthe 15th century. The results are based on documentary evidence that\nhas been handled very carefully, especially with regard to the distinction\nbetween contemporary and non-contemporary sources. Approximately 3000\nwritten records derived from about 100 different sources were examined and\nconverted into seasonal seven-degree indices for temperature and\nprecipitation. For the Late Middle Ages only a few climate reconstructions\nexist. There are even fewer reconstructions which include spring and autumn\ntemperature or any precipitation information at all. This paper therefore constitutes a\nuseful contribution to the understanding of climate and weather conditions\nin the less well researched but highly interesting 15th century. The\nextremely cold winter temperatures during the 1430s and an extremely cold\nwinter in 1407/1408 are striking. Moreover, no other year in this century was\nas hot and dry as 1473. At the beginning and the end of the 1480s and at the\nbeginning of the 1490s summers were considerably wetter than average.",

It is associated with a large global\ncooling during the following year, felt particularly in parts of Europe and\nNorth America, where the year 1816 became known as the \"year without a\nsummer\". This paper describes an effort made to collect surface\nmeteorological observations from the early instrumental period, with a focus\non the years of and immediately following the eruption (1815\u20131817). Although\nthe collection aimed in particular at pressure observations, correspondent\ntemperature observations were also recovered. Some of the series had already\nbeen described in the literature, but a large part of the data, recently\ndigitised from original weather diaries and contemporary magazines and\nnewspapers, is presented here for the first time. The collection puts\ntogether more than 50 sub-daily series from land observatories in Europe\nand North America and from ships in the tropics. The pressure observations\nhave been corrected for temperature and gravity and reduced to mean sea\nlevel. Moreover, an additional statistical correction was applied to take into\naccount common error sources in mercury barometers. To assess the reliability\nof the corrected data set, the variance in the pressure observations is\ncompared with modern climatologies, and single observations are used for\nsynoptic analyses of three case studies in Europe. All raw observations will\nbe made available to the scientific community in the International Surface\nPressure Databank.",

The upper part of the PETM is\ntruncated, either due to drilling disturbance or a sedimentary hiatus. An\nintact record of the onset of the PETM is indicated by a gradual decrease in\n\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C values over 20 cm, followed by a 14 cm interval in which\n\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C is 2 &permil; lighter than uppermost Paleocene values. After\naccounting for effects of diagenetic alteration, we use \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O and\nMg/Ca values from foraminiferal tests to determine that intermediate\nand surface waters warmed by ~5\u20136\u00b0 at the onset of the PETM\nprior to the full development of the negative \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C excursion. After\nthis initial warming, sea temperatures were relatively stable through the\nPETM but declined abruptly across the horizon that truncates the event at\nthis site. Mg/Ca analysis of foraminiferal tests indicates peak\nintermediate and surface water temperatures of ~19 and\n~32 \u00b0C, respectively. These temperatures may be influenced by\nresidual diagenetic factors and changes in ocean circulation, and surface water\nvalues may also be biased towards warm-season temperatures.",

J. Coletti, R. M. DeConto, J. Brigham-Grette, and M. Melles<br /><br />Until now, the lack of time-continuous, terrestrial paleoenvironmental\ndata from the Pleistocene Arctic has made model simulations of past\ninterglacials difficult to assess. Here, we compare climate simulations of\nfour warm interglacials at Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 1 (9 ka), 5e (127 ka),\n11c (409 ka) and 31 (1072 ka) with new proxy climate data recovered from\nLake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia. Climate reconstructions of the mean temperature\nof the warmest month (MTWM) indicate conditions up to 0.4, 2.1, 0.5 and 3.1 \u00b0C warmer than today during MIS 1, 5e, 11c and 31,\nrespectively. While the climate model captures much of the observed warming\nduring each interglacial, largely in response to boreal summer (JJA) orbital\nforcing, the extraordinary warmth of MIS 11c compared to the other\ninterglacials in the Lake El'gygytgyn temperature proxy reconstructions\nremains difficult to explain. To deconvolve the contribution of multiple\ninfluences on interglacial warming at Lake El'gygytgyn, we isolated the\ninfluence of vegetation, sea ice and circum-Arctic land ice feedbacks on\nthe modeled climate of the Beringian interior. Simulations accounting for\nclimate\u2013vegetation\u2013land-surface feedbacks during all four interglacials show\nexpanding boreal forest cover with increasing summer insolation intensity. A\ndeglaciated Greenland is shown to have a minimal effect on northeast Asian\ntemperature during the warmth of stages 11c and 31 (Melles et al., 2012). A prescribed\nenhancement of oceanic heat transport into the Arctic Ocean does have some\neffect on Lake El'gygytgyn's regional climate, but the exceptional warmth of\nMIS l1c remains enigmatic compared to the modest orbital and greenhouse gas\nforcing during that interglacial.",

Landais, H. Toy\u00e9 Mahamadou Kele, M. Guillevic, P. Kindler, F. Parrenin, and P. Martinerie<br /><br />A recent coherent chronology has been built for four Antarctic ice cores and the\nNorthGRIP (NGRIP) Greenland ice core (Antarctic Ice Core Chronology 2012,\nAICC2012) using a Bayesian approach for ice core dating (Datice). When\nbuilding the AICC2012 chronology, and in order to prevent any confusion with\nofficial ice core chronology, the AICC2012 chronology for NGRIP was forced to\nfit exactly the GICC05 chronology based on layer counting. However, such a\nstrong tuning did not satisfy the hypothesis of independence of background\nparameters and observations for the NGRIP core, as required by Datice. We\npresent here the implementation in Datice of a new type of markers that is\nbetter suited for constraints deduced from layer counting: the duration\nconstraints. Estimating the global error on chronology due to such markers is\nnot straightforward and implies some assumption on the correlation between\nindividual counting errors for each interval of duration. We validate this\nnew methodological implementation by conducting twin experiments and a\nposteriori diagnostics on the NGRIP ice core. Several sensitivity tests on\nmarker sampling and correlation between counting errors were performed to\nprovide some guidelines when using such a method for future dating\nexperiments. Finally, using these markers for NGRIP in a five-core\ndating exercise with Datice leads to new chronologies that do not differ by\nmore than 410 years from AICC2012 for Antarctic ice cores and 150 years from\nGICC05 for NGRIP over the last 60 000 years.",

Zanchettin, O. Bothe, F. Lehner, P. Ortega, C. C. Raible, and D.

Here, we\nillustrate the contrast between an interdecadal strong positive phase of the\nwinter Pacific/North American pattern (PNA) in the early 19th century\nthat is described by a PNA reconstruction based on tree rings from\nnorthwestern North America, and a slight tendency towards negative winter\nPNA anomalies during the same period in an ensemble of state-of-the-art\ncoupled climate simulations. Additionally, a pseudo-proxy investigation with\nthe same simulation ensemble allows for assessing the robustness of PNA\nreconstructions using solely geophysical predictors from northwestern North\nAmerica for the last millennium. The reconstructed early 19th-century\npositive PNA anomaly emerges as a potentially reliable feature, although the\npseudo-reconstructions are subject to a number of sources of uncertainty and\ndeficiencies highlighted especially at multidecadal and centennial\ntimescales. The pseudo-reconstructions demonstrate that the\nearly 19th-century discrepancy between reconstructed and simulated PNA\ndoes not stem from the reconstruction process. Instead, reconstructed and\nsimulated features of the early 19th-century PNA can be reconciled by\ninterpreting the reconstructed evolution during this time as an expression\nof internal climate variability, which is unlikely to be reproduced in its\nexact temporal occurrence by a small ensemble of climate simulations.\nHowever, firm attribution of the reconstructed PNA anomaly is hampered by\nknown limitations and deficiencies of coupled climate models and\nuncertainties in the early 19th-century external forcing and background\nclimate state.",

J. Burns, L. C. Kanner, H. Cheng, and R. Lawrence Edwards<br /><br />Relatively few marine or terrestrial paleoclimate studies have focused on\nglacial inception, the transition from an interglacial to a glacial climate\nstate. As a result, neither the timing and structure of glacial inception nor the spatial pattern of glacial inception in different parts of\nthe world is well known. Here we present results of a study of a speleothem from the\nPeruvian Andes that records changes in the intensity of South American Summer\nMonsoon (SASM) rainfall over the period from 125 to 115 ka. The results show\nthat late in the last interglacial period, at 123 ka, SASM rainfall\ndecreased, perhaps in response to a decrease in temperature and ice cover in\nthe high northern latitudes and associated changes in atmospheric\ncirculation. Then at 120.8 ka, a rapid increase in SASM rainfall marks the\nend of the last interglacial. After a more gradual increase between 120 and\n117 ka, a second abrupt increase occurs at 117 ka. This pattern of change\nis mirrored to a remarkable degree by changes in the East Asian Monsoon. It\nis interpreted to reflect both a long-term gradual response of the monsoons\nto orbitally driven insolation changes and to rapid changes in Northern\nHemisphere ice volume and temperature. Both monsoon systems are close to\ntheir full glacial conditions by 117 ka, before any significant decrease in\natmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.",

It has been suggested, for\ninstance, that the Brazil Current (BC) would strengthen (weaken) and the\nNorth Brazil Current (NBC) would weaken (strengthen) during slowdown\n(speed-up) events of the AMOC. This anti-phase pattern was claimed to be a\nnecessary response to the decreased North Atlantic heat piracy during periods\nof weak AMOC. However, the thermal evolution of the western South Atlantic\nand the adjacent continent is so far largely unknown. Here we address this\nissue, presenting high-temporal-resolution SST and MAT records from the BC\nand southeastern South America, respectively. We identify a warming in the\nwestern South Atlantic during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), which is followed\nfirst by a drop and then by increasing temperatures during the\nB\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d, in phase with an existing SST record from the NBC.\nAdditionally, a similar SST evolution is shown by a southernmost eastern\nSouth Atlantic record, suggesting a South Atlantic-wide pattern in SST\nevolution during most of Termination 1. Over southeastern South America, our\nMAT record shows a two-step increase during Termination 1, synchronous with\natmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise (i.e., during the second half of HS1 and during the\nYounger Dryas), and lagging abrupt SST changes by several thousand years.\nThis delay corroborates the notion that the long duration of HS1 was\nfundamental in driving the Earth out of the last glacial.",

Microthermometric\n      measurements of fluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures allow\n      determination of stalagmite formation temperatures by measuring the\n      radius of stable laser-induced vapour bubbles inside the\n      inclusions. A reliable method for precisely measuring the radius of\n      vapour bubbles is presented. The method is applied to stalagmite\n      samples for which the formation temperature is known. An assessment of\n      the bubble radius measurement accuracy and how this error influences\n      the uncertainty in determining the formation temperature is\n      provided. We demonstrate that the nominal homogenisation temperature\n      of a single inclusion can be determined with an accuracy of\n      \u00b10.25 \u00b0C, if the volume of the inclusion is larger\n      than 10<sup>5</sup> \u03bcm<sup>3</sup>. With this method, we could measure in a\n      proof-of-principle investigation that the formation temperature of\n      10\u201320 yr\n      old inclusions in a stalagmite taken from the Milandre cave is 9.87 \u00b1 0.80 \u00b0C,\n      while the mean annual surface temperature, that in the case of the Milandre cave correlates\n      well with the cave temperature, was 9.6 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b0C, calculated from actual\n      measurements at that time, showing a very good agreement. Formation temperatures of\n      inclusions formed during the last 450 yr are found in a temperature range between\n      8.4 and 9.6 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the calculated average surface temperature.

Sun<br /><br />Mineral dust plays\n  an important role in the climate system by interacting\nwith radiation, clouds, and biogeochemical cycles. In addition, natural\narchives show that the dust cycle experienced variability in the past in\nresponse to global and local climate change. The compilation of the DIRTMAP (Dust Indicators and Records from\nTerrestrial and MArine Palaeoenvironments) paleodust data sets in the last 2 decades provided a benchmark for paleoclimate\nmodels that include the dust cycle, following a time slice approach. We\npropose an innovative framework to organize a paleodust data set that builds on the positive experience of DIRTMAP and takes into account new scientific\nchallenges by providing a concise and accessible data set of temporally\nresolved records of dust mass accumulation rates and particle grain size\ndistributions. We consider data from ice cores, marine sediments,\nloess\u2013paleosol sequences, lake sediments, and peat bogs for this compilation,\nwith a temporal focus on the Holocene period. This global compilation allows\nthe investigation of the potential, uncertainties, and confidence level of dust\nmass accumulation rate reconstructions and highlights the importance of\ndust particle size information for accurate and quantitative reconstructions\nof the dust cycle. After applying criteria that help to establish that the\ndata considered represent changes in dust deposition, 45 paleodust records\nhave been identified, with the highest density of dust deposition data\noccurring in the North Atlantic region. Although the temporal evolution of\ndust in the North Atlantic appears consistent across several cores and\nsuggests that minimum dust fluxes are likely observed during the early to\nmid-Holocene period (6000\u20138000 years ago), the magnitude of dust fluxes in\nthese observations is not fully consistent, suggesting that more work needs\nto be done to synthesize data sets for the Holocene.

Tachikawa, L. Vidal, M. Cornuault, M. Garcia, A. Pothin, C. Sonzogni, E. Bard, G. Menot, and M. Revel<br /><br />Holocene eastern Mediterranean Sea sediments contain an organic-rich sapropel\nS1 layer that was formed in oxygen-depleted waters. The spatial distribution\nof this layer revealed that during S1 deposition, deep waters were anoxic\nbelow a depth of 1800 m. However, whether this boundary permanently existed\nfrom the early to the mid-Holocene has not been examined yet. To answer this\nquestion, a multi-proxy approach was applied to a core retrieved close to the\n1800 m boundary (at 1780 m). We measured the bulk sediment elemental\ncomposition, the stable isotopic composition of the planktonic foraminifer\n<i>Globigerinoides ruber</i> and the abundance of benthic foraminifera\nsince the last deglaciation. The result indicates that authigenic U and Mo\naccumulation began around 13\u201312 cal ka BP, in concert with surface water\nfreshening estimated from the <i>G. ruber</i> \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O record. The\nonset of bottom and pore water oxygen depletion occurred prior to S1\ndeposition inferred from barium enrichment. In the middle of the S1\ndeposition period, reduced authigenic V, Fe and As contents and the\nBr/Cl ratio indicated short-term bottom-water re-oxygenation. A sharp\nMn peak and maximal abundance for benthic foraminifera marked a total\nrecovery for circulation at approximately 7 cal ka BP. Based on our\nresults and existing data, we suggest that S1 formation within the upper\n1780 m of the eastern Mediterranean Sea was preconditioned by reduced\nventilation, resulting from excess freshwater inputs due to insolation\nchanges under deglacial conditions that initiated between 15 and\n12 cal ka BP within the upper\n1780 m. Short-term re-oxygenation in the Levantine Basin is estimated to\nhave affected bottom water at least as deep as 1780 m in response to cooling\nand/or the reduction of freshwater inputs. We tentatively propose that\ncomplete ventilation recovery at the S1 termination was depth-dependent, with\nearlier oxygenation within the upper 1780 m. Our results provide new\nconstraints on vertical water column structure in the eastern Mediterranean\nSea since the last deglaciation.",

Iriarte<br /><br />Cerr\u00e3do savannas have the greatest fire activity of all major global land-cover\ntypes and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. During the\n21st century, temperatures are projected to increase by ~ 3 \u00b0C coupled with a precipitation decrease of\n~ 20%. Although these conditions could potentially\nintensify drought stress, it is unknown how that might alter vegetation\ncomposition and fire regimes. To assess how Neotropical savannas responded\nto past climate changes, a 14 500-year, high-resolution, sedimentary record\nfrom Huanchaca Mesetta, a palm swamp located in the cerr\u00e3do savanna in northeastern\nBolivia, was analyzed with phytoliths, stable isotopes, and charcoal. A\nnon-analogue, cold-adapted vegetation community dominated the\nLateglacial\u2013early Holocene period (14 500\u20139000 cal yr BP, which included trees and\nC<sub>3</sub> Pooideae and C<sub>4</sub> Panicoideae grasses. The Lateglacial\nvegetation was fire-sensitive and fire activity during this period was low,\nlikely responding to fuel availability and limitation. Although similar\nvegetation characterized the early Holocene, the warming conditions\nassociated with the onset of the Holocene led to an initial increase in fire\nactivity. Huanchaca Mesetta became increasingly fire-dependent during the\nmiddle Holocene with the expansion of C<sub>4</sub> fire-adapted grasses. However,\nas warm, dry conditions, characterized by increased length and severity of\nthe dry season, continued, fuel availability decreased. The establishment of\nthe modern palm swamp vegetation occurred at 5000 cal yr BP. Edaphic factors\nare the first-order control on vegetation on the rocky quartzite mesetta.\nWhere soils are sufficiently thick, climate is the second-order control of\nvegetation on the mesetta. The presence of the modern palm swamp is\nattributed to two factors: (1) increased precipitation that increased water\ntable levels and (2) decreased frequency and duration of <i>surazos</i> (cold wind\nincursions from Patagonia) leading to increased temperature minima. Natural\n(soil, climate, fire) drivers rather than anthropogenic drivers control the\nvegetation and fire activity at Huanchaca Mesetta. Thus the cerr\u00e3do savanna\necosystem of the Huanchaca Plateau has exhibited ecosystem resilience to\nmajor climatic changes in both temperature and precipitation since the\nLateglacial period.",

A new\nregional Mg / Ca calibration for the benthic foraminifera <i>Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi</i> (type B) was\nestablished to convert the benthic Mg / Ca value to BWT, based on 26\nsurface sediment samples and two core-top samples retrieved around Okinawa\nIsland. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub>\nin the intermediate water in the northwestern South Pacific was ~0.4&permil; lower than in the deep South Pacific, indicating a greater\nvertical salinity gradient than at present. This salinity (and probably density)\nstructure would have led to stratification in the intermediate and deep\nPacific, which would, in turn, have greatly influenced carbon storage during\nthe glacial time. The benthic Mg / Ca and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub> records suggest changes\nthat seem to follow Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the B\u00f8lling\u2013Alle\u00f8d\n(B/A) and Younger Dryas (YD) intervals, with BWT higher during H1\n(~17 kyr BP) and YD (~12 kyr BP) and lower\nduring B/A (~14 kyr BP). The warming in the bottom water\nduring H1 suggests increased contribution of North Pacific Intermediate\nWater (NPIW) to the subtropical northwestern Pacific and decreased upwelling\nof cooler waters from the abyssal North Pacific. During the interval from 17\nto 14.5 kyr BP, the BWT tended to decrease successively in association with\na decrease in \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C values, presumably as a result of increased\nupwelling of the abyssal waters to the intermediate depths of the North\nPacific caused by shoaling and enhancement of the southward return flow\nof Pacific Deep Water (PDW). During the Holocene, the millennial- to sub-millennial-scale variations in the BWT generally correlate with the sea\nsurface temperatures in the Okhotsk Sea, the source region of the NPIW,\nsuggesting that changes in the BWT are linked to changes in the NPIW\nproduction rate.",

However, scarce decadal and seasonally\nresolved speleothem records are often difficult to interpret in terms of\nclimate due to the multitude of factors that affect the proxy signals. In\nthis paper, a fast-growing (up to 2 mm yr<sup>\u22121</sup>) seasonally laminated speleothem\nfrom the Han-sur-Lesse cave (Belgium) is analyzed for its \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O\nand \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C values, layer thickness and changes in calcite aspect.\nThe studied record covers the period between AD 2001 and 1479 as indicated\nby layer counting and confirmed by 20 U / Th ages. The Proserpine proxies are\nseasonally biased and document drier (and colder) winters on multidecadal\nscales. Higher \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C signals reflect increased prior calcite\nprecipitation (PCP) and lower soil activity during drier (and colder)\nwinters. Thinner layers and darker calcite relate to slower growth and exist\nduring drier (and colder) winter periods. Exceptionally dry (and cold)\nwinter periods occur from 1565 to 1610, at 1730, from 1770 to 1800, from\n1810 to 1860, and from 1880 to 1895 and correspond to exceptionally cold\nperiods in historical and instrumental records as well as European winter\ntemperature reconstructions. More relative climate variations, during which\nthe four measured proxies vary independently and display lower amplitude\nvariations, occur between 1479 and 1565, between 1610 and 1730, and between\n1730 and 1770. The winters during the first and last periods are interpreted\nas relatively wetter (and warmer) and correspond to warmer periods in\nhistorical data and in winter temperature reconstructions in Europe. The\nwinters in the period between 1610 and 1730 are interpreted as relatively\ndrier (and cooler) and correspond to generally colder conditions in\nEurope. Interpretation of the seasonal variations in \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O and\n\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C signals differs from that on a decadal and multidecadal\nscale. Seasonal \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O variations reflect cave air temperature\nvariations and suggest a 2.5 \u00b0C seasonality in cave air\ntemperature during the two relatively wetter (and warmer) winter periods\n(1479\u20131565 and 1730\u20131770), which corresponds to the cave air temperature\nseasonality observed today. Between 1610 and 1730, the \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O\nvalues suggest a 1.5 \u00b0C seasonality in cave air temperature,\nindicating colder summer temperatures during this drier (and cooler)\ninterval. The \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C seasonality is driven by PCP and suggests\ngenerally lower PCP seasonal effects between 1479 and 1810 compared to\ntoday. A short interval of increased PCP seasonality occurs between 1600 and\n1660, and reflects increased PCP in summer due to decreased winter recharge.",

For other regions changes in fuel moisture are more\nimportant for the overall trend in fire activity (North America, Sub-Saharan\nAfrica, Europe, Asia monsoon).

Polar ice\n      cores provide unique information about deposition of aeolian dust\n      particles transported over long distances. These cores are\n      a palaeoclimate proxy archive of climate variability thousands of years\n      ago.  The current study is a first attempt to simulate past\n      interglacial dust cycles with a global aerosol\u2013climate model\n      ECHAM5-HAM.  The results are used to explain the dust deposition\n      changes in Antarctica in terms of quantitative contribution of\n      different processes, such as emission, atmospheric transport and\n      precipitation, which will help to interpret palaeodata from Antarctic\n      ice cores. The investigated periods include four interglacial\n      time slices: the pre-industrial control (CTRL), mid-Holocene\n      (6000 yr BP; hereafter referred to as \"6 kyr\"), last glacial inception (115 000 yr BP; hereafter \"115 kyr\")\n      and Eemian (126 000 yr BP; hereafter \"126 kyr\"). One glacial time interval,\n      the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (21 000 yr BP; hereafter \"21 kyr\"), was simulated as\n      well to be a reference test for the model.  Results suggest an increase\n      in mineral dust deposition globally, and in Antarctica, in the past\n      interglacial periods relative to the pre-industrial CTRL\n      simulation. Approximately two-thirds of the increase in the\n      mid-Holocene and Eemian is attributed to enhanced Southern Hemisphere\n      dust emissions.  Slightly strengthened transport efficiency causes the\n      remaining one-third of the increase in dust deposition.  The moderate\n      change in dust deposition in Antarctica in the last glacial inception\n      period is caused by the slightly stronger poleward atmospheric\n      transport efficiency compared to the pre-industrial.  Maximum dust\n      deposition in Antarctica was simulated for the glacial period. LGM\n      dust deposition in Antarctica is substantially increased due to 2.6\n      times higher Southern Hemisphere dust emissions, 2 times stronger\n      atmospheric transport towards Antarctica, and 30% weaker\n      precipitation over the Southern Ocean.  The model is able to reproduce\n      the order of magnitude of dust deposition globally and in Antarctica\n      for the pre-industrial and LGM climates.",

Therefore,\naccurate reconstructions of past vegetation and hydrological changes are\ncrucial for a better understanding of climate variability in the tropical\nsoutheastern African region. We present high-resolution pollen records from\na marine sediment core recovered offshore of the Rufiji River delta. Our data\ndocument significant shifts in pollen assemblages during the last\ndeglaciation, identifying, through changes in both upland and\nlowland vegetation, specific responses of plant communities to atmospheric\n(precipitation) and coastal (coastal dynamics and sea-level changes)\nalterations. Specifically, arid conditions reflected by a maximum pollen\nrepresentation of dry and open vegetation occurred during the Northern\nHemisphere cold Heinrich event 1 (H1), suggesting that the expansion of drier\nupland vegetation was synchronous with cold Northern Hemisphere\nconditions. This arid period is followed by an interval in which forest and\nhumid woodlands expanded, indicating a hydrologic shift towards more humid\nconditions. Droughts during H1 and the shift to humid conditions around 14.8 kyr BP in the uplands are consistent with latitudinal shifts of the\nintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude Northern\nHemisphere climatic fluctuations. Additionally, our results show that the\nlowland vegetation, consisting of well-developed salt marshes and mangroves\nin a successional pattern typical for vegetation occurring in intertidal\nhabitats, has responded mainly to local coastal dynamics related to marine\ninundation frequencies and soil salinity in the Rufiji Delta as well as to the\nlocal moisture availability. Lowland vegetation shows a substantial\nexpansion of mangrove trees after ~ 14.8 kyr BP, suggesting an\nincreased moisture availability and river runoff in the coastal area. The\nresults of this study highlight the decoupled climatic and environmental\nprocesses to which the vegetation in the uplands and the Rufiji Delta has\nresponded during the last deglaciation.",

The Southeast Asian sea regional sea level trends are some of the highest observed\nin the modern satellite altimeter record that now spans almost 2 decades.\nInitial comparisons of global sea level reconstructions find that 17-year\nsea level trends over the past 60 years exhibit good agreement with decadal\nvariability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and related\nfluctuations of trade winds in the region. The Southeast Asian sea region exhibits sea\nlevel trends that vary dramatically over the studied time period. This\nhistorical variation suggests that the strong regional sea level trends\nobserved during the modern satellite altimeter record will abate as trade\nwinds fluctuate on decadal and longer timescales. Furthermore, after\nremoving the contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to sea level trends in the past\n20 years, the rate of sea level rise is greatly reduced in the Southeast Asian sea region. As\na result of the influence of the PDO, the Southeast Asian sea regional sea level trends\nduring the 2010s and 2020s are likely to be less than the global mean sea level\n(GMSL) trend if the observed oscillations in wind forcing and sea level\npersist.
