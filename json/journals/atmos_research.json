The comparisons were carried out at the annual, monthly and daily time steps. All SREs reproduce the salient pattern of the annual rain field, with a marked north\u2013south gradient and a lighter east\u2013west gradient. However, the intensity of the gradient differs among SREs: it is well marked in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 (TMPA-3B42), Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) products, and it is smoothed out in the Climate prediction center MORPHing (CMORPH) products. Another interesting difference among products is the contrast in rainfall amounts between the water surfaces (Lake Titicaca) and the surrounding land. Some products (TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and GSMaP) show a contradictory rainfall deficit over Lake Titicaca, which may be due to the emissivity contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands and warm rain cloud processes. An analysis differentiating coastal Lake Titicaca from inland pixels confirmed this trend. The raw or Real Time (RT) products have strong biases over the study region. These biases are strongly positive for PERSIANN (above 90%), moderately positive for TMPA-3B42 (28%), strongly negative for CMORPH (\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>42%) and moderately negative for GSMaP (\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>18%). The biases are associated with a deformation of the rain rate frequency distribution: GSMaP underestimates the proportion of rainfall events for all rain rates; CMORPH overestimates the proportion of rain rates below 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm day<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>; and the other products tend to overestimate the proportion of moderate to high rain rates. These biases are greatly reduced by the gauge adjustment in the TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and CMORPH products, whereas a negative bias becomes positive for GSMaP. TMPA-3B42 Adjusted (Adj) version 7 demonstrates the best overall agreement with gauges in terms of correlation, rain rate distribution and bias. However, PERSIANN-Adj's bias in the southern part of the domain is very low.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A PLR rate is an important variable for the snowmelt runoff models. In a mountainous region, the PLR could be varied from lower elevation parts to high elevation parts. In this study, a PLR was computed by accounting elevation differences, which varies from around 1500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m to 7000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. A precipitation variability and extremity were analysed using multiple mathematical functions viz. quantile regression, spatial mean, spatial standard deviation, Mann\u2013Kendall test and Sen's estimation. For this reason, a daily precipitation, in the historical (years 1980\u20132005) as measured/observed gridded points and projected experiments for the 21st century (years 2006\u20132100) simulated by CMIP5 ESM-2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>M model (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Earth System Model 2) employing three different radiative forcing scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways), utilized for the research work. The outcomes of this study suggest that a PLR is significantly varied from lower elevation to high elevation parts. The PEI based analysis showed that the extreme high intensity events have been increased significantly, especially after 2040s. The PEI based observations also showed that the numbers of wet days are increased for all the RCPs. The quantile regression plots showed significant increments in the upper and lower quantiles of the various extreme indices. The Mann\u2013Kendall test and Sen's estimation tests clearly indicated significant changing patterns in the frequency and intensity of the precipitation indices across all the sub-basins and RCP scenario in an intra-decadal time series domain.

However, there is still large uncertainty about the rate of longwave cooling at the cloud top in recent numerical models. Radiative transfer calculations within stratocumulus clouds can be further improved by using bin scheme in the calculation of longwave extinction coefficients.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">A method to calculate bin optical properties was developed and was implemented in the RRTM LW radiative transfer model. This bin-type radiation scheme allows us more accurate calculation of the optical properties of clouds, because it does not need any arbitrary assumption for the size distribution of the hydrometeors. The number concentrations and mixing ratios in 36 size-bins provided by bin microphysical scheme are used for calculation of the extinction coefficient. In this paper results of this new scheme were compared to that of one-moment and two-moment bulk radiation schemes where the size distributions were supposed to follow a gamma-function. It was found that the application of the two-moment bulk scheme had no advantage against the one-moment bulk scheme in simulation of radiation profiles, if radiation feedback on cloud processes was not taken into account. Although the gamma function used by bulk schemes fitted relatively well to the size distribution of the water drops calculated by the bin scheme, the longwave radiation fluxes calculated by the two schemes (bulk vs. bin) were significantly different. The bin radiation scheme gave at least 50% larger warming rates both at the cloud base and at the cloud top than the bulk schemes did. The cooling/warming occurred in a thinner vertical layer in the case of the bin scheme than in the case of bulk schemes. The shape of the net radiation profile strongly depended on the CCN concentration. Continental clouds were found to have horizontally less varying value and vertically thinner region of cloud top cooling than maritime clouds.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">Compared with the observations the bulk radiation schemes failed to simulate the cloud base warming, while the bin radiation scheme reproduced well the observed cloud base warming.

Samplings were performed in the framework of the 27th Italian Antarctica expedition of the Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica in the period 21 February\u20136 August 2012. Events of clear-sky precipitations and precipitations from clouds were considered and the replicas obtained were examined under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Several shapes of ice crystals were identified, including \u201cdiamond dust\u201d (plates, pyramids, hollow and solid columns), and crystal aggregates varying in complexity. Single events often contained both small (10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcm to 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcm) and large (hundreds of microns) crystals, suggesting that crystals can form simultaneously near the ground (height of a few hundred metres) and at higher layers (height of thousands of metres). Images of sampled crystal replicas showed that single bullets are not produced separately, but by the disintegration of combinations of bullets. Rimed ice crystals were absent in the Dome C samples, i.e. the only mode of crystal growth was water vapour diffusion. On considering the aerosol in the sampled crystals, we reached the conclusion that inertial impaction, interception and Brownian motion were insufficient to explain the scavenged aerosol. We therefore presume that phoretic forces play a role in scavenging during the crystal growth process.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The total of 4,952,203 cloud-to-ground flashes (2082<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days with thunderstorms) derived from the PERUN lightning database, and 12,419 daily thunderstorm SYNOP reports from 44 meteorological stations (1417<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days with thunderstorms) are compared. Within the use of two different computational methods, we define the threshold value of the human average observational thunderstorm detection range within a meteorological station.

Hurricane Irene, occurring in August 2011, is an excellent case study for investigating aerosol effects on tropical cyclone (TC) structure and intensity: it moved northward along the eastern coast of the United States, and weakened much faster than was predicted by the National Hurricane Center. Moreover, the minimum pressure in Irene occurred, atypically, about 40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>h later than the time of maximum wind speed. In this study, we simulate Hurricane Irene with 1-km grid spacing using Spectral Bin Microphysics (SBM) and various bulk microphysical schemes in WRF. Simulations with SBM showed that aerosols penetrating the eyewall of Irene from the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) led to an intensification of convection at Irene's eyewall and to a deepening of the hurricane. When Irene moved along the eastern coast of the United States, continental aerosols led to an intensification of convection at Irene's periphery, which interfered with the re-forming of the inner eyewall and to Irene weakening. Sensitivity tests using different \u201cbulk\u201d microphysics schemes indicated a large dispersion of simulated minimum pressure and maximum wind between different simulations. This showed that the simulated hurricane intensity was very sensitive to microphysical processes. Moreover, in consequence, forecast hurricane intensity was highly dependent on the choice of microphysical scheme. New bulk-parameterization schemes simulated the tropical storm intensity of Irene reasonably well. Most bulk schemes that used saturation adjustment indicate the weak sensitivity to aerosols that prevents them from precisely predicting the time evolution of TC intensity and structure.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A simple analytical formulation is then derived, which only needs cloud coverage, wind velocity, air and dew point temperature data to be collected, at least once in a day before sunrise. The formulation is tested in several places in the world with different climates. Agreement within typically 30% is found with dew measurements.

Besides temperature and precipitation, utilized variables are relative humidity, boundary layer height, shortwave radiation, wind speed, convective and large-scale precipitation in view of explaining some of the biases. Furthermore, the forecast skill of evapotranspiration and irrigation water need is ultimately assessed. It is found that the modelled temperature exhibits a small but significant negative bias during the cold period in the snow-covered northeast regions. Total precipitation exhibits positive bias during all seasons but autumn, peaking in the spring months. The varying physics configurations resulted in significant differences for the simulated minimum temperature, summer rainfall, relative humidity, solar radiation and planetary boundary layer height. The interaction of the temperature and moisture profiles with the different microphysics schemes, results in excess convective precipitation using MYJ/WSM6 compared to YSU/Thompson. With respect to evapotranspiration and irrigation need, the errors using the MYJ configuration were in opposite directions and eventually cancel out, producing overall smaller biases. WRF was able to dynamically downscale global forecast data into finer resolutions in space and time for hydro-meteorological applications such as the irrigation management.

A climatological perspective is first presented on classifying significant tornadoes in Bangladesh, noting the challenges since reports of tornadoes are not documented in a formal manner. The statistical relationship between United States and Bangladesh tornado-related deaths suggests that significant tornadoes do occur in Bangladesh so this paper identifies the most significant tornadic events and analyzes the environmental conditions associated with these events. Given the scarcity of observational data to assess the near-storm environment in this region, high-resolution (3-km horizontal grid spacing) numerical weather prediction simulations are performed for events identified to be associated with a significant tornado. In comparison to similar events over the United States, significant tornado environments in Bangladesh are characterized by relatively high convective available potential energy, sufficient deep-layer vertical shear, and a propensity for deviant (i.e., well to the right of the mean flow) storm motion along a low-level convergence boundary.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

With respect to the last, a major issue is the difficulty to attain a correct representation of soil moisture due to the lack of a measurement network established.

One alternative is the information given by the Land Surface Models (LSM), for example those provided by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS).</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Our main concern is to investigate the sensitivity of short-term numerical weather prediction to soil moisture initializations. The analysis is focused in precipitation mainly to the second forecast day, and other variables related to the atmospheric water balance. To accomplish this, we perform five experiments including some of the GLDAS databases (NOAH, VIC and MOSAIC) in the initialization of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, during a test period of one month (March 2009). An initial field normalization procedure using one of the soil models as reference is also evaluated.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">We show that the ambiguity of the soil models, given by their spatial and temporal variability as well as the forcing atmospheric fields, is transferred to the weather prediction model coupling, all over the month considered.

With respect to the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) calculated for the same variable, we find that the values are generally low. In addition, the mean values of each statistic measure (NBIAS, BIAS, NRMSE and RMSE) do not show significant differences among the experiments (at 99% of significance). Nonetheless, it was shown that using the MOSAIC LSM for the initial conditions leads to minor NRMSE and RMSE maximums. Finally, while analyzing both moisture fluxes and precipitable water at different periods of the month, we find sensitive areas where the impact is mostly important, as Southeastern South America, central Argentina and Northeastern Brazil.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A set of severe hydrometeorological episodes affected various basins across south and eastern Mediterranean Spain from 27 to 29 September 2012. Flooding was particularly catastrophic in Andalusia and Murcia, where 10 fatalities occurred and material losses were estimated at 120<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>M\u20ac. The predictability bounds set by the type and scales of the processes involved in such high-impact episodes require the explicit representation of uncertainty in the hydrometeorological forecasting chain. A short-range ensemble prediction system (EPS) provides the optimal framework to generate risk-based forecasts supporting valuable early warning procedures and mitigation measures. We explore the potential of this probabilistic forecasting approach on the 28 September 2012 flash flood in the Guadalent\u00edn river basin, a medium-sized catchment located in Murcia, southeastern Spain. After a rigorous calibration with rain-gauge data, the hydrological response of the basin to this flooding is accurately simulated by the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrological Modeling System runoff model. Then, we explore the uncertainty transference from a collection of mesoscale meteorological deterministic and probabilistic 48<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>h predictions provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The meteorological simulations are nested within the global EPS of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, therefore inheriting the spread of the global system and providing probabilistic high-resolution precipitation structures to the hydrological model. By assuming the calibrated model as a good representation of a perfect hydrological model for this event, it becomes an advanced and user-oriented verification tool for quantitative precipitation forecasts. Results highlight the benefits of accounting for uncertainties in the precipitation forecasts and the value of the proposed set-up for the short-range prediction of quantitative discharge forecasts. The warn-on-forecast approach is shown to be possible within a probabilistic hydrometeorological forecasting chain for basins as small and fast-responsive as the Guadalent\u00edn basin, proving to be suitable for civil protection warning procedures.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate the rainstorm under the background of binary typhoons of Fitow and Danas. Three sensitivity experiments of typhoon intensity changes of binary typhoons were carried out. It was found that the Typhoon Danas was the main factor in this torrential rain event, in which its accompanied strong eastward low-level jet was the major moisture conveyor belt through which the warm and moist air was brought into the heavy rainfall zone and the static instability was maintained and enhanced over the YRD. The convergence line formed by periphery easterly flow of Typhoon Danas and southward cold air, together with the local frontogenesis mainly due to convergence, was an important trigger factor of this rainstorm. The large scale forcing was the major uplift mechanism, and the underlying frontal uplift played a secondary role for rainstorm in the north YRD, while uplift mechanism for rainstorm in the southern YRD is mainly local underlying frontal uplift induced large CAPE release resulting in local strong buoyancy uplift that led to strong upward motion. Not only did the convergence of twin typhoons directly provide dynamic conditions for the rainstorm, but also the dynamic lifting was enhanced by binary typhoons through strengthening the coupling of upper-level and low-level jet. The sensitivity tests revealed that the rainstorm in YRD was sensitive to both typhoons' intensity, and the rainfall in the south YRD was more sensitive than that in the north. A conceptual model of YRD rainstorm under binary typhoon situation was proposed based on the above-mentioned factors.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

For the collection of total suspended particulate matter (TSP), a filter unit low volume sampler (LVS) was employed. One hundred and seventeen samples were collected during 2010, 2011, and 2012, both on weekdays and weekends at a monitoring station located in Draria city, a suburban site near Algiers, Algeria. The concentrations of 25 trace elements (As, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Gd, Hf, K, La, Mn, Mo, Na, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sr, V, and Zn) were determined by INAA using short and long neutron irradiation technique. Generally lower concentration values were observed during the weekends compared to the weekdays for almost all elements. The mean TSP concentration (34.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcg/m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>) showed a seasonal pattern with higher levels during summer. The weekday/weekend ratio of TSP was 1.3 higher during summer than in winter. The concentrations of the elements Sb, Se, and Cd are found to be highly enriched in atmospheric particulate matter. According to their high enrichment factors (EFs), it was possible to establish that these elements are of anthropogenic origin coming from automobile exhausts which is the main source of emission in this area. The typical suburban background TSP and trace element levels were compared with literature data from other regions around the world, and were lower than those reported in an urban site in Algiers in a previous study.

Here, new sets of A\u2013P coefficient values over Spain for the selected stations are provided. Moreover, the impact of both time bases on the A\u2013P performance is analysed concluding that the A\u2013P obtained coefficients can be permutated between daily and monthly mean daily time bases.

We found that the formation of SOA is significant when the WSOC/OC ratio is larger than 0.40.

Two typical wood fuels in the Iberian Peninsula were tested: pine (<italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>), a softwood, and beech (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>), a hardwood. PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> samples were analysed for organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), levoglucosan and 56 elements.

The carbonaceous component of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> was dominated by OC. The OC content of PM<inf loc=\"post\">10</inf> was higher when higher loads were fed into the combustion chamber, for both fuels.

Six light and common (C<inf loc=\"post\">1</inf>\u2013C<inf loc=\"post\">5</inf>) aldehydes (i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, i-valeraldehyde, and valeraldehyde) out of a large member of carbonyl compounds were selected in this research.

Based on the daily precipitation data at 134 stations between 1961 and 2013, this paper analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of the dry and wet conditions in the Huai River Basin through the statistical analysis of the rainfall stations' annual and seasonal standard precipitation index (SPI) series. Annual SPI series exhibited a decreasing trend at 86 stations and an increasing trend at the remaining stations. None of the increasing trend was significant, while the decreasing trend was significant at two stations at 5% significance level (\u03b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) and one station at 10% level. Seasonal-wise, there has been a prevailing trend of drying in spring and autumn, and wetting in summer and winter. The trends in the spring and summer SPI series have been mostly insignificant, while those in autumn and winter, significant (\u03b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.10) at over 30 stations. The Pettitt test results indicated that the significant transitions (\u03b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.10) in the autumn and winter SPI series mostly occurred in the middle to late 1980s. Comparison of the average number of dry and wet years between the two sub-periods of 1961\u20131984 and 1990\u20132013 suggested a significant increase (\u03b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) in the average number of severely wet years across much of the basin.

Specifically, Sandy generated record low-pressure, a large wind field with corresponding storm surge and copious amounts of precipitation in some areas, including record snowfall in mountainous regions. Sandy presented several forecast challenges to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS). Satellites played an integral role in the analysis and forecast of Sandy's track and intensity. The NOAA National Hurricane Center, Ocean Prediction Center, and Weather Prediction Center all relied on information from satellites to make critical warning decisions using various satellite products that assist with diagnosing tropical cyclone intensity, surface winds over the ocean, and heavy precipitation. All of the skillful global forecast models used satellite data for initiation to better forecast the track and intensity of Sandy. As part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite \u2014 R-series (GOES-R) and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Proving Ground activities, new satellite products were available to forecasters at these national centers in experimental form to assist with observing this unique, high impact event. This paper will demonstrate how the current satellite products assisted NOAA forecasters during Sandy and introduce some new satellite products that could be used to analyze and predict future high impact weather systems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Based on the best available information we show that our planet continues to be out of balance with additional heat being added to it at the rate of 0.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Wm<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2</sup>. This heat appears to be taken up primarily by the oceans of the SH and perhaps mostly equatorward of 37<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>S. The nature of the adjustments applied to our best estimates of individual, annual mean fluxes of energy to produce a balance are described and the results of applying a more formal constraint for these adjustments are discussed. The energy balances of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres are then shown to be practically identical which in turn suggests the transport of energy across the equator in the net is close to zero. In fact the hemispheres are not identically symmetrical with the SH being slightly out of balance absorbing the additional heat and transporting a small amount of net heat across the equator to the balanced NH. The symmetry in absorbed solar and the near symmetry in OLR are remarkable in their own right and are a result of the effects of clouds both on solar reflection and OLR that act to offset land\u2013ocean interhemispheric differences. We then demonstrate important interhemispheric seasonal influences on the heat transported to the winter pole that conspire to make these seasonal transports lopsided. This asymmetry is a direct result of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit that induces larger energy losses from the southern winter hemisphere. This in turn produces a latitudinal asymmetry in the location of on the tropical trough zone, a region from which energy is always moved to the winter pole, requiring it be located deeper into the NH.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The study is based on the use of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity data retrieved from ZEUS system, operated by the National Observatory of Athens, and examines the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of the lightning activity. The effect of elevation, terrain slope, vegetation cover and convective available potential energy (CAPE) on the distribution of the CG lightning strokes is also investigated. Lightning is modulated by the diurnal cycle of insolation and the underlying topographic features of the region. The lightning strokes are more numerous over the mainland than over the sea. CG lightning activity is dominant over the land and the coastal areas during spring and summer while during the coldest period of the year it is dominant over the sea.

The relationship of different types of land use and soil (thirteen categories of land use and fourteen major soil types were considered) on cloud-to-ground lightning activity was studied in the Spanish region of Castilla-Le\u00f3n from 2000 to 2010. To do this, urban, mining, and industrial areas were found to be associated with enhanced CG-lightning activity. With respect to natural land uses, forest and shrubland were the categories where CG-lightning was seen to be increased. By contrast, non-agricultural vegetated areas and pastures displayed the lowest CG-lightning activity. When the major soil types are considered, rendzinas, podzols, and phaeozems were found to be associated with a slight increase in CG-lightning activity and gleysols and solonchaks seem to decrease it. Assuming there are a plethora of factors which can indirectly affect the charging electromicrophysics and cloud dynamics, the authors provide evidence that soil type shows a significant correlation on CG-lightning flash density and weather characteristics are affected by land uses. It is suggested that the influence of vegetation and soil on surface moisture is one of the main effects contributing to explain the impact of land cover on CG-lightning.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The experimental setup and main parameters of the L625 lidar for water vapor measurement are first presented, then the measurement principle of water vapor and data processing methods are introduced. The water vapor measurement precision of the lidar system was analyzed by comparison with radiosonde. Monthly and seasonal water vapor profiles were built by analyzing 2000\u20132008 lidar data. In the vertical direction, results show that water vapor content decreases gradually with height. The more the water vapor content in the low atmosphere, the faster the decay rate with altitude. As far as monthly variation, the water vapor content first increases and then decreases with month. The maximum content of water vapor appears in July, at mixing ratio of 15.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g/kg at 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km. The seasonal variability of water vapor content is rather obvious. In summer the water vapor mixing ratio reaches up to 15.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g/kg at 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km, and in winter it is only 3.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g/kg at the same altitude. Interannual variation of water vapor content differs between seasons (as revealed in the standard deviation of data) where summer is least stable and autumn is the most stable. Precipitable water vapor is calculated from water vapor mean profiles at 1\u20134<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km and the relationship between precipitable water vapor and precipitation is also investigated. A clear positive correlation is found with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) 0.933 between monthly precipitation and mean precipitable water vapor, as well a clear positive correlation between seasonal precipitation and seasonal mean precipitable water vapor (R<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.988). Precipitation conversion efficiency (PCE) is calculated from precipitation and precipitable water vapor. The monthly PCE reaches its maximum in October at 25.8%, and drops to its minimum in January at 11.5%. Seasonal PCE's minimum is 15.2% in autumn and 23.7% in winter, at maximum.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To do this, two different events have been selected from the 2011 summer season: one at the beginning of the season (June) and the other one at the end of the season (August). For each of these mesoscale frameworks a total of five distinct simulations were performed varying the initial soil moisture content: a control run and four additional sensitivity tests. The control run, corresponding to a low soil moisture content, is the one used within the real-time weather forecasting system implemented in the Valencia Region. In the corresponding sensitivity simulations this low value has been progressively increased in different steps until the original soil moisture content doubled. It has been found that high soil moisture is associated with colder near-surface temperature, a moister relative humidity and a slightly lower near-surface wind speed, whereas a drier soil resulted in a dryer relative humidity, warmer temperature and a slight low-level wind. In general, the highest soil moisture contents are required to reproduce the near-surface daily cycles of temperature and relative humidity through higher values of latent heat flux and lower values of sensible heat flux. In this regard, moistening the soil improves the previous results obtained using the RAMS configuration used within the operational forecasting system. However, the wind speed is not quite sensitive to changes in the soil moisture content over flatter terrain. Finally, although a warming and dryer mixing layer is obtained with the lowest soil moisture content, the mixing layer height remains practically unchanged when using the distinct configurations over flat terrain. These differences are enhanced over more complex terrain.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

An ideal statistical downscaling numerical experiment was performed for surface winds above complex terrain in Israel's northern Negev desert region. Dynamical downscaling have been performed by the WRF model to create a historical database by the following two sets. The first set used 5 nested domains from 40.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km to 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km. The second set used 3 nested domains ranging from 40.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km to 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km. The 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km data (stage 2) was defined as predictors while data on 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km (stage 1) served as predictands for statistical downscaling. Two statistical downscaling algorithms: minimal distance analog and a Bayesian inference aided analog (hereafter Bayesian algorithm) were tested by the above data. Unlike most analog algorithms, the Bayesian algorithm refers to the probability to get the best analog instead of the minimal differences between predictands. The comparison of the two algorithms shows that the Bayesian approach yields improved results. The Bayesian algorithm reproduces the 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km resolution dynamically downscaled surface winds with an average absolute direction difference of 43 and 20 for calm winds and moderate/strong winds respectively.

These datasets are the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42V7 (TRMM3B42V7) research product and the Global Land Data Assimilation (GLDAS) reanalysis system precipitation dataset, which represent 3-hourly rainfall time series at 25-km and hourly time series at 100-km spatial grid resolutions, respectively. The precipitation products, aggregated to a common 3-hourly time resolution, are used to force a distributed hydrologic model (Hillslope River Routing \u2013 HRR) for moderate and heavy precipitation events over the basin. The NCEP multi-sensor precipitation analysis (Stage IV) is used as the reference rainfall field for the evaluation of the precipitation and hydrologic simulation errors. Results show that the satellite product exhibits significantly better error statistics compared to the GLDAS. Particularly for the simulated streamflow, GLDAS is shown to have up to 7 (3) times higher mean relative error compared to the corresponding TRMM3B42V7 error metric for moderate (extreme) streamflow values. This significant divergence in the runoff simulation error statistics is attributed to differences between the two precipitation products in terms of the propagation of their error properties from precipitation to simulated streamflow. Significant improvement of the statistical scores (up to 50%) with increasing basin size is shown for the satellite product; this basin scale effect is marginal for the GLDAS product.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, how so drastic changes induced by wildfires and how the age of the burnt scar affect the small and meso-scale atmospheric boundary layer dynamics are largely unknown. These questions are relevant for process analysis, meteorological and air quality forecast but also for regional climate analysis. Such questions are addressed numerically in this study on the case of the Portugal wildfires in 2003 as a testbed. In order to study the effects of burnt scars, an ensemble of numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting modeling system (WRF) have been performed with different surface properties mimicking the surface state immediately after the fire, few days after the fire and few months after the fire. In order to investigate such issue in a seamless approach, the same modelling framework has been used with various horizontal resolutions of the model grid and land use, ranging from 3.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km, which can be considered as the typical resolution of state-of-the art regional numerical weather prediction models to 14<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km which is now the typical target resolution of regional climate models.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">The study shows that the combination of high surface heat fluxes over the burnt area, large differential heating with respect to the preserved surroundings and lower surface roughness produces very intense frontogenesis with vertical velocity reaching few meters per second. This powerful meso-scale circulation can pump more humid air from the surroundings not impacted by the wildfire and produce more cloudiness over the burnt area. The influence of soil temperature immediately after the wildfire ceases is mainly seen at night as the boundary-layer remains unstably stratified and lasts only few days. So the intensity of the induced meso-scale circulation decreases with time, even though it remains until full recovery of the vegetation. Finally all these effects are simulated whatever the land cover and model resolution and there are thus robust processes in both regional climate simulations and process studies or short-time forecast. However, the impact of burnt scars on the precipitation signal remains very uncertain, especially because low precipitation is at stake.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

ARF was estimated at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), in the atmosphere, and at the surface during the three observing conditions. During dust and anthropogenic events, average aerosol optical depth (AOD at 500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm) went up to 0.24 from the aged background observing condition 0.04. Such enhancement of AOD is associated by the combination of desert-dust and anthropogenic aerosols transported from distant sources as noticed from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Such three types of aerosols are also identified from the observed properties of single scattering albedo (SSA), aerosol asymmetry (AS) parameter, and aerosol size distribution.
