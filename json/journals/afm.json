The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem regional atmospheric model (EDBRAMS) we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. The climate response in the model simulations is generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. If, however, these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We explore relationships among key LSP dates at the start and end of the season captured by three remote sensing products (i.e., NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; PI: Phenology Index; MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) over 19 deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest sites in the northern hemisphere for 2000\u20132012, and compare these estimates to estimates of start and end of photosynthesis phenology extracted from gross primary productivity (GPP) from CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux measurements. To derive phenological transition dates, we use analytical solutions of various derivatives from the fitted logistic curves.

Given the highly variable climate in these regions, and increasing temperature overall, amelioration of extreme surface soil temperatures would have implications for soil-dependent biological activity. Reintroduction of coarse woody debris (CWD) to these woodlands may moderate surface soil temperatures. Diurnal surface soil temperatures at a depth of 2.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cm were monitored during summer and winter at different distances from CWD with varying diameters. CWD samples were located beyond the edge of neighbouring tree canopies. The result of the initial analysis showed that CWD reduced the durations of time at extremely high summer and low winter surface soil temperatures. Soil temperatures near CWD were largely maintained below the summer high of 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and above the winter low of 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C. The duration of time above 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C in summer was reduced by 93% near CWD and the duration of time below 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C in winter was reduced by 77%, compared with reference distances. Simple nonlinear statistical models were developed to explain the observed daily summer maximum and winter minimum surface soil temperatures as functions of distance from CWD and CWD diameter. The forms of these models reflected different dominant physical processes in each season. Mean summer daily maximum surface soil temperatures were significantly cooler by 11.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and mean winter daily minimum temperatures were significantly warmer by 1.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C near CWD compared to the respective mean maximum and minimum temperatures at reference distances. Increasing CWD diameter increased the range of the impact over distance from CWD in both summer and winter. During the summer maxima, larger diameter CWD also increased the magnitude of the reduction in surface soil temperature near CWD. The results of this study demonstrate that CWD can be effective in protecting surface soils from sustained exposure to extreme surface soil temperatures. Therefore, at a landscape scale, CWD could create thermal refuges better suited to soil-dependent biological activity, such as for the germination and growth of the plant understorey in woodlands. This impact of CWD may be valuable for supporting understorey productivity and diversity in cleared lands.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study had two overarching objectives: first, to compare the irrigation scheduling performance of a substrate moisture sensing approach to that of a three-dimensional predictive transpiration modeling approach in five tree species grown in a containerized pot-in-pot production system. For comparison we measured tree growth (crown leaf area and stem caliper), volume of water applied and irrigation application efficiency (<italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">e</inf>) for each method. The predictive method (i.e., a linked photosynthesis-stomatal conductance (<italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">n</inf>-<italic>g</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">s</inf>) scheme) applied 18\u201356% more water than the sensing-based method in four species and 6% less in the fifth. Mean <italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> was 80.1 and 89.5% for predictive and sensing-based treatments, respectively. Across species, predictive scheduling yielded 19\u201353% greater leaf area and 3.4\u201311% more caliper growth than sensing-based scheduling. Our second objective was to determine if the accuracy of the <italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">n</inf>-<italic>g</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">s</inf> scheme could be retained while using generalized multi-species means for key physiological input parameters instead of species-specific values.

In this study, we evaluated two single-source operational methodologies, the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), to scrutinize the surface energy balance components using Landsat TM/ETM+ images collected between 2002 and 2013. Estimations from the models were compared with ground observations from two grassland and two cropland AsiaFlux tower sites. To examine model behaviors adequately, both SEBS and METRIC were parameterized using the same predictions of instantaneous and daily net radiation (<italic>R</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>N</italic> </inf>)<italic>.</italic> The <italic>R</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>N</italic> </inf> estimations were quite promising; the ensemble averaged (from all sites) bias and root mean square error (RMSE) were within 39<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. In terms of the soil heat flux (<italic>G</italic>) and sensible heat flux (<italic>H</italic>), both models showed various contrasted outputs at the tower and spatial scales, yielding a maximum difference of 77<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. The estimated <italic>G</italic> from the albedo-based method (METRIC) had low bias and RMSE within 46<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>, whereas that obtained from the fractional vegetation cover based method (SEBS) exceeded 125<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. However, the SEBS model performed better for <italic>H</italic> estimations, yielded less bias and an RMSE (averaged) within 82<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>, compared with errors of 102<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> obtained from METRIC. The slightly higher errors in METRIC were caused by its original design based on internal calibration, which lumped the maximum biases from other variables into the estimated <italic>H</italic>. The errors in <italic>G</italic> (SEBS) were almost equal to the errors in <italic>H</italic> (METRIC) but of the opposite sign. Because the latent heat flux is calculated as a rest-term, the errors in <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic> compensate for each other. Therefore, both models performed similarly in consistently overestimating the latent heat flux (LE) and corresponding daily ET because of energy balance misclosure in the eddy covariance flux measurements. Three different closure approaches [least squares linear regression (REG), Bowen ratio (BR), and residual (RE) correction] were used, and both models had daily ET with less bias and RMSE (averaged) within 0.16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> and 0.62<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>, respectively, using REG. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis suggested that corrections of radiometric to absolute surface temperature are essentially required only for SEBS, whereas the accurate calibration of cold and hot end-points is important for METRIC implementation. These evaluations promote better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both models for mapping the surface energy balance at the regional scale and are a step toward an integrated methodology for a wide range of heterogeneous ecosystems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study measured CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes with eddy covariance (EC) in one of those large canopy gaps, and estimated understory fluxes in a black spruce forest in 2011\u20132014. Then understory fluxes and ecosystem fluxes were compared. The understory fluxes during the snow-free seasons were determined by two approaches. The first approach determined understory fluxes as the fluxes from the canopy gap, assuming that fluxes under the canopy crown also had the same magnitude as the canopy gap fluxes. The second approach determined the understory fluxes by scaling canopy gap fluxes with a canopy gap fraction, assuming that only canopy gaps, which mostly constitutes the forest floor, contribute to fluxes. The true understory fluxes would be in between these two estimates. Overall, the understory accounted for 53% (39\u201366%), 61% (45\u201377%), 63% (45\u201380%), 73% (56\u201390%), and 79% (59\u201398%) of the total net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), sensible heat flux (<italic>H</italic>), and latent heat flux (LE), respectively.

Seasonal dynamics coinciding with the phenological cycle were seen in Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), though with greater dynamic range in Hyperion than MODIS MOD09A1_500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m, as a result primarily of spectral properties.

All three covers showed lower GPP estimates in dry season despite higher Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) values suggesting that water availability rather than PAR is the critical factor governing GPP of tropical dry deciduous forests. Given the patchy landscape and moisture-driven seasonal cycle of phenology and GPP, spatial resolutions of better than 250<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m and narrowband spectral features like Hyperion are necessary for monitoring phenology and GPP of tropical dry deciduous forests, providing a basis for improving methodologies of photosynthesis products from upcoming EnMAP and HyspIRI programs.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We also examined growth in relation to several climatic variables (annual and seasonal temperatures, thermal oscillation, rainfall and a hydric index measuring water stress) and two cultural practices (irrigation and pruning). The relative contribution of each variable on growth measurements was assessed through regression trees and linear models. Growth of stone pine showed marked differences among the three MZs.

The number of heavy precipitation events (&amp;gt;10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>) was the most important PEC to impact GPP in the temperate steppe. Years with more frequent heavy precipitation events favored higher GPP. However, in contrast with the case in the temperate steppe, precipitation interval was the factor that affected GPP most in the alpine meadow. GPP was higher as the precipitation intervals lengthened or their distribution shifted to fewer but longer intervals (concentrated distribution). Additionally, the mechanisms for the effects of PEC on GPP also differed between these two ecosystems. Compared with small events, heavy precipitation events recharged deeper soil layers in the temperate steppe, which was biologically more meaningful for plant transpiration (i.e., an increase in the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration), relief from drought stress (an increase in the duration of high soil water content), and thereby higher GPP. In contrast, mean air temperature was higher in the alpine meadow when the precipitation intervals increased or their distribution was more concentrated, leading to a longer period of higher temperature that was favorable to higher GPP. Our results imply that soil water is not the exclusive means of revealing the mechanism of precipitation affecting productivity; the corresponding changes in temperature along with precipitation events may also play a substantial role in temperature-limited grasslands.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Temperature decreases can only be introduced successfully if the constraints of ecological and economic feasibility involved are known. To this end, two experiments were conducted in which tomato plants were cultivated at day and night heating set points of 20/18, 16/14 and 11/9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C, respectively. In all of the treatments, the set points for opening the ventilation were an air temperature of 27<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and 80% relative air humidity. Crop photosynthesis appeared to be unaffected by the temperature set point for heating, although the concentrations of leaf soluble sugar and starch increased significantly at low temperatures compared to at high temperatures. The reduction in the temperature set points also appeared to have no impact on the total production of dry matter, the dry matter fraction allocated to the fruit and, thus, the total fruit yield. However, each one Kelvin reduction in temperature resulted in a 3.5-day increase in the time required for fruit to develop and, thus, in a considerable delay of the first harvest. This delay was balanced out by higher yields generated in later harvests. The temperature of the fruit itself rather than that of the complete plant was responsible for this delay. Surprisingly, the reduction in temperature had little effect on the quality of the fruit: the mass of single fruits increased significantly as temperature decreased. However, there was no effect on the fruit reducing sugar content, and only a slight decrease in fruit titratable acid content. From an ecological perspective, carbon dioxide emissions caused by tomato production can be cut considerably by reducing the heating set points without affecting yield and only having a slight effect on the quality of the fruit. From an economic perspective, any loss of profit due to the delay of harvests would have to be balanced out by the savings generating by turning down the heating.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

One limitation to investigating gaps is the lack of efficient, accurate, and objective methods to characterize gap size and shape. This study aimed at investigating various methodologies to overcome this limitation. Six man-made canopy gaps were measured in a coniferous and a deciduous Stand (total of twelve) using a terrestrial laser scanner. Using the point clouds from these measurements, gap sizes were manually derived as a baseline to assess the accuracy of using fully automatic delineations of edge-lines for gap size calculations. Furthermore, we compared these results to those obtained from simulated conventional gap measurements that are based on assumptions regarding the gap shape (ellipse) or on a varying number of distance measurements (between gap center and Stand edge). Using the manual gap delineations as a reference, automatic delineations yielded slightly smaller gap sizes with a relative root mean square error between 3.4% and 5.3%, depending on gaps size. All simulated conventional approaches (with various numbers of measurements and shape assumptions) yielded larger errors. However, the gain in accuracy by increasing the sample size declined rapidly when more than 16 measurements were taken to describe the gap shape. To further the discussion about gap shape, we developed an approach to calculate the fractal dimension of the canopy gap edge-line from laser point clouds. Finally, we discuss other approaches to deepen our understanding of gap related processes in forests by means of a more detailed description of the three-dimensional gap shape.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

As cold biomes in high-altitude ecoregions, they have drawn a growing concern of the potential vulnerability to current and future climate change. In this study, we retrieved the time series (2000\u20132013) of satellite-based phenological transitions (the onset and offset of vegetative growth) for subalpine shrubs at five individual sites in the Qilian Mountains in northwestern China. Our goals were to identify the climatic constraints on the timing of leaf-out and leaf-fall, and to project these phenological patterns under the future climate conditions. To achieve these goals, the relationships between these regional phenological events and climate variables were investigated with univariate and multivariate time series models, and the future phenological dynamics were forecasted for two decades based on the best predictive models under the A2 and B2 of IPCCs Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Our results generally revealed site-dependent phenology\u2013climate relationships, which involved an immediate phenological response to the mean or minimum temperature in the corresponding month of occurrence, and a lagged cumulative climate effect across preceding months and seasons. Average temperature during a certain period has been demonstrated as an important limiting factor for plant growth. However, our results also provided evidence for the minimum temperature controls of the development of phenological events in subalpine shrublands, possibly due to a close association with the frequency of frost risk in spring and autumn. Under future climate conditions, an overall lengthening of the active growing season is expected at each of the study sites depending on elevation. Consequently, net carbon uptake by shrubs will benefit from the increased temperature.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The expected effects of climate change on forest disturbance (e.g., insect outbreak) regime call for a better insight into the growth responses of trees to varying environmental conditions over geographical regions in eastern North America. In this study, the effects of a latitudinal thermal gradient and spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks on the tree growth of black spruce (<italic>Picea mariana</italic> Mill.) were investigated along a 400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km transect from 48\u00b0N to 51\u00b0N across the continuous boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. Time series data were analyzed to synchronize climatic factors (temperature and precipitation trends), insect dynamics (SBW population frequency) and tree growth (ring-width chronology). Radial growth resulted as being synchronized with climate patterns, highlighting a positive effect of maximum temperatures on tree growth, especially in the northernmost site. Increasing temperatures and precipitation had a more positive effect on tree growth during epidemic periods, whereas the detrimental effects of SBW outbreaks on tree growth were observed with climate patterns characterized by lowered temperature. The lag between time series, synchrony and/or frequency of synchrony between tree growth and SBW outbreak were considered in order to link the growth of host trees and the dynamics of insect populations. The proposed analytical approach defined damage severity on tree growth in relation to population dynamics and climate fluctuations at the northern distribution limit of the insect. Overall, a decline in tree growth was observed in these boreal forests, due to SBW outbreaks acting in combination with other stress factors.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Predicting current and future levels of plant drought stress is important not only at the local scale, but also at larger, landscape to regional, scales, because these are the management scales at which adaptation and mitigation strategies are implemented. To obtain reliable predictions of soil moisture and plant drought stress over large extents, water balance models need to be complemented with detailed information about the spatial variation of vegetation and soil attributes. We designed, calibrated and validated a water balance model that produces annual estimates of drought intensity and duration for all plant cohorts in a forest stand. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as a case study, we coupled this model with plot records from two Spanish forest inventories in which species identity, diameter and height of plant cohorts were available. Leaf area index of each plant cohort was estimated from basal area using species-specific relationships. Vertical root distribution for each species in each forest plot was estimated by determining the distribution that maximized transpiration in the model, given average climatic conditions, soil attributes and stand density. We determined recent trends (period 1980\u20132010) in drought stress for the main tree species in Catalonia; where forest growth and densification occurs in many areas as a result of rural abandonment and decrease of forest management. Regional increases in drought stress were detected for most tree species, although we found high variation in stress changes among individual forest plots. Moreover, predicted trends in tree drought stress were mainly due to changes in leaf area occurred between the two forest inventories rather than to climatic trends. We conclude that forest structure needs to be explicitly considered in assessments of plant drought stress patterns and trends over large geographic areas, and that forest inventories are useful sources of data provided that reasonably good estimates of soil attributes and root distribution are available. Our approach coupled with recent improvements in forest survey technologies may allow obtaining spatially continuous and precise assessments of drought stress. Further efforts are needed to calibrate drought-related demographic processes before water balance and drought stress estimates can be fully used for the accurate prediction of drought impacts.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> treatments.

We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance.

All indices correlated well with Gs over deciduous broadleaf forests, explaining 40\u201360% of Gs variations, however, the optical-based models had lower RMSE than the microwave FI model. In contrast, the FI model yielded the best performance to estimate Gs in evergreen forests (EBF and ENF). Overall, a combined microwave-optical model resulted in the best Gs estimates in these evergreen forests compared with the individual model approaches. In general, the PM-models explained more than 70% of the variance in LE with RMSE lower than 20<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>. Based on these results, we developed a new approach combining optical and passive microwave indices based on their spatial vs. temporal synergies to generate Gs time series. This combined optical-microwave approach produced the best ET estimates for evergreen forest and offered a robust approach for deciduous forest without sacrificing precision.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To overcome these challenges, multi-scale data including field-measured biomass, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, were combined in a hierarchical modeling framework. Data derived at each scale were used to validate an increasingly broader index of sagebrush (<italic>Artemisia tridentata</italic>) aboveground biomass. First, two automatic crown delineation methods were used to delineate individual shrubs across the TLS plots. Second, three models to derive shrub volumes were utilized with TLS data and regressed against destructively-sampled individual shrub biomass measurements. Third, TLS-derived biomass estimates at 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m were used to calibrate a biomass prediction model with a linear regression of ALS-derived percent vegetation cover (adjusted <italic>R</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.87, <italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.001, RMSE<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>3.59<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kg).

The biomass estimates at the scale of 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m is sufficient for capturing the variability of biomass needed to initialize models to estimate ecosystem fluxes, and the contiguous estimates across the watershed support analyzing patterns and connectivity of these dynamics. Our model is currently optimized for the sagebrush-steppe environment at the watershed scale and may be readily applied to other shrub-dominated drylands, and especially the Great Basin, U.S., which extends across five western states. Improved derived metrics from ALS data and collection of additional TLS data to refine the relationship between TLS-derived biomass estimates and ALS-derived models of vegetation structure, will strengthen the predictive power of our model and extend its range to similar shrubland ecosystems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A common measure to protect soil against erosion is afforestation. There is growing evidence that mixed-species forest stands have beneficial effects on ecosystem functions (growth rates, nutrient cycling). In addition, species-rich forests tend to have higher and denser crown cover and thus might affect soil erosion. This study investigated the role of tree species richness on throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) as an important part of the soil erosion process and examined the spatial variability of TKE in mixed-species forest stands.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0070\" view=\"all\">The research was conducted within BEF-China, a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China.

Lower TKE below the first branch than FKE can be attributed to low rain drop velocities due to short falling heights. Higher TKE in the middle of four tree individuals than FKE can be ascribed to a larger crown area on which drops can confluence resulting in an increase of drop mass. Furthermore, TKE was positively affected by the number of influencing tree individuals with a 13% increase of TKE from one to four influencing tree individuals.

These processes will result in changes in the local carbon, water, and energy balances. Two closely located eddy covariance towers on native prairie sites in Kansas with differing burn regimes provided a unique opportunity to investigate those changes with minimal confounding climate factors. Daytime turbulent fluxes were analyzed throughout the growing season during two wet years (2008, 2009) and one drought year (2011). The site experiencing more woody encroachment (K4B) was a greater carbon sink every year, especially in 2011, when the annually burned site (KON) became a negligible sink and potential source of carbon. K4B also had greater seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) at all times except during drought and when burned. Evidence of water loss from deeper, stored sources was shown at K4B through cumulative evaporative loss that exceeded precipitation during drought conditions. Changes in the nature of the turbulent fluxes were also investigated through deviations from similarity theory, quadrant analysis, and wavelet decomposition. Wavelet analysis determined the size of eddies primarily involved in net exchange, showing differences between sites across small to medium scales (average diameter of 4.0\u2013108<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m). Increased surface heterogeneity and roughness with woody encroachment was seen through smaller eddy size of maximum transport and slightly weakened applicability of similarity theory at K4B. Eddy size decreased over the course of the growing season, in a strikingly inverse relation to grass leaf area index, likely corresponding to greater canopy height and roughness. Variance of the correlation between carbon and water, indicative of more variable plant productivity, is much greater across all scales in 2011 at KON only. Overall, results indicate woody encroachment increases resilience to drought. Though carbon sequestration remains stronger at the woody encroachment site, it comes at the cost of far increased water loss, including from deeper groundwater resources, which could prove detrimental in combination with predicted climate change.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The cause for discrepancies between surface heat fluxes derived from the EC system and those from the MWS systems and the two-wavelength method are possibly related to inaccurate assignment of the structure parameter of temperature and humidity. Additionally, measurements from MWSs can be associated with two values of the Bowen ratio, thereby leading to uncertainties in the estimation of the fluxes.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate recent modifications and further refinements to a multi-layer plant canopy model for simulating temperature and water vapor within three diverse forest canopies: a 4.5-m tall aspen thicket, a 15-m tall aspen canopy, and a 60-m tall Douglas fir canopy. Performance of the model was strongly related to source strength and profile stability within the canopy. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between simulated and observed values tended to be higher for the summer periods when there was much more heat and vapor added to the canopy space due to solar warming and transpiration. Conversely, RMSD for vapor pressure was lowest for the winter periods when vapor additions within the canopy space were minimal. RMSD for temperature ranged from 0.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during the winter to 1.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer period. RMSD for vapor pressure ranged from 0.002<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kPa for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during winter to 0.141<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kPa for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer. Unstable profile conditions were simulated better by the model than stable conditions for all sites. RMSD for temperature at the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen, 15-m aspen and 60-m Douglas fir were 0.89, 0.77, and 0.85<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C, respectively, for unstable conditions compared to 1.44, 0.89 and 1.16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for stable conditions. Stable profiles are more challenging to accurately simulate because dispersion within a stable profile is lower thereby creating larger gradients. Temperature differences between the bottom and above canopy sensors were within 3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for unstable conditions for all sites, but were as much as \u221210<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C under stable conditions. The model exhibited the greatest discrepancies relative to measurements in the 4.5-m aspen thicket under stable conditions, likely due to horizontal ejections from this relatively small patch of vegetation that could not be addressed by the one-dimensional model. At each site, the model performed best near the top of canopy where the air was well mixed and gradients between it the meteorological conditions above the canopy used to force the model were minimal.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Previous research suggests fluctuations in tidal inundation, temperature and salinity can influence forest metabolism and C cycling. Carbon dioxide (CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>) from respiration that occurs from below the canopy is contributed from different components. In this study, we investigated variation in CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux among different below-canopy components (soil, leaf litter, course woody debris, soil including pneumatophores, prop roots, and surface water) in a riverine mangrove forest of Shark River Slough estuary, Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). The range in CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux from different components exceeded that measured among sites along the oligohaline-saline gradient. Black mangrove (<italic>Avicennia germinans</italic>) pneumatophores contributed the largest average CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux. Over a narrow range of estuarine salinity (25\u201335 practical salinity units (PSU)), increased salinity resulted in lower CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux to the atmosphere. Tidal inundation reduced soil CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux overall but increased the partial pressure of CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> (<italic>p</italic>CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>) observed in the overlying surface water upon flooding.

An understanding of below-canopy CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> component fluxes and their contributions to ER can help to elucidate how C cycling will change with discrete disturbance events (e.g., hurricanes) and long-term change, including sea-level rise, and potential impact mangrove forests. As such, key controls on below-canopy ER must be taken into consideration when developing and modeling mangrove forest C budgets.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Most studies attribute this purely to underlying physical templates, such as groundwater salinity gradients caused by tidal flux and topography. However, a few recent studies hypothesize that self-reinforcing feedback between vegetation and vadose zone salinity are also involved and create a bistable situation in which either halophytic dominated habitat or freshwater plant communities may dominate as alternative stable states. Here, we revisit the bistability hypothesis and demonstrate the mechanisms that result in bistability. We demonstrate with remote sensing imagery the sharp boundaries between freshwater hardwood hammock communities in southern Florida and halophytic communities such as buttonwood hammocks and mangroves. We further document from the literature how transpiration of mangroves and freshwater plants respond differently to vadose zone salinity, thus altering the salinity through feedback. Using mathematical models, we show how the self-reinforcing feedback, together with physical template, controls the ecotones between halophytic and freshwater communities. Regions of bistability along environmental gradients of salinity have the potential for large-scale vegetation shifts following pulse disturbances such as hurricane tidal surges in Florida, or tsunamis in other regions. The size of the region of bistability can be large for low-lying coastal habitat due to the saline water table, which extends inland due to salinity intrusion.

Here, we apply a simple model to estimate stand water use (<italic>S</italic>), determine the contribution of <italic>S</italic> to evapotranspiration (ET), and approximate the distribution of <italic>S</italic> versus ET over annual cycles for three mangrove forests in southwest Florida, USA.

This represents 34\u201349% of ET for Rookery Bay mangroves, a rather conservative rate of <italic>S</italic>, and 63\u201366% of ET for the Shark River mangroves, a less conservative rate of <italic>S</italic>. However, variability in estimates of <italic>S</italic> in mangroves is high enough to require additional study on the spatial changes related to forest structural shifts, different tidal regimes, and variable site-specific salinity concentrations in multiple mangrove forests before a true account of water use conservation strategies can be understood at the landscape scale. Evidence does suggest that large, well-developed mangrove forests have the potential to contribute considerably to the ET balance; however, regionally most mangrove forests are much smaller in stature in Florida and likely contribute less to regional water losses through stand-level transpiration.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Satellite remote sensing can play a crucial role in identifying regional ET trends and surface energy changes after disturbances in isolated and inaccessible areas of coastal mangrove wetlands, like those found in Everglades National Park in southern Florida. Using a combination of long-term datasets acquired from the NASA Landsat 5TM satellite database and the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research project, the present study investigates how ET as well as radiation and other energy balance parameters in the Everglades mangrove ecotone have responded to multiple hurricane events and restoration projects over the past two decades. An energy balance model using satellite data was used to estimate latent heat (<italic>\u03bbE</italic>) in tall and scrub mangrove environments. An eddy-covariance tower and weather tower supplied long-term data of multiple environmental and meteorological parameters that were used in calibrating and testing the modeled results from the Landsat images. Results identified significant differences in <italic>\u03bbE</italic> and soil heat flux measurements between the tall and scrub, and fringe and basin mangrove environments. The scrub mangrove site had the lowest <italic>\u03bbE</italic> rates, highest soil heat flux and lowest biophysical index (i.e., Fractional Vegetation Cover (<italic>FVC</italic>), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) values. Mangrove damage and mortality associated with two strong hurricanes decreased <italic>FVC</italic>, NDVI, and SAVI, and increased soil heat flux at the tall mangrove site located in a basin-type environment. Recovery of the spectral characteristics, energy balance parameters and <italic>\u03bbE</italic> following hurricane disturbance was quicker in fringe mangroves than in basin mangroves. Latent heat fluxes (<italic>\u03bbE</italic>) were also relatively high after each storm and may have increased as a result of increasing vapor pressure deficits. Remote sensing of the surface energy balance and <italic>\u03bbE</italic> of mangrove forests can help our understanding of how these environments respond to disturbances to the landscape and the effect that these changes can have on the energy and water budget. Moreover, relationships between energy and water balance components developed for the coastal mangroves of southern Florida could be extrapolated to other mangrove systems in the Caribbean to measure changes caused by natural events and human modifications.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
