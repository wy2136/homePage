The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem regional atmospheric model (EDBRAMS) we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. The climate response in the model simulations is generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. If, however, these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We explore relationships among key LSP dates at the start and end of the season captured by three remote sensing products (i.e., NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; PI: Phenology Index; MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) over 19 deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest sites in the northern hemisphere for 2000\u20132012, and compare these estimates to estimates of start and end of photosynthesis phenology extracted from gross primary productivity (GPP) from CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> flux measurements. To derive phenological transition dates, we use analytical solutions of various derivatives from the fitted logistic curves.

Given the highly variable climate in these regions, and increasing temperature overall, amelioration of extreme surface soil temperatures would have implications for soil-dependent biological activity. Reintroduction of coarse woody debris (CWD) to these woodlands may moderate surface soil temperatures. Diurnal surface soil temperatures at a depth of 2.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cm were monitored during summer and winter at different distances from CWD with varying diameters. CWD samples were located beyond the edge of neighbouring tree canopies. The result of the initial analysis showed that CWD reduced the durations of time at extremely high summer and low winter surface soil temperatures. Soil temperatures near CWD were largely maintained below the summer high of 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and above the winter low of 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C. The duration of time above 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C in summer was reduced by 93% near CWD and the duration of time below 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C in winter was reduced by 77%, compared with reference distances. Simple nonlinear statistical models were developed to explain the observed daily summer maximum and winter minimum surface soil temperatures as functions of distance from CWD and CWD diameter. The forms of these models reflected different dominant physical processes in each season. Mean summer daily maximum surface soil temperatures were significantly cooler by 11.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and mean winter daily minimum temperatures were significantly warmer by 1.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C near CWD compared to the respective mean maximum and minimum temperatures at reference distances. Increasing CWD diameter increased the range of the impact over distance from CWD in both summer and winter. During the summer maxima, larger diameter CWD also increased the magnitude of the reduction in surface soil temperature near CWD. The results of this study demonstrate that CWD can be effective in protecting surface soils from sustained exposure to extreme surface soil temperatures. Therefore, at a landscape scale, CWD could create thermal refuges better suited to soil-dependent biological activity, such as for the germination and growth of the plant understorey in woodlands. This impact of CWD may be valuable for supporting understorey productivity and diversity in cleared lands.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study had two overarching objectives: first, to compare the irrigation scheduling performance of a substrate moisture sensing approach to that of a three-dimensional predictive transpiration modeling approach in five tree species grown in a containerized pot-in-pot production system. For comparison we measured tree growth (crown leaf area and stem caliper), volume of water applied and irrigation application efficiency (<italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">e</inf>) for each method. The predictive method (i.e., a linked photosynthesis-stomatal conductance (<italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">n</inf>-<italic>g</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">s</inf>) scheme) applied 18\u201356% more water than the sensing-based method in four species and 6% less in the fifth. Mean <italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> was 80.1 and 89.5% for predictive and sensing-based treatments, respectively. Across species, predictive scheduling yielded 19\u201353% greater leaf area and 3.4\u201311% more caliper growth than sensing-based scheduling. Our second objective was to determine if the accuracy of the <italic>A</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">n</inf>-<italic>g</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">s</inf> scheme could be retained while using generalized multi-species means for key physiological input parameters instead of species-specific values.

In this study, we evaluated two single-source operational methodologies, the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), to scrutinize the surface energy balance components using Landsat TM/ETM+ images collected between 2002 and 2013. Estimations from the models were compared with ground observations from two grassland and two cropland AsiaFlux tower sites. To examine model behaviors adequately, both SEBS and METRIC were parameterized using the same predictions of instantaneous and daily net radiation (<italic>R</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>N</italic> </inf>)<italic>.</italic> The <italic>R</italic> <inf loc=\"post\"> <italic>N</italic> </inf> estimations were quite promising; the ensemble averaged (from all sites) bias and root mean square error (RMSE) were within 39<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. In terms of the soil heat flux (<italic>G</italic>) and sensible heat flux (<italic>H</italic>), both models showed various contrasted outputs at the tower and spatial scales, yielding a maximum difference of 77<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. The estimated <italic>G</italic> from the albedo-based method (METRIC) had low bias and RMSE within 46<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>, whereas that obtained from the fractional vegetation cover based method (SEBS) exceeded 125<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>. However, the SEBS model performed better for <italic>H</italic> estimations, yielded less bias and an RMSE (averaged) within 82<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup>, compared with errors of 102<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> obtained from METRIC. The slightly higher errors in METRIC were caused by its original design based on internal calibration, which lumped the maximum biases from other variables into the estimated <italic>H</italic>. The errors in <italic>G</italic> (SEBS) were almost equal to the errors in <italic>H</italic> (METRIC) but of the opposite sign. Because the latent heat flux is calculated as a rest-term, the errors in <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic> compensate for each other. Therefore, both models performed similarly in consistently overestimating the latent heat flux (LE) and corresponding daily ET because of energy balance misclosure in the eddy covariance flux measurements. Three different closure approaches [least squares linear regression (REG), Bowen ratio (BR), and residual (RE) correction] were used, and both models had daily ET with less bias and RMSE (averaged) within 0.16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> and 0.62<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>, respectively, using REG. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis suggested that corrections of radiometric to absolute surface temperature are essentially required only for SEBS, whereas the accurate calibration of cold and hot end-points is important for METRIC implementation. These evaluations promote better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both models for mapping the surface energy balance at the regional scale and are a step toward an integrated methodology for a wide range of heterogeneous ecosystems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study measured CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes with eddy covariance (EC) in one of those large canopy gaps, and estimated understory fluxes in a black spruce forest in 2011\u20132014. Then understory fluxes and ecosystem fluxes were compared. The understory fluxes during the snow-free seasons were determined by two approaches. The first approach determined understory fluxes as the fluxes from the canopy gap, assuming that fluxes under the canopy crown also had the same magnitude as the canopy gap fluxes. The second approach determined the understory fluxes by scaling canopy gap fluxes with a canopy gap fraction, assuming that only canopy gaps, which mostly constitutes the forest floor, contribute to fluxes. The true understory fluxes would be in between these two estimates. Overall, the understory accounted for 53% (39\u201366%), 61% (45\u201377%), 63% (45\u201380%), 73% (56\u201390%), and 79% (59\u201398%) of the total net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), sensible heat flux (<italic>H</italic>), and latent heat flux (LE), respectively.

The Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) was applied to time-series of Hyperion and MODIS (MOD09A1_500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m) reflectance values to evaluate spatial and spectral resolution impacts on inference of seasonal variation in phenology and GPP for Teak, Bamboo and Mixed tropical deciduous vegetation ecosystems of Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. Seasonal dynamics coinciding with the phenological cycle were seen in Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), though with greater dynamic range in Hyperion than MODIS MOD09A1_500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m, as a result primarily of spectral properties. In contrast, GPP values from MOD17A2_1000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m did not similarly track observed phenological changes.

One limitation to investigating gaps is the lack of efficient, accurate, and objective methods to characterize gap size and shape. This study aimed at investigating various methodologies to overcome this limitation. Six man-made canopy gaps were measured in a coniferous and a deciduous Stand (total of twelve) using a terrestrial laser scanner. Using the point clouds from these measurements, gap sizes were manually derived as a baseline to assess the accuracy of using fully automatic delineations of edge-lines for gap size calculations. Furthermore, we compared these results to those obtained from simulated conventional gap measurements that are based on assumptions regarding the gap shape (ellipse) or on a varying number of distance measurements (between gap center and Stand edge). Using the manual gap delineations as a reference, automatic delineations yielded slightly smaller gap sizes with a relative root mean square error between 3.4% and 5.3%, depending on gaps size. All simulated conventional approaches (with various numbers of measurements and shape assumptions) yielded larger errors. However, the gain in accuracy by increasing the sample size declined rapidly when more than 16 measurements were taken to describe the gap shape. To further the discussion about gap shape, we developed an approach to calculate the fractal dimension of the canopy gap edge-line from laser point clouds. Finally, we discuss other approaches to deepen our understanding of gap related processes in forests by means of a more detailed description of the three-dimensional gap shape.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we retrieved the time series (2000\u20132013) of satellite-based phenological transitions (the onset and offset of vegetative growth) for subalpine shrubs at five individual sites in the Qilian Mountains in northwestern China. Our goals were to identify the climatic constraints on the timing of leaf-out and leaf-fall, and to project these phenological patterns under the future climate conditions. To achieve these goals, the relationships between these regional phenological events and climate variables were investigated with univariate and multivariate time series models, and the future phenological dynamics were forecasted for two decades based on the best predictive models under the A2 and B2 of IPCCs Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Our results generally revealed site-dependent phenology\u2013climate relationships, which involved an immediate phenological response to the mean or minimum temperature in the corresponding month of occurrence, and a lagged cumulative climate effect across preceding months and seasons. Average temperature during a certain period has been demonstrated as an important limiting factor for plant growth. However, our results also provided evidence for the minimum temperature controls of the development of phenological events in subalpine shrublands, possibly due to a close association with the frequency of frost risk in spring and autumn. Under future climate conditions, an overall lengthening of the active growing season is expected at each of the study sites depending on elevation.

Radial growth resulted as being synchronized with climate patterns, highlighting a positive effect of maximum temperatures on tree growth, especially in the northernmost site. Increasing temperatures and precipitation had a more positive effect on tree growth during epidemic periods, whereas the detrimental effects of SBW outbreaks on tree growth were observed with climate patterns characterized by lowered temperature. The lag between time series, synchrony and/or frequency of synchrony between tree growth and SBW outbreak were considered in order to link the growth of host trees and the dynamics of insect populations. The proposed analytical approach defined damage severity on tree growth in relation to population dynamics and climate fluctuations at the northern distribution limit of the insect.

Predicting current and future levels of plant drought stress is important not only at the local scale, but also at larger, landscape to regional, scales, because these are the management scales at which adaptation and mitigation strategies are implemented. To obtain reliable predictions of soil moisture and plant drought stress over large extents, water balance models need to be complemented with detailed information about the spatial variation of vegetation and soil attributes. We designed, calibrated and validated a water balance model that produces annual estimates of drought intensity and duration for all plant cohorts in a forest stand. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as a case study, we coupled this model with plot records from two Spanish forest inventories in which species identity, diameter and height of plant cohorts were available. Leaf area index of each plant cohort was estimated from basal area using species-specific relationships. Vertical root distribution for each species in each forest plot was estimated by determining the distribution that maximized transpiration in the model, given average climatic conditions, soil attributes and stand density. We determined recent trends (period 1980\u20132010) in drought stress for the main tree species in Catalonia; where forest growth and densification occurs in many areas as a result of rural abandonment and decrease of forest management. Regional increases in drought stress were detected for most tree species, although we found high variation in stress changes among individual forest plots. Moreover, predicted trends in tree drought stress were mainly due to changes in leaf area occurred between the two forest inventories rather than to climatic trends. We conclude that forest structure needs to be explicitly considered in assessments of plant drought stress patterns and trends over large geographic areas, and that forest inventories are useful sources of data provided that reasonably good estimates of soil attributes and root distribution are available. Our approach coupled with recent improvements in forest survey technologies may allow obtaining spatially continuous and precise assessments of drought stress. Further efforts are needed to calibrate drought-related demographic processes before water balance and drought stress estimates can be fully used for the accurate prediction of drought impacts.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> had relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> treatments.

We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance.

The biomass estimates at the scale of 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m is sufficient for capturing the variability of biomass needed to initialize models to estimate ecosystem fluxes, and the contiguous estimates across the watershed support analyzing patterns and connectivity of these dynamics. Our model is currently optimized for the sagebrush-steppe environment at the watershed scale and may be readily applied to other shrub-dominated drylands, and especially the Great Basin, U.S., which extends across five western states. Improved derived metrics from ALS data and collection of additional TLS data to refine the relationship between TLS-derived biomass estimates and ALS-derived models of vegetation structure, will strengthen the predictive power of our model and extend its range to similar shrubland ecosystems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A common measure to protect soil against erosion is afforestation. There is growing evidence that mixed-species forest stands have beneficial effects on ecosystem functions (growth rates, nutrient cycling). In addition, species-rich forests tend to have higher and denser crown cover and thus might affect soil erosion.

Lower TKE below the first branch than FKE can be attributed to low rain drop velocities due to short falling heights. Higher TKE in the middle of four tree individuals than FKE can be ascribed to a larger crown area on which drops can confluence resulting in an increase of drop mass. Furthermore, TKE was positively affected by the number of influencing tree individuals with a 13% increase of TKE from one to four influencing tree individuals.

These processes will result in changes in the local carbon, water, and energy balances. Two closely located eddy covariance towers on native prairie sites in Kansas with differing burn regimes provided a unique opportunity to investigate those changes with minimal confounding climate factors. Daytime turbulent fluxes were analyzed throughout the growing season during two wet years (2008, 2009) and one drought year (2011). The site experiencing more woody encroachment (K4B) was a greater carbon sink every year, especially in 2011, when the annually burned site (KON) became a negligible sink and potential source of carbon. K4B also had greater seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) at all times except during drought and when burned. Evidence of water loss from deeper, stored sources was shown at K4B through cumulative evaporative loss that exceeded precipitation during drought conditions. Changes in the nature of the turbulent fluxes were also investigated through deviations from similarity theory, quadrant analysis, and wavelet decomposition. Wavelet analysis determined the size of eddies primarily involved in net exchange, showing differences between sites across small to medium scales (average diameter of 4.0\u2013108<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m). Increased surface heterogeneity and roughness with woody encroachment was seen through smaller eddy size of maximum transport and slightly weakened applicability of similarity theory at K4B. Eddy size decreased over the course of the growing season, in a strikingly inverse relation to grass leaf area index, likely corresponding to greater canopy height and roughness. Variance of the correlation between carbon and water, indicative of more variable plant productivity, is much greater across all scales in 2011 at KON only. Overall, results indicate woody encroachment increases resilience to drought.

The cause for discrepancies between surface heat fluxes derived from the EC system and those from the MWS systems and the two-wavelength method are possibly related to inaccurate assignment of the structure parameter of temperature and humidity. Additionally, measurements from MWSs can be associated with two values of the Bowen ratio, thereby leading to uncertainties in the estimation of the fluxes.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate recent modifications and further refinements to a multi-layer plant canopy model for simulating temperature and water vapor within three diverse forest canopies: a 4.5-m tall aspen thicket, a 15-m tall aspen canopy, and a 60-m tall Douglas fir canopy. Performance of the model was strongly related to source strength and profile stability within the canopy. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between simulated and observed values tended to be higher for the summer periods when there was much more heat and vapor added to the canopy space due to solar warming and transpiration. Conversely, RMSD for vapor pressure was lowest for the winter periods when vapor additions within the canopy space were minimal. RMSD for temperature ranged from 0.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during the winter to 1.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer period. RMSD for vapor pressure ranged from 0.002<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kPa for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during winter to 0.141<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kPa for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer. Unstable profile conditions were simulated better by the model than stable conditions for all sites. RMSD for temperature at the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen, 15-m aspen and 60-m Douglas fir were 0.89, 0.77, and 0.85<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C, respectively, for unstable conditions compared to 1.44, 0.89 and 1.16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for stable conditions. Stable profiles are more challenging to accurately simulate because dispersion within a stable profile is lower thereby creating larger gradients. Temperature differences between the bottom and above canopy sensors were within 3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C for unstable conditions for all sites, but were as much as \u221210<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C under stable conditions. The model exhibited the greatest discrepancies relative to measurements in the 4.5-m aspen thicket under stable conditions, likely due to horizontal ejections from this relatively small patch of vegetation that could not be addressed by the one-dimensional model. At each site, the model performed best near the top of canopy where the air was well mixed and gradients between it the meteorological conditions above the canopy used to force the model were minimal.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, it has been suggested that the method is slow to capture transient changes in actual sap flux density due to heat storage and release within the stem. We show here how this may lead to biases in the estimation of the dynamics of sap flux density especially at low flow rates when thermal diffusivity is low. We also demonstrate how the traditional Granier sap flow method could be modified to improve the temporal precision of the sap flow measurement. In the new system, the temperature difference between the heated and the reference needle is kept constant by varying the heating power and the sap flux density is calculated from the power consumption. This leads to reduced changes in the heat content of stem. These modifications also make the method more robust in terms of stability of power supply and reduce power consumption during low flow conditions. The time dynamics of the Granier method and the new \u201csteady temperature method\u201d are simulated with a previously published numerical model of xylem heat balance and tested in a laboratory experiment with cut pieces of stem. The numerical model is also used to demonstrate that the relation between parameter <italic>K</italic>, calculated from instantaneous sensor temperature and maximum sensor temperature, and actual sap flux density is not constant for either the traditional Granier or the new modified sensor, but is dependent on the range of sapflow rates examined and on the value of thermal diffusivity.

Phenotypic variability in beech has been widely studied, but most of the investigations emphasize the variation between populations. The aim of this study was to explore phenotypic responses at the individual level within a beech population, comparing in a stand the annual phenological patterns as well as leaf area index (LAI) courses for three consecutive years (2010\u20132012). Thirty adult beech trees were randomly selected in a forest in southern Germany for which the seasonal pattern in LAI and different stages of leaf unfolding, leaf coloring and leaf fall were recorded biweekly/three times a week by hemispherical photographs and visual observations, respectively. Based on their phenological and LAI patterns we were able to analyze in detail the phenological variation of individual trees between seasons over a three year study. Our main results confirm that LAI based on hemispherical photographs was correlated with the ground phenological observations. Surprisingly, they suggest that the phenological patterns of individual beech trees compared to their stand neighbors were not necessarily fixed; instead they showed annually very plastic phenotypic responses. Not having a fixed phenological pattern may be a strategy to cope with a wide range of environmental conditions in an ever-changing climate.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168192315001586-fx1.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

Satellite data have been used to estimate incident shortwave radiation, but hardly to estimate all-wave net radiation due to the inference of clouds on longwave radiation. A practical solution is to estimate all-wave net radiation empirically from shortwave radiation and other ancillary information. Since existing models were developed using a limited number of ground observations, a comprehensive evaluation of these models using a global network of representative measurements is urgently required. In this study, we developed a new day-time net radiation estimation model and evaluated it against seven commonly used existing models using radiation measurements obtained from 326 sites around the world from 1991 to 2010. MERRA re-analysis products from which the meteorological data were derived and remotely sensed products during the same period were also used. Model evaluations were performed in both global mode (all data were used to fit the models) and conditional mode (the data were divided into four subsets based on the surface albedo and vegetation index, and the models were fitted separately). Besides, the factors (i.e., albedo, air temperature, and NDVI) that may impact the estimation of all-wave net radiation were also extensively explored. Based on these evaluations, the fitting RMSE of the new developed model was approximately 40.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Wm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> in the global mode and varied between 18.2 and 54.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Wm<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> in the conditional mode.

Comparison of results from these LES simulations with those for a canopy that is infinite and uniform in both streamwise and spanwise directions reveals important insights about the adjustment lengths for mean flow, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and canopy-shear-layer vortices. Two critical locations were identified in the flow adjustment at the leading edge: (1) the location at which canopy-shear-layer vortices begin to develop and (2) the location at which the flow is fully developed. Simulations were conducted for particles released from continuous point sources at four streamwise locations downwind from the leading edge and three heights within the canopy. The four streamwise source locations corresponded to the canopy leading edge, the location at which canopy-shear-layer vortices began to develop, the transition region, and the fully developed region. The adjustment of flow near the leading edge has a profound impact on the dispersion of particles close to the source, which is where most particle escape from the canopy takes place. Particles released close to the canopy leading edge have much higher maximum escape fractions than particles released in the fully developed region. The adjustment length for particle escape is greater than that for the flow. Away from the source (approximately sixteen canopy heights for the present dense canopy), the geometries of the mean plume become similar for particles released from different regions. Within a few tens of canopy heights from the leading edge, the growth rates of converged mean plume height and depth are lower than those for the case of an infinite canopy.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we propose a new multilayer scheme of ozone deposition on vegetation canopies that predicts stomatal, cuticular and soil deposition pathways separately. This mechanistic ozone deposition scheme is based on the multi-layer, multi-leaf mass and energy transfer model MuSICA. This model was chosen because it explicitly simulates the processes of rain interception, through fall and evaporation at different depths within the vegetation canopy, so that ozone deposition on wet leaf cuticles can be explicitly modelled with ozone dissolution, diffusion and chemical reaction inside the water films. The model was evaluated against a 3-year dataset of ozone, CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> and evapotranspiration flux measurements over a winter wheat field near Paris, France (ICOS Fr-GRI). Only periods with fully developed canopies (including senescence) were considered to minimise the contribution of soil deposition to the total ozone flux. Before senescence, the model could reproduce the measured ozone deposition rates as well as the CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> and water vapour fluxes. During senescence, large ozone deposition rates were observed under wet canopy conditions that could only be explained by first-order reaction rates in the water film of around 10<sup loc=\"post\">5</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>s<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>. Such reaction rates are not compatible with the chemical composition of rainwater. We therefore hypothesise that, during senescence, the cell content leaks out of the leaves when they become wet, exposing anti-oxidants to ozone. These results provide for the first time a mechanistic explanation of the commonly observed increase in ozone deposition rates during rain or dew formation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Borden Forest, one of the longest running flux towers in North America, is located in the temperate\u2013boreal ecotone. This transitional region, which includes species close to the limits of their environmental range, may be particularly susceptible to changes in forest composition as a result of climate change. Here we analyze net CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> exchange, measured using the eddy covariance method, and concurrent meteorological variables. The forest was found to be a low-to-moderate CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> sink, with uptake of 177<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>28<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>gC<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> (mean<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>standard error).

Ecosystem models are important tools that help us to understand and assess the impact of environmental changes in the NHLE. However, models lack processes that are essential for modeling ecosystem dynamics for the NHLEs. In this study, NHLE-specific dynamic phenology and dynamic rooting distribution and depth parameterizations was implemented in a land surface model, the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM), to improve the estimated carbon, water, and energy fluxes in the NHLs. These parameterizations account for light, water, and nutrient stresses while allocating the assimilated carbon to leaf, stem, and root pools. The model parameters related to these processes were calibrated and evaluated using measured data from 16 sites (12 fluxnet sites and 4 non-flux net sites) representative of the dominant NHLEs. By including these dynamic processes, ISAM was able to capture the measured seasonal variability in leaf area index (LAI) and root distribution in the soil layers. The evaluation of the model results suggested that without including the dynamic processes, the modeled growing season length (GSL) in the NHLE was almost two times higher, as compared to measurements. To quantify the implication of these processes on the C, water, and energy fluxes, we compared the results of two different versions of ISAM, a dynamic version that includes dynamic processes (ISAM<inf loc=\"post\">DYN</inf>) and a static version that does not include dynamic processes (ISAM<inf loc=\"post\">BC</inf>), with measurements from 12 eddy covariance flux sites. The results showed that ISAM<inf loc=\"post\">DYN</inf>, unlike ISAM<inf loc=\"post\">BC</inf>, was more capable to capture the flux site-based seasonal variability in GPP, water, and energy fluxes. Regional analysis revealed that the growing season length increased on average by about 5 days in the NHLs in the 2000s compared to 1990s.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Most research on dispersion in plant canopies has focused on dispersal patterns in homogeneous dense canopies and/or on patterns far from the source. To study near-source particle dispersion in a sparse agricultural canopy, a series of point-source particle release events was conducted in a commercial vineyard. Analysis of the wind velocity data indicated that the majority of the flow in the open spaces between the vine rows was channeled parallel to the vine rows regardless of the direction of the mean wind above the canopy. Although this channeling led to significant turning of the mean velocity, profiles of turbulent statistics taken at times when the above-canopy winds were nearly parallel to the vine rows showed similar behavior to canopy flow profiles in previous studies. The particle release events were conducted using fluorescent microspheres with similar physical characteristics to the spores of multiple airborne fungal pathogens of grapes (diameter = 10\u201345<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcm, density = 1.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g/cm<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>). Microspheres were released from two vertical positions within the canopy and monitored using a dense three dimensional impaction trap array in the near-source region (1\u20135 canopy heights downwind). The shape of the microsphere plumes was strongly impacted by the flow channeling within the canopy. Specifically, the plumes\u2019 maximum concentrations were typically channelled down the aisle in which they originated. The spanwise concentration profile also tended to be skewed from the release aisle toward the mean wind direction above the canopy. This was believed to be caused by the wind directional shear created by the difference between the mean wind direction above the canopy and the vine row direction as well as the filtering effects of the plants themselves.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we analysed the occurrence of last frost (days with minimum temperature under 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C) and first heat (days with maximum temperatures exceeding 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C) events of the year to determine the optimum flowering date in the wheat belt of New South Wales (NSW), eastern Australia. We used statistically downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature data from 19 Global Climate Models (GCMs) with a vernalizing\u2013photothermal model in order to simulate future flowering dates and the changes in frost and hot days occurrence at flowering date (\u00b1 7 days) for two future scenarios for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in 2040s (2021\u20132060) and 2080s (2061\u20132100). Relative to the 1961\u20132000 period, the GCMs projected increased daily maximum and minimum temperatures for these future periods, accompanied by reduced frost occurrence and increased heat stress incidence. As a consequence, by the 2080s, simulations suggest a general advance in spring wheat flowering date by, on average, 10.2 days for RCP4.5 and 17.8 days for RCP8.5 across the NSW wheat belt. Winter wheat flowering dates were delayed by an average of 2.4 days for RCP4.5 and 14.3 days for RCP8.5 in the warmest parts of the region (the northwest) due to reduced cumulative vernalization days (requiring cool conditions). In the cooler regions (the northeast, southeast and southwest), flowering date occurred earlier by 6.2 days for RCP4.5 and 6.7 days for RCP8.5 on average. Moreover, in the western parts of the wheat belt the delay of winter wheat flowering date was about 9.5 days longer than that in the eastern parts. As a result of phenological responses to increasing temperatures, current wheat varieties may not be suitable for future climate conditions, despite reduced frost risk. In the future, it may be necessary to use longer-season wheat varieties and varieties with increased heat-stress resistance.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The study was carried out over four years (2010\u20132013) corresponding to the first two rotations of the plantation.

The temporal dynamics and the magnitude of the ratio between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R<inf loc=\"post\">eco</inf>) were similar to a deciduous forest. The evolution of LAI showed values ranging from 0.96 (\u00b10.4) to 2.0 (\u00b11.2) and from 5.1 (\u00b11.5) to 4.5 (\u00b10.84) during the first and the second rotation, respectively. The GPP (measured close to light saturation) was significantly related to LAI (<italic>r</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> of 0.76, <italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.001). The cumulative evapotranspiration (ET) measured during the first rotation was 241.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm and 349.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm for 2010 and 2011, respectively, and 464.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm and 372.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm for 2012 and 2013.

The mean decoupling factors (\u03a9) were 0.35 and 0.23 for the foliated and unfoliated periods, respectively, indicating that ET was primarily controlled by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and <italic>G<inf loc=\"post\">s</inf> </italic> (a well-coupled system). The mean Priestley\u2013Taylor coefficient (<italic>\u03b1</italic>) was 0.77 and 0.53 for the foliated and the unfoliated periods, respectively. Such low values indicate that ET was significantly lower than the equilibrium evaporation and thus also lower than the ET of a hypothetical reference crop.

This method has been demonstrated to be applicable to deciduous forests, but few studies have used this method for estimating seasonal variations of LAI in mixed evergreen\u2013deciduous forests. In this study, we proposed a practical method to estimate the seasonal variation of LAI directly by combining leaf emergent seasonality and litterfall collection (defined as LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf>) in a mixed broadleaved-Korean pine (<italic>Pinus koraiensis</italic>) forest (BK), a Korean pine plantation (KP), a spruce\u2013fir valley forest (SV), and a secondary birch (<italic>Betula platyphylla</italic>) forest (SB). In this direct method, the seasonal variation of LAI in a mixed forest can be quantified by tracking leaf growth and fall patterns throughout the growing season for each major evergreen and deciduous species. Using the LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf> as a reference, we validated optical LAI (effective LAI, <italic>L<inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> </italic>) measurements through a digital hemispherical photography (DHP) and the LAI-2000 instrument. We also explored the contribution of major sources of errors to optical LAI, including woody-to-total area ratio (<italic>\u03b1</italic>), clumping index (<italic>\u03a9</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">E</inf>), needle-to-shoot area ratio (\u03b3<inf loc=\"post\">E</inf>) and automatic exposure (<italic>E</italic>). We determined that DHP <italic>L<inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> </italic> significantly (<italic>P</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) underestimated LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf> from May to November by 48\u201364% in BK, KP and SV but overestimated LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf> by 7% on average in SB. Similarly, LAI-2000 <italic>L<inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> </italic> also significantly (<italic>P</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) underestimated LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf> by an average of 27\u201335% in BK, KP and SV but overestimated LAI<inf loc=\"post\">dir</inf> by 22% on average in SB. The relative contribution of <italic>E</italic> to the error in DHP <italic>L<inf loc=\"post\">e</inf> </italic> is larger than other factors, and the <italic>\u03b3</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">E</inf> was the largest relative contributor to the underestimation of LAI by LAI-2000. The results from our study demonstrate that seasonal variations of LAI in mixed evergreen\u2013deciduous forests can be optically estimated with high accuracy (85% for DHP and 91% for LAI-2000), as long as accurate corrections are made to the various factors mentioned above. These close agreements between direct and optical LAI results also suggest that the direct method developed in this study is useful for tracking the seasonal variation of LAI in mixed forests.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In many regions, however, daily weather data of sufficient quality and duration are not available. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated a new method to create long-term weather series based on a few years of observed daily temperature data (hereafter called propagated data). The propagated data are comprised of uncorrected gridded solar radiation from the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA\u2013POWER), rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset, and location-specific calibration of NASA\u2013POWER <italic>T</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">max</inf> and <italic>T</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">min</inf> using a limited amount of observed daily temperature data. The distributions of simulated yields of maize, rice, or wheat with propagated data were compared with simulated yields using observed weather data at 18 sites in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Other sources of weather data typically used in crop modeling for locations without long-term observed weather data were also included in the comparison: (i) uncorrected NASA\u2013POWER weather data and (ii) generated weather data using the MarkSim weather generator. Results indicated good agreement between yields simulated with propagated weather data and yields simulated using observed weather data. For example, the distribution of simulated yields using propagated data was within 10% of the simulated yields using observed data at 78% of locations and degree of yield stability (quantified by coefficient of variation) was very similar at 89% of locations. In contrast, simulated yields based entirely on uncorrected NASA\u2013POWER data or generated weather data using MarkSim were within 10% of yields simulated using observed data in only 44 and 33% of cases, respectively, and the bias was not consistent across locations and crops. We conclude that, for most locations, 3 years of observed daily <italic>T</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">max</inf> and <italic>T</italic> <inf loc=\"post\">min</inf> data would allow creation of a robust weather data set for simulation of long-term mean yield and yield stability of major cereal crops.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
