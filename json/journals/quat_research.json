Sp\u00f6rer and Maunder minima in solar activity may be indicated by further declines in Br and enrichment in easily degradable compounds such as polysaccharides. Peat organic matter composition was also influenced by vegetation changes at the end of the LIA when the expansion of oceanic heath was associated with polysaccharide enrichment. Atmospheric lead pollution was recorded in the peat after ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>AD 1845, and peak values occurred in the 1970s.

Our results indicate that, contrary to our initial expectations, glacier change throughout the study region cannot be explained readily by correlations in glacier location, size, or shape. Because of the large error attributable to annual variations in glacier area due to snowpack, no statistically reliable change could be detected for 444 glaciers in our study (a slight majority). Of the North Cascades glaciers that do exhibit detectable change, a majority decreased in area, but nevertheless, some were detectably growing. These findings suggest that the integration of weather patterns over time does not neatly translate into correlations with natural variations in the geometry of glaciers. Our statistical analyses of the changes observed indicate that geometric data from a large number of glaciers, as well as a surprisingly large amount of spatial change, are required for a credible statistical detection of glacier-length and area changes over a short (multidecadal) period of time.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Using calcrete profiles from four river terraces of the Rio Alias in southeast Spain, this study explores the potential of using detailed micromorphological and stable isotopic analysis to more fully understand the impacts of Quaternary environmental change on calcrete development. The four profiles increase in carbonate complexity with progressive age, reflecting calcretisation over multiple glacial\u2013interglacial cycles since MIS 9 (c. 300<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka). Calcrete profiles contain a mixture of Alpha (non-biogenic) and Beta (biogenic) microfabrics. Alpha fabrics have higher \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C and \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values. The profiles contain a range of crystal textures, but there is little difference between the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C and \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values of spar, microspar, and micrite cements. Strong positive covariance between \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C and \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O suggests that both isotopes are responding to the same environmental parameter, which is inferred to be relative aridity. The study reveals that the detailed co-analysis of calcrete micromorphology and stable isotope signatures can allow patterns of calcrete formation to be placed into a wider palaeoclimatic context. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to more reliably constrain the palaeoenvironmental significance of secondary carbonates in dryland settings where other proxy records may be poorly preserved.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we establish a lake-level chronology of Tangra Yum Co (fifth largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau) based on luminescence dating of feldspar from 17 beach-ridge samples. The samples were collected from two strandplains southeast and north of the lake and range in elevation from the current shore to 140<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the present lake. Using a modified post-infrared IRSL protocol at 170\u00b0C we successfully minimised the anomalous fading in the feldspar IRSL signal, and obtained reliable dating results. The luminescence ages indicate three different stages of lake-level decline during the Holocene: (1) a phase of rapid decline (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m) from ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>6.4 to ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, (2) a period of slow decline between ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>4.5 and ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>20<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m), and (3) a fast decline by 70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m between ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and today.

Fossils afford a way to investigate distributional shifts in individual species, and thus improve our understanding of long-term change in Neotropical bird communities. We report a species-rich avian fossil sample from a late Pleistocene tar seep (Mene de Inciarte) in northwestern Venezuela. A mere 175 identified fossils from Mene de Inciarte represent 73 species of birds, among which six are extinct, and eight others no longer occur within 100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km. These 14 species consist mainly of ducks (Anatidae), snipe (Scolopacidae), vultures/condors (Vulturidae), hawks/eagles (Accipitridae), and blackbirds (Icteridae). Neotropical bird communities were richer in the late Pleistocene than today; their considerable extinction may be related to collapse of the large mammal fauna at that time. The species assemblage at Mene de Inciarte suggests that biogeographic patterns, even at continental scales, have been remarkably labile over short geological time frames. Mene de Inciarte is but one of 300<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>+ tar seeps in Venezuela, only two of which have been explored for fossils.

Although global forces are at play, the effects of sea-level rise are highly localized due to variability in glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) effects. Interpretations of coastal paleoecology and archeology require reliable estimates of ancient shorelines that account for GIA effects. Here we build on previous models for California's Northern Channel Islands, producing more accurate late Pleistocene and Holocene paleogeographic reconstructions adjusted for regional GIA variability. This region has contributed significantly to our understanding of early New World coastal foragers. Sea level that was about 80\u201385<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m lower than present at the time of the first known human occupation brought about a landscape and ecology substantially different than today. During the late Pleistocene, large tracts of coastal lowlands were exposed, while a colder, wetter climate and fluctuating marine conditions interacted with rapidly evolving littoral environments.

The results show that taxon-specific responses to the climate variables display a wide regional diversity and that the climate variables with low collinearity that best account for the spatial variability of modern pollen assemblages differ regionally. PANN is the most important variable in northwestern and northeastern China and the Tibetan Plateau, while MTWA and MTCO are the dominant variables in east-central and southern China.

The averaged seawater temperature seasonality around 2165<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>75 BC (4.46<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>1.41\u00b0C, derived from the data of 18<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr) were similar to the seasonality of recent decade (4.41<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.82\u00b0C during AD 1994\u20132005), but the temperature seasonality around AD 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>40 (3.69<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>1.37\u00b0C, derived from the data of 48<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr) and AD 990<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>40 (3.64<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.87\u00b0C, derived from the data of 11<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr) was significantly lower than that during AD 1994\u20132005. The reduced seasonality around AD 990<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>40 was attributable to the unusually warm winter during the medieval times, probably caused by the weakening of East Asian Winter Monsoon.

Both the pollen concentrations and other proxy indices, including sediment grain size, total organic carbon contents (TOC), and elemental contents (e.g., Fe, Al), clearly indicate a long term decreasing trend in ISM intensity over the late Holocene. During the period from approximately AD 750 to AD 1200, pollen concentrations of conifer and broadleaf trees, and herbs reached the lowest levels over the past ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>3500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr; while the pollen percentages of both herbs and broadleaf trees increased, suggesting a significant medieval drought. The grain size, TOC, and elemental contents also support an arid climate during the medieval period. The Little Ice Age (LIA) at Lake Erhai was characterized as cold and wet. The medieval and LIA climatic patterns at Lake Erhai were similar to those over most of the ISM areas, but anti-phase with those over East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) areas. We suspect that sea surface temperature variations in the Indo-Pacific oceans and the related land-sea thermal contrasts may be responsible for such hydroclimatic differences between EASM and ISM areas.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
