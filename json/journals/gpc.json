Marsili Seamount (MS) represents the axial ridge of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea back-arc basin, which is connected to the slab roll-backing processes affecting the Calabrian Arc (Italy). The Southern Tyrrhenian Sea back-arc is characterized by a significant decline in the spreading rate with time (2.8\u20133.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm/a to less than 1.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm/a in the last 0.78\u20131<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma). MS develops between about 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma and 3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and mainly consists of lava flows erupted from central and fissural vents. The MS products belong to the calcalkaline association and range in composition from basalts to trachytes. We present new stratigraphic, geochronological, and geochemical data (glass shards and minerals) of tephra from a 2.35<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m long gravity core (Marsili1 core) recovered on MS at 943<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m b.s.l. We recognize five tephras [M1 (top of the core) to M5 (bottom)] represented by poorly to highly vesiculated ashes. The lowermost tephra M5 emplaced between ca. 7 and 26<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka B.P.; it represents the less evolved distal counterpart of the Unit D related to the Biancavilla\u2013Montalto products of Mount Etna (Sicily). The M1 to M4 tephras emplaced between 2.1 and 7.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka B.P. and are related to strombolian-like submarine eruptions of NNE\u2013SSW aligned MS vents. The composition of the M1\u2013M4 glasses ranges from basaltic trachyandesites to andesites and trachytes. The M1 to M4 magmas mainly originated by crystal fractionation from a heterogeneous mantle source with varying LILE enrichments by subduction-related fluids. The degree of evolution of the MS magmas increases with decreasing time. The formation of vertically stacked magma storage zones at the crust/mantle interface and within MS is related to the vanishing Southern Tyrrhenian Sea opening, which implies the rapid (&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma) evolution from a slow spreading back-arc setting to an arc system.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921818115001459-fx1.jpg\" height=\"192\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

Sea level anomalies (SLAs) in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are assumed to be governed by various phenomena associated with the adjacent parts of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. We have used monthly sea level anomalies obtained from 12 tide gauge stations of PSMSL and UHSLC and merged and gridded AVISO products of SLAs (sea level anomalies) derived from satellite altimeter. We find that IOD-influenced inter-annual variations are found only in the southwestern and southeastern coastal regions of SSCS. Our analysis reveals that inter-annual regional sea level drops are associated with positive phase of the IOD, and the rises with negative phase of the IOD. SLA variations at decadal scale in the southeastern and northern Gulf of Thailand correlate with Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO). Multiple linear regression analysis of inter-annual SLAs and climate indices shows that IOD induced inter-annual variations dominate in the southwestern SCS and it contributes to about ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40% of inter-annual sea level variation. Meanwhile, ENSO contributes to around ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30% variation in sea level in the southwestern and ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40% variation in the southeastern SSCS. The present study also suggests that inter-annual SLA variations in the SSCS can occur by ENSO and IOD induced changes in wind stress curl and volume transport variations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Assemblage variations are interpreted in terms of paleoclimate and paleoproductivity proxies. The pattern of C<inf loc=\"post\">37</inf> alkenones is also presented as an additional indicator of primary paleoproductivity.

A new benthic and planktonic \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C dataset is also shown. The coccolithophore abundance mirrors the Ca/Ti pattern indicating that coccolith-derived carbonate is the dominant contributor to carbonate production in the studied interval. The distinct increase in the coccolithophore abundance, as well as in the accumulation rate, occurring at the MIS 14/13 transition, reflects the beginning of the worldwide-scale mid-Brunhes blooming of <italic>Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica</italic> and triggers the increase in carbonate production imprinted on the Ca/Ti profile. Interglacials are marked by enhanced abundances of the coccolithophore warm water group (wwt group) that also displays high frequency variability related to precessional/insolation forcing. Warmest surface water conditions are recorded during MIS 15, suggesting an intensified contribution of the subtropical AzC, essentially during MIS 15.5 and 15.1. Reduced productivity in these intervals is in agreement with a major influence of nutrient-poor and less ventilated subtropical waters. On the other hand, productive and mixed surface water conditions can be inferred during MIS 13 in agreement with other North Atlantic records. A long lasting period of warm, stratified and oligotrophic waters is inferred during MIS 11.3, indicating a continuous and more persistent influence of subtropical waters at the site location.

Here, we examine the functional diversity of a Middle Triassic paleocommunity in the wake of the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, the Permo-Triassic mass extinction (PTME). Field data was collected and analyzed for a highly diverse invertebrate marine fossil assemblage, the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Leidapo Member (Qingyan Formation) of Qingyan, south China. Previously interpreted to represent a fully restructured paleocommunity in the aftermath of the PTME, our results indicate that the fauna of Leidapo Member had high taxonomic diversity and high functional richness, however was functionally uneven. Despite the presence of 24 different functional groups, the paleocommunity was numerically and ecologically dominated by one functional group consisting of mostly attached epifaunal suspension feeding brachiopods. The overwhelming dominance of this Anisian paleocommunity by one functional group implies that either, 1) resource availability in the community was uneven, and/or 2) strong environmental or niche filtering was in effect. As such, while the Anisian Leidapo Member paleocommunity was deposited in a fairly stable shallow water paleoenvironment, this biotic assemblage would have been very vulnerable to biotic and environmental perturbations. While it is uncertain whether or not this pattern is typical of paleocommunities in the aftermath of the PTME, these results imply that some Anisian paleocommunities may not have been as fully restructured as previously thought, and may have been inherently unstable due to the numerous biotic and environmental changes present in the Triassic.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Both fungi hyphae and protein production in soils are affected by perturbations related to land-use changes, implying that GRSP is a sensitive indicator of soil quality. Unfortunately, GRSP degrades within years to decades in oxic environments, preventing its use as palaeoecological proxy. However, GRSP is transported to marine, near-shore anoxic sediments, where it accumulates and remains non-degraded, enabling the assessment of its potential as a palaeoecological proxy for soil ecosystem's health. Exploiting this fact, we have obtained for the first time a long-term record (c. 1250<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years) of GRSP content using a <italic>Posidonia oceanica</italic> seagrass mat sediment core from the Western Mediterranean (Portlligat Bay, Spain). The trends in GRSP content matched well with land-use changes related to agrarian activities reconstructed by pollen analysis. In periods of cultivation, GRSP accumulation in the mat decreased. Given the role played by GRSP, the results suggest that agrarian intensification may have resulted in perturbations to soil quality. Thus, GRSP in seagrass mat sediments can be used to assess long-term trends in continental soil quality induced by human activities. These findings open new possibilities in long-term ecology research, as other anoxic environments could be potentially valid too. Testing them would open the possibility to identify long-term patterns in soil quality and other environmental stressors that could also affect AMF and GRSP production in soils.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Therefore, the peninsula is particularly sensitive to climate change owing to frequent periods of precipitation deficit together with societal dependence on water. In this study, we address meteorological droughts of the peninsula between 1901 and 2010, using the Global Precipitation Climatology Center database. First, we carried out a statistical classification of the peninsula according to annual precipitation cycle. The spatiotemporal variability of droughts was evaluated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) by determining the evolution of areas affected by severe and extreme drought. Subsequently, we calculated the overall trend of precipitation and anomalies to investigate whether an observed drought increase is attributable to a decrease of precipitation or an increase of precipitation extremes. Finally, we examined periodicities of precipitation anomalies via wavelet analysis, relating these to large-scale modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results show an increase in the area affected by severe and extreme drought, particularly on Atlantic-facing slopes. The mainland areas have longer and more intense periods of drought, with an average SPI of \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>0.52 and 4-month duration. Over the 110<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years analyzed, we observed weak trends of annual precipitation in the extreme northwest and southern IP. However, in the last decades of the series, long periods of strong negative anomalies are seen, interspersed with years of strong positive anomalies, suggesting an increase in precipitation pattern extremes. Finally, the relationship between the NAO index and precipitation anomalies on the Atlantic seaboard is highlighted. Thus, in both series we found a 5\u20136-year periodicity in their first years, with a diminishing cycle period reaching a periodicity of 2\u20133<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years in the final years. This confirms the existence of regular temporal cycles in which droughts alternate with wet periods modulated by large-scale modes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Moreover, relatively intense changes occurred in the high percentile ranges for both TX and TN. The total amount of precipitation on wet days decreased over a large area of the Loess Plateau, particularly in the southeast region. The inequality in the spread of precipitation over the year (temporal inequality) increased extensively over the past fifty years in the wet region.

The proportion of days with light or moderate precipitation was decreased in the wet region which mainly located in the southwest of the Loess Plateau, but there were only minor changes in extreme precipitation events. Overall, when both temperature and precipitation changes were combined, we observed that the southwest of the Loess Plateau has undergone the largest degree of climate change.

The reconstructed records were significantly and positively correlated with All Indian Precipitation records (<italic>r</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.32, <italic>n</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>132, <italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.001) and with a proxy of the Indian summer monsoon. These findings suggest that a persistent teleconnection exists between the reconstructed record and the Indian summer monsoon records from the past 225<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years. The observed interannual synchronisation potentially resulted from the transport of partial water vapour from the Indian summer monsoon area to NC; however, this synchronisation could not be attributed to the El Nino-South Oscillation (ENSO). When considering an interdecadal time scale, the synchronisation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has varied since 1779, implying that the NAO may serve as an additional atmospheric pattern that affects this teleconnection.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We also evaluated whether facilitation among neighboring shrubs, as inferred from spatial analyses, influenced shrubline dynamics.

Independent, long-term summer temperature reconstructions also were associated with shrub recruitment. Point-pattern analyses were used to characterize spatial patterns of different size classes of shrubs. The three shrublines showed little long-term changes despite ongoing warming; no upward shift has occurred in the past 100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years. Recruitment was negatively associated with summer temperatures and drought occurrence since the 1920s. Spatial patterns were characterized by clustering at local scales and attraction between the different size classes, suggesting facilitation.

However, a sequence of Lower Triassic shallow-water carbonate rocks has been documented from the region, indicating the existence of isolated seamount carbonate platforms in the basin. The seamount carbonate platform sediments differ from synchronous deep basin flysch sediments, and consist of shallow-water oncoids, ooids and cortoids. Microfacies studies reveal that the oncoids have a thick cortex comprised of irregular, non-concentric and partially overlapping micritic laminae and contain abundant well-preserved foraminifera, indicating a relatively low-energy environment in subtidal settings. Ooids exhibit thinner and more regular concentric laminations, which are interpreted to have formed by frequent overgrowth while rolling in a relatively high-energy setting. Cortoids are predominantly composed of tiny fossil fragments and intraclasts with a micritic envelope, indicating a shallow-marine warm water environment located in the intertidal or supertidal zone. Ooids in the Bayan Har area differ from those found on stable platforms, in that they sometimes nucleated onto volcanic quartz grains, reflecting an unstable tectonic setting that was frequently affected by volcanic activity. Widespread ooids and other microbial carbonates formed in the Early Triassic have been regarded anachronistic facies that are indicative of harsh marine conditions. Most Lower Triassic anachronistic facies are distributed along the shallow margin of the Tethys Ocean and the western margin of Pangea; however, Bayan Har was located in the center of the Palaeo-Tethys.

Through a production of increasingly precise chronologies, the broadening range of sediment dating methods in recent years has improved our understanding of correlations between alluvial dynamics and external forcing mechanisms. However, results in this field have mostly focused on periglacial and other mid-latitude settings. These may not readily apply to glaciofluvial environments, where alluvial regimes are narrowly dependent on the behavior of the adjacent ice-field. Here we constrain the ages of three glaciofluvial fill terraces based on five vertical <sup loc=\"pre\">10</sup>Be age profiles in the Ari\u00e8ge River catchment, and produce a chronofunction of related contrasts in terrace tread topsoil characteristics. Each profile consists of 9 to 11 gravel samples collected over depths of 4.6 to 15<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. Terrace T1 (+<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>15<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the current riverbed) was sampled at ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>4, 22 and 53<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km downstream from the Last Glacial Maximum terminal moraine system of the Ari\u00e8ge outlet glacier.

Prior to this, aggradation occurred from MIS 4 to the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), i.e.,under maximum ice extent conditions, and lasted a few thousand years thereafter. The protracted influx of debris after the LGM was sustained by paraglacial storage release in the catchment and promoted by strong coupling between slope and channel processes. Fluvial incision of T1 occurred during the post-LGMcold-to-warm transition after a time (supported by paleobotanical evidence) when the vegetation cover was capable of ensuring catchment-wide slope stability.

We employed both the linear methods of correlation and response function analyses, and the nonlinear method of the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). Most trees are sensitive to the moisture availability. Old trees are more sensitive to drought than young trees, which may be related to the intensified hydraulic resistances and reduced photosynthesis in response to drought. Tree cores taken from the southern direction are often more sensitive to drought than cores taken from other directions. The enhanced drought sensitivity for the southern cores may be possibly related to more branches and leaves for photosynthesis. Slow-growing trees show higher correlations with precipitation of the September prior to growth. This indicates that the extremely stressed, slow-growing trees tend to rely largely on nutrients produced prior to the growing season. For the reconstructions of annual drought in this region, we suggest collecting tree cores from the southern side of old trees growing at stressed sites.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Nine &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m oscillations in water level were documented between ca. 15 and 4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka.

Lake level increased to at least 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, post Younger Dryas cooling. Water level fell by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m by 10.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, with another potential rise at ca. 8.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka to &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above current level. Lake level regressed by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m at 8.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka coincident with cooling in the equatorial eastern Atlantic Ocean. Two major &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m lake level oscillations centered at 6.6 and 5.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka may reflect enhanced convection with warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean.

This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana. Also, for this closed lake basin excesses and deficits in water input are amplified with a cascading lake effect in the East African Rift Valley and through the Chew Bahir Basin.

Benthic foraminifer concentration in the sediments and variations of the planktonic foraminifer assemblages suggest significant changes in surface productivity and food supply to the sea floor since the ending of MIS 13 to the end of MIS 11 that could be correlated with the registered changes in facies and trace fossil assemblages.

Our previous study (Parr and Wang 2014) examines the impact of climate changes during 1950\u20132011 on hydrological processes in the Northeast using the CRB as a case study. Our results showed a clear increase of precipitation intensity and suggested that the basin is entering a wetter regime more subject to meteorological flood conditions than to drought conditions. For this future analysis, three North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) models are used to derive the meteorological forcing for the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model (VIC), using both present day and the future projected A1B scenario climate. Our future projections indicate wetter winters including significantly greater precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture, decreases to spring runoff, and enhanced ET for all four seasons. We also find a shift toward earlier and faster snow melting and an earlier date of peak discharge. Future precipitation extremes show a decreased amount compared to the early 21st Century, but increased when compared to our entire historic period or the late 20th Century, as well as a consistently increasing mean intensity throughout the past and future. Analyses of extreme hydrologic events reveals changing characteristics of flooding involving increasing duration but decreasing frequency of flood events as well as a reduction of drought risk.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The 5x2 km large and 26 m deep lake is of proglacial origin and situated on the eastern flank of Sredinny Ridge at the northwestern end of the Central Kamchatka Valley, outside the direct influence of active volcanism. Here, we present results of a multi-proxy study on sediment cores, spanning about the last 7000 years. The general tenor of the TYL record is an increase in continentality and winter snow cover in conjunction with a decrease in temperature, humidity, and biological productivity after 5000<italic>\u2013</italic>4500 cal yrs BP, inferred from pollen and diatom data and the isotopic composition of organic carbon. The TYL proxy data also show that the late Holocene was punctuated by two colder spells, roughly between 4500 and 3500 cal yrs BP and between 1000 and 200 cal yrs BP, as local expressions of the Neoglacial and Little Ice Age, respectively. These environmental changes can be regarded as direct and indirect responses to climate change, as also demonstrated by other records in the regional terrestrial and marine realm. Long-term climate deterioration was driven by decreasing insolation, while the short-term climate excursions are best explained by local climatic processes. The latter affect the configuration of atmospheric pressure systems that control the sources as well as the temperature and moisture of air masses reaching Kamchatka.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The undated basal part of record before ca. 9600 yrs BP, however, does not reflect properly cold conditions. At that time, although shrublands and tundra dominated, stone birch and white birch forests have already settled in surroundings; the presence of alder woodland indicates wet and maritime-like climate. The subsequent forest advance suggesting warmer conditions was interrupted by the ca. 8000-7600 yrs BP spell of cooler climate. The following culmination of warmth is bracketed by the evidence of the first maximal forest extent between ca. 7400 and 5100 yrs BP. During that time, dramatic retreat of alder forest suggests a turn from maritime-like to more continental climate conditions. The cool and wet pulse after ca. 5100 yrs BP was pronounced as forests retreat while shrublands, meadows and bogs extended. An expansion of white birch forest since ca. 3500 yrs BP reflected the onset of drier climate, strengthening continentality and seasonal contrast. The second maximum of forests dominated by both stone and white birches occurred between ca. 2200 and 1700 yrs BP and indicated warming in association with relatively dry and increasingly continental climate. The following period was wetter and cooler, and minor outbreak of alder forest around ca. 1500 yrs BP suggests a short-term return of maritime-like conditions. Since ca. 1300 yrs BP forests retreated and replaced by shrublands, tundra and bogs, pointing to cool and wet climate and likely increased back continentality. A prominent re-advance of stone birch forest shown atop the record, most probably reflect recent warming trend.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">The reconstructed cool periods correlate well with Holocene glacial advances in neighboring mountain areas and with the tree ring and ice core records from the Central Kamchatka Depression.

However, in some cases the environmental variables estimated from mammals are biassed by local influences. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Granada Basin (southern Spain) based on carbon and oxygen isotopes from enamel rodent teeth is compared with the palaeoenvironmental data from small mammal assemblages. Estimated temperatures from both proxies coincide, in general terms: cold-temperate conditions during the latest Tortonian (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C; cold-temperate climate), dry sub-tropical conditions during the Messinian (16.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C\u201322<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C), and dry sub-tropical conditions during the early Pliocene (16.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C\u201317.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C). Reconstructed humidity trends from both proxies only agree in the first part of the record, showing dry conditions during the Tortonian\u2013Messinian boundary and an increase in humidity at the beginning of the Messinian. During the Messinian and earliest Pliocene, humidity trends in each proxy are frequently opposed: small mammal assemblages suggest a huge increase in humidity at the beginning of the Messinian, and a decreasing trend towards the Pliocene, whereas carbon isotopes from rodent teeth suggest moderate humidity conditions during the Messinian. It can be concluded that physical changes in the landscape would affect taxa with high dependence on humid conditions, and they are more likely to record local environmental humidity changes rather than regional or global humidity ones. However, the past reconstructions of temperatures are not biassed by this effect, as the general temperature trends deduced from the faunal assemblages as well as those deduced from the isotopic approaches coincide. The general climatic trends reconstructed from isotopic analyses in small mammal teeth agree with the general environmental change in the western Mediterranean region as well as with the global evolution of sea temperatures.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921818115000855-fx1.jpg\" height=\"199\" width=\"178\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

One of the most conspicuous features of this basin is the organic-rich nature of most of the Margaritatus Chronozone hemipelagic deposits, with the occurrence of several well-defined regional black shales. The analysis of selected redox sensitive elements (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Mo, and U) from the worldwide reference section of Peniche indicates that in this basin most of the organic-rich facies of the Ibex\u2013Margaritatus chronozones were deposited under an oxic\u2013dysoxic regime, while the rare centimetre thick well-defined black shales were deposited and preserved under suboxic\u2013anoxic, intermittently euxinic conditions. Based on the integration of sedimentological, biostratigraphical, geochemical, and organic petrographic evidence we suggest that these basinwide black shales, corresponding to widespread mucilage and microbial outbreaks, were driven by extreme climate warming coupled with high oceanic productivity and intermittently stratified epeiric seas. Regionally, these \u201chot snaps\u201d may have promoted the observed rapid but short-lived expansion of Tethyan ammonites into Boreal domains or led to decrease benthic diversity.

In this study, flood- and drought-affected, flood- and drought-damaged crop areas, and also flood- and drought-induced agricultural loss from 29 provinces across China are analyzed in both space and time. Results indicate the following: (1) Large parts of China are dominated by intensified floods. Comparatively, spatial ranges dominated by intensifying drought hazards are smaller than those by intensifying flood hazards. (2) Drought intensity is increasing in northwest China with moderate changes in the degree of influence. Increasing flood intensity can be observed in northwest, southwest and central China. However, flood risks are higher in arid regions such as northwest China and drought risks are higher in humid regions such as southwest China. (3) Agreements are identified between abrupt behaviors of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas. The change points of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas is in the 1980s in northeast, north and central China and in the 1990s in south and southwest China. Nevertheless, spatial patterns of the change points in the drought-affected and -destroyed crop areas are sporadic but not confirmative. (4) Flood- and drought-induced losses of agricultural production have significant increasing trends in most parts of China. The loss rate and loss magnitude of agriculture before change points are significantly higher than those after change points. (5) Generally, amplifications of precipitation extremes, decreasing consecutive wet days and increasing consecutive dry days in both space and time are the major driving factors behind the changes of drought- and flood-affected, and -destroyed crop areas and their impacts on agriculture across China. These results are theoretically and practically relevant for planning and management of agricultural activities and may help provide a theoretical framework for similar studies in other regions of the globe.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Based on an analysis of the forest change history of China, we devised a reconstruction method for the historical forest cover in China. The core idea of the method is that the lands with high suitability for cultivation will be cultivated and deforested first, spreading to marginal lands with lower suitability for cultivation. By determining the possible maximum distribution extent of the forest, as well as devising the land suitability for cultivation assessment model and provincial forest area allocation model, we created 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km forest cover maps of China for the years 1700 to 2000 with 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>year intervals. By comparison with satellite-based data in 2000, we found that the grids within 25% differences account for as much as 66.07% of all grids. The comparison with the historical documents-based data in northeast China indicated that the number of counties within 30% relative differences is 99, accounting for 74.44% of all counties. Therefore, the forest area allocation model we devised can accurately reproduce the spatial patterns of historical forest cover in China. Our reconstruction indicates that from 1700 to the 1960s, the deforestation mainly occurred in southwest China, the hilly regions of south China, the southeast of Gansu province, and northeast China; from the 1960s to 2000, the reforestation occurred in most traditional forested regions of China, particularly in the Tibet Plateau, hilly regions of south China and the Greater Khingan Mountains. The spatially explicit forest cover data sets we reconstructed can be used in global or regional climatic models to study the impact of land cover change on climate change.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we reported a 168-year tree-ring width chronology from a steep, low-elevation site with thin soil layers in the Xianxia Mountains, southeastern China. Contrary to the existing chronologies that are mostly temperature sensitive, this chronology contained a strong February\u2013April precipitation signal, indicating great potential for tree-ring based precipitation reconstructions in southeastern China. The reconstruction explained 47.8% of the instrumental variance during 1951\u20132012.

Previous rock magnetic investigations pointed out that the magnetic enhancement in Romanian loess sequences is mainly due to pedogenic magnetite close to superparamagnetic/stable single domain boundary. We report the first reconstruction of grain size distribution (GSD) of the superparamagnetic (SP) particles for two Romanian loess deposits, Costine\u015fti and Mircea Vod\u0103, located in the Dobrogea Plateau between the Danube River and the Black Sea. The GSDs were obtained using both the wide-band frequency spectrum of magnetic susceptibility (FSMS) method and low temperature M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The FSMS method shows that the SP particles are present both in loess and paleosols. The GSDs in loess are shifted to slightly higher diameters with respect to paleosols. The concentration of SP particles has an opposite trend. The largest value is reached in the forest paleosol and the lowest in the loess samples. Both loess and paleosols indicated almost the same dominant grain size (about 17<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm in paleosols and 18<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm in loess samples). However the GSD shapes in loess are different than those found in paleosols. In the paleosols, the shape of GSDs seems to be independent of climate and degree of pedogenesis. These factors control only the concentration of SP particles present in each paleosol. Temperature dependent M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy also supports the presence of SP particles both in loess and paleosol with a mean diameter around 13\u201314<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm. Dispersion of the diameters in the case of M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy varies from sample to sample being probably affected by random surface defects.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A broad range of paleoclimate proxy methods have been applied in the Maya Lowlands and the data derived from these methods are sometimes challenging for archaeologists and other non-specialists to interpret. This paper reviews the principal methods used for paleoclimate inference in the region and the rationale for climate proxy interpretation to help researchers working in the Maya Lowlands make sense of paleoclimate datasets. In particular, we focus on analyses of speleothems and lake sediment cores. These two paleoclimate archives have been most widely applied in the Maya Lowlands and have the greatest potential to provide insights into climate change impacts on the ancient Maya. We discuss the development of chronologies for these climate archives, the proxies for past climate change found within them, and how these proxy variables are interpreted. Finally, we present strategies for improving our understanding of proxy paleoclimate data from the Maya Lowlands, including multi-proxy analyses, assessment of spatial variability in past climate change, combined analysis of climate models and proxy data, and the integration of paleoclimatology and archaeology.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The sea surface temperature (SST) gradient between the Atlantic and Mediterranean sides of the Strait of Gibraltar can shed light on the communication between the two basins. IODP Site U1387 in the Gulf of Cadiz provides the first alkenone based reconstruction of SST for the Atlantic waters that flowed into the Mediterranean Sea during the Pliocene. This site reflects open ocean North Atlantic subtropical temperature trends while the published SST records from the Rossello composite section (Sicily) in the Mediterranean reflect the addition of regional, continentally-influenced signals from Europe and Northern Africa. The Mediterranean, in particular, may be influenced by high latitude Northern hemisphere climatic evolution. In the modern regime the sites discussed in this work have comparable SST and uninhibited surface connection; however, change in local heat loss/gain over the Mediterranean due to variability in latent heat loss and obstructed connection can result in a gradient between the sites in the Pliocene. The Pliocene surface waters of the Gulf of Cadiz and the Mediterranean Sea were as much as 7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C warmer than the modern average of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>19\u201320<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C.

The sequence was dated by radiocarbon and tephrochronology and used for multi-proxy analyses (chironomids, pollen, diatoms). Although the evolution of Beringian climate through the Holocene is primarily driven by global forcing mechanisms, regional controls, such as volcanic activity or vegetation dynamics, lead to a spatial heterogeneous response. This study aims to reconstruct past changes in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and to separate the climate-driven response from a response to regional or localised environmental change. Radiocarbon dates from plant macrophytes gave a basal date of 7800<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP. Coring terminated in a tephra layer, so sedimentation at the lake started prior to this date, possibly in the early Holocene following local glacier retreat. Initially the catchment vegetation was dominated by <italic>Betula</italic> and <italic>Alnus</italic> woodland with a mosaic of open, wet, aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Between 7800 and 6000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP the diatom-inferred lake water was pH<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>4.4\u20135.3 and chironomid and diatom assemblages in the lake were initially dominated by a small number of acidophilic/acid tolerant taxa. The frequency of <italic>Pinus pumila</italic> (Siberian dwarf pine) pollen increased from 5000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP and threshold analysis indicates that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pumila</italic> arrived in the catchment between 4200 and 3000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP. Its range expansion was probably mediated by strengthening of the Aleutian Low pressure system and increased winter snowfall. The diatom-inferred pH reconstructions show that after an initial period of low pH, pH gradually increased from 5500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP to pH<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>5.8 at 1500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP. This trend of increasing pH through the Holocene is unusual in lake records, but the initially low pH may have resulted directly or indirectly from intense regional volcanic activity during the mid-Holocene. The chironomid-inferred July temperature reconstruction suggests cool periods between 3200\u20132800<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP and 1100\u2013700<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP and a warmer period between 2800 and 1100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP. Chironomid and diatom DCA scores decline from ca. 6000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP, indicating compositional changes in these aquatic assemblages. In comparison declines in pollen PCA scores are delayed, starting ca. 5100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cal<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yr BP. The results suggest that while catchment vegetation was responding primarily to climate change, the biota within the lake and lake water chemistry were responding to localised environmental conditions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The major findings are as follows: (1) The soil temperature precipitation (ST P) coupling is quite weak and spatially scattered from both RegCM4 output and GLDAS data in each season with the only obvious signals existing over the north India region in summer season according to the RegCM4 output; the soil temperature 2m air temperature (ST T2m) coupling is strong and spatially continuous with the India (in spring, summer and autumn seasons), South Indochina (in spring and summer seasons) and part of North China (in summer season) standing out as hotspots. (2) The soil temperature evapotranspiration (ST ET) and soil temperature evaporative fraction (ST EF) coupling almost resembles the same spatial patterns and magnitude in each season. Both the ET and EF play an important role in linking ST P coupling in each season, but not in the ST T2m coupling. The hotspots of ST T2m coupling outweigh the areas with strong ST ET and ST EF coupling. Only the India and Indochina in each season are recognized by the RegCM4 while the Indochina and west Asia in spring, north India, Indochina and part of mid-high latitudes in summer season pinpointed by GLDAS data show consistent strong ST T2m coupling with significant ST ET and ST EF coupling. This finding demonstrates the complicated ST Atm coupling. (3) The ST anomalies prescribed at the first step of each season can only persist a short time (within 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days) over most part of the study area while the fixed one-month anomalies can last longer (approximately 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>months with colder anomalies and 45<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days with warmer anomalies in tropical regions). (4) The impact of ST anomalies on subsequent precipitation is quite weak and can be ignored over most part of the study area, while the impact on subsequent T2m is obvious and spatially continuous. The spatial patterns for the changes of climate variables (e.g., latent heat flux (LH), sensible heat flux (SH), ET, T2m) are almost consistent with the changes of ST over most part of the study area (except India and Indochina in spring and autumn seasons) where warmer (colder) ST anomalies lead to increase (decrease) of LH, SH, ET and T2m, demonstrating the important role of land atmosphere interactions in the locale climate. Over the India and Indochina, the large-scale circulation dominates the local climate in spring and autumn seasons. (5) The impact of colder ST anomalies can last longer than the warmer ones. Among the spring, summer and autumn seasons, the impact persists shortest in summer and longest in autumn, especially over the India region.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Quantifying this impact is difficult, since it requires knowing both the actual sediment yield (SY<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf>, [t<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2</sup> y<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>]) as well as the corresponding \u201cpristine\u201d value of a catchment (SY<inf loc=\"post\">p</inf>, [t<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2</sup> y<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>]; i.e. the sediment yield that can be expected if the catchment was not affected by humans). Here we address this problem by comparing measured SY<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf> values for 165 European catchments that were unaffected by dams or reservoirs with their corresponding SY<inf loc=\"post\">p</inf>, which were predicted using a recently developed regression model. The ratio between these two values is expected to reflect the degree of human impact on catchment sediment yield (HIF).</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Correlation and partial correlation analyses showed that spatial variability in HIF is mainly explained by differences in land use (i.e. the fraction of arable land) and catchment area. The effect of these two factors was clearly linked in western and central Europe: whereas SY<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf> can be easily 40 times higher than SY<inf loc=\"post\">p</inf> in intensively cultivated small (\u2264<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>) catchments, the difference is negligible for large (&amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>) catchments with the same land use. While, this concurs with our knowledge that the effects of land use (change) on erosion rates can be buffered at the catchment scale, this study provides a first robust quantification of this effect.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">Apart from a potential climatic effect (i.e. a correlation between HIF and the average annual air temperature) no other factors could be identified that are significant in explaining observed differences in HIF. This indicates that HIF is mainly controlled by catchment scale and land use, while other factors may be only of secondary importance at an intra-continental scale. Nonetheless, more accurate quantifications of these HIF values and more refined characterizations of the catchments in terms of (historical) land use, soil types/lithology, weather conditions and topography may reveal additional trends.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The results show that magnetic enhancement of early- to mid-Pleistocene loess\u2013paleosol sequences at both sites is not solely due to the neoformation of ultrafine magnetic particles through pedogenesis, but in the case of several loess layers (e.g., L8 and L9) is more attributed to the significant input of coarse-grained magnetic minerals associated with the advance of desert margin and/or with significant changes in local sediment input. Since the magnetoclimatological signals studied here are obviously controlled by both pedogenesis and wind vigor, measurements of magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), both of which are responsive to both ultrafine pedogenic magnetic particles and eolian coarse-grained pseudo-single domain/multi-domain magnetic particles, could not provide unambiguous interpretation of the magnetic response to the East Asian summer monsoon intensity. In contrast, anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and the percentage of frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7<inf loc=\"post\">fd</inf>%), which are notably responsive to ultrafine magnetic particles, can aptly trace changes in the concentration of pedogenic magnetic particles and can therefore be used as reliable proxies of pedogenic intensity. The magnetic grain size dependent proxies, e.g., ARM/\u03c7 and ARM/M<inf loc=\"post\">s</inf> (M<inf loc=\"post\">s</inf>, saturation magnetization), geochemical indices (e.g., chemical index of alteration, Zr/Rb and Al/Si ratios), and bulk grain size records all exhibit concordant variations and are more straightforward proxies for addressing the East Asian monsoon variability. Therefore the combination of multi-parameter mineral magnetic, geochemical and grain size analyses is very useful for distinguishing, delimiting and correlating loess sequences, and for accurately deciphering their paleoclimatic signals embedded in the weakly weathered loess. As the classical precipitation-driven pedogenic model for magnetic susceptibility enhancement is not entirely applicable to the early- to mid-Pleistocene loess developed in the semi-arid western CLP, considerable caution should also be warranted in using magnetic susceptibility measurements alone in the quantitative reconstruction of paleoprecipitation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
