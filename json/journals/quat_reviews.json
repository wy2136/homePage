Two of the lakes are located in the maritime, coastal region near Sisimiut and two inland close to the head of Kangerlussuaq fjord, where there is a more continental climate. Diatom records from the four lakes (AT1, AT4, SS1381, SS8) had similar long-term ontogeny trends, independent of climatic setting and the changes are interpreted as responses to first order weathering controls on catchment/lake chemistry. Short-term excursions from these broad trends occurred in one coastal site (AT4) caused by intense erosion of the steep catchment, and at inland sites where temporary hydrological closure and lake level decline occurred during the mid-Holocene (\u223c8000 \u2013 5000\u00a0cal a BP). Algal production (as <italic>\u03b2</italic> carotene) was more closely and consistently correlated with climatic changes; it peaked during the mid-Holocene, the warmest period of the Holocene, at all sites and there were transient increases in production in inland lakes during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age because of fertilization through increased aeolian dust deposition. A synthesis of seven palaeolimnological records from this region identified that only the mid-Holocene was correlated with diatom stratigraphic zones and there was considerable among-site variability in later Holocene lake response to climate forcing in this area. Comparable long-term trends in species assemblage turnover (DCA/CA axis 1 scores) clearly demonstrate that lakes have predictable ontogeny trends in this region, characterised by maximum alkalinity and nutrient availability in the first few millennia followed by progressive oligotrophication and alkalinity loss. However, individual lake and catchment characteristics (lake morphology, catchment geomorphology), when modified by climatic change (vegetation cover, erosion, weathering rates, aeolian dust deposition, lake level) can diverge from this ontogeny template leading to complex ecological transitions in lakes from this region.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, this notion has been challenged on the basis that the instrumental record is too short and unreliable to reveal long-term trends in hurricane activity. This study addresses this limitation by investigating hurricane-induced overwash deposits (paleotempestites) behind a barrier island in Naples, FL, USA. Paleotempestologic proxies including grain size, percent calcium carbonate, and fossil shells species were used to distinguish overwash events in two sediment cores spanning the last one thousand years. Two prominent paleotempestites were observed in the top 20\u00a0cm of both cores: the first identified as Hurricane Donna in 1960 whereas an older paleotempestite (1900\u20131930) could represent one of three documented storms in the early 1900s. An active period of hurricane overwash from 1000 to 500\u00a0yrs. BP and an inactive period from 500 to 150\u00a0yrs. BP correlate with reconstructed SSTs from the Main Development Region (MDR) of the North Atlantic Ocean. We observe an increased number of paleotempestites when MDR SSTs are warmer, coinciding with the Medieval Warm Period, and very few paleotempestites when MDR SSTs are cooler, coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Results from this initial Southwest Florida study indicate that MDR SSTs have been a key long-term climate driver of intense Southwest Florida hurricane strikes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Many modern and fossil wood specimens display rings sufficiently thick for intra-annual sampling, and analytical techniques are rapidly improving to allow for precise carbon and oxygen isotope measurements on very small samples, yielding unprecedented resolution of seasonal isotope records. However, the interpretation of these records across diverse environments has been problematic because a unifying model for the quantitative interpretation of seasonal climate parameters from oxygen isotopes in wood is lacking. Towards such a model, we compiled a dataset of intra-ring oxygen isotope measurements on modern wood cellulose (\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">cell</inf>) from 33 globally distributed sites. Five of these sites represent original data produced for this study, while the data for the other 28 sites were taken from the literature. We defined the intra-annual change in oxygen isotope value of wood cellulose [\u0394(\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">cell</inf>)] as the difference between the maximum and minimum \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">cell</inf> values determined within the ring. Then, using the monthly-resolved dataset of the oxygen isotope composition of meteoric water (\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">MW</inf>) provided by the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation database, we quantified the empirical relationship between the intra-annual change in meteoric water [\u0394(\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">MW</inf>)] and \u0394(\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">cell</inf>). We then used monthly-resolved datasets of temperature and precipitation to develop a global relationship between \u0394(\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">MW</inf>) and maximum/minimum monthly temperatures and winter/summer precipitation amounts. By combining these relationships we produced a single equation that explains much of the variability in the intra-ring \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">cell</inf> signal through only changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation amount (<italic>R</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.82). We show how our recent model that quantifies seasonal precipitation from intra-ring carbon isotope profiles can be incorporated into the oxygen model above in order to separately quantify both seasonal temperature and seasonal precipitation. Determination of seasonal climate variation using high-resolution isotopes in tree-ring records makes possible a new understanding of the seasonal fluctuations that control the environmental conditions to which organisms are subject, both during recent history and in the geologic past.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The significance of palaeo-ice sheets is further underlined by the broad range of disciplines concerned with reconstructing their behaviour, many of which have undergone a rapid expansion since the 1980s. In particular, there has been a major increase in the size and qualitative diversity of empirical data used to reconstruct and date ice sheets, and major improvements in our ability to simulate their dynamics in numerical ice sheet models. These developments have made it increasingly necessary to forge interdisciplinary links between sub-disciplines and to link numerical modelling with observations and dating of proxy records. The aim of this paper is to evaluate recent developments in the methods used to reconstruct ice sheets and outline some key challenges that remain, with an emphasis on how future work might integrate terrestrial and marine evidence together with numerical modelling. Our focus is on pan-ice sheet reconstructions of the last deglaciation, but regional case studies are used to illustrate methodological achievements, challenges and opportunities. Whilst various disciplines have made important progress in our understanding of ice-sheet dynamics, it is clear that data-model integration remains under-used, and that uncertainties remain poorly quantified in both empirically-based and numerical ice-sheet reconstructions. The representation of past climate will continue to be the largest source of uncertainty for numerical modelling. As such, palaeo-observations are critical to constrain and validate modelling. State-of-the-art numerical models will continue to improve both in model resolution and in the breadth of inclusion of relevant processes, thereby enabling more accurate and more direct comparison with the increasing range of palaeo-observations. Thus, the capability is developing to use all relevant palaeo-records to more strongly constrain deglacial (and to a lesser extent pre-LGM) ice sheet evolution. In working towards that goal, the accurate representation of uncertainties is required for both constraint data and model outputs. Close cooperation between modelling and data-gathering communities is essential to ensure this capability is realised and continues to progress.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S027737911530055X-fx1.jpg\" height=\"184\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

Pollen analysis from two marine sediment cores (NGHP-01-16A and NGHP-01-19B) collected from the offshore Godavari and Mahanadi basins, both located in the Core Monsoon Zone (CMZ) reveals changes in Indian summer monsoon variability and intensity during three contrasting climatic periods: the Holocene, the Heinrich Stadial (HS) 2 and the Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5/4 during the ice sheet growth transition. During the first part of the Holocene between 11,300 and 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP, characterized by high insolation (minimum precession, maximum obliquity), the maximum extension of the coastal forest and mangrove reflects high monsoon rainfall. This climatic regime contrasts with that of the second phase of the Holocene, from 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP to the present, marked by the development of drier vegetation in a context of low insolation (maximum precession, minimum obliquity). The historical period in India is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak monsoon centennial phases that may reflect the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. During the HS 2, a period of low insolation and extensive iceberg discharge in the North Atlantic Ocean, vegetation was dominated by grassland and dry flora indicating pronounced aridity as the result of a weak Indian summer monsoon. The MIS 5/4 glaciation, also associated with low insolation but moderate freshwater fluxes, was characterized by a weaker reduction of the Indian summer monsoon and a decrease of seasonal contrast as recorded by the expansion of dry vegetation and the development of <italic>Artemisia</italic>, respectively. Our results support model predictions suggesting that insolation changes control the long term trend of the Indian monsoon precipitation, but its millennial scale variability and intensity are instead modulated by atmospheric teleconnections to remote phenomena in the North Atlantic, Eurasia or the Indian Ocean.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This low carbonate% event occurred at a time when the regional sea level rose from\u00a0\u221250\u00a0m to\u00a0\u221210\u00a0m, which drowned large areas of continental shelves especially those near and within the Taiwan Strait. This event is associated with a significant increase in bulk sedimentation rates on the upper continental slope and the relative abundance of fine-grained detritus. Sediment provenance analyses suggest a dominant terrigenous input from Taiwan and a minor contribution from Luzon during the low carbonate% event, similar to the background terrigenous deposition in other periods of the Holocene. Two comparable low carbonate% events, respectively from the beginning of marine isotope stages 5.5 and 7.3, have also been recognized, pointing to similar causal factors. While carbonate dissolution and carbonate accumulation rate should not have been responsible, increased terrigenous input and dilution is considered as the main cause for the recurrent low carbonate% events in early interglacials. We further hypothesize that, during early interglacials, fluvial sediment discharge from Taiwan and Luzon intensified due to stronger typhoon activities, and massive fine-grained sediments from these two end members may have been transported to the northern SCS continental slope via surface and deep ocean currents.

We here studied diatom assemblages, nitrogen isotopes, and major and minor elements at the lamination level in three laminated trigger cores located between 11\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S on the Peruvian shelf within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) to reconstruct precipitation and ocean productivity at the multiannual to multidecadal timescales over the last millennium. We respected the sediment structure, thus providing the first records of the mean climatic conditions at the origin of the lamination deposition, which ones represent several years. Light laminations were deposited under productive and dry conditions, indicative of La Ni\u00f1a-like mean conditions in the system, while dark laminations were deposited under non-productive and humid conditions, representative of El Ni\u00f1o-like mean conditions.

Here we discuss the sensitivity of mid-Holocene Arctic climate to changes in albedo brought by a rapid desertification of the Sahara. By comparing a network of surface temperature reconstructions with output from a coupled global climate model, we find that, through a system of land-atmosphere feedbacks, the end of the AHP reduced the atmospheric and oceanic poleward heat transport from tropical to high northern latitudes. This entails a general weakening of the mid-latitude Westerlies, which results in a shift towards cooling over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions, and a change from positive to negative Arctic Oscillation-like conditions. This mechanism would explain the sign of rapid hydro-climatic perturbations recorded in several reconstructions from high northern latitudes at 5.5\u20135.0\u00a0kyr\u00a0BP, suggesting that these regions are sensitive to changes in Saharan land cover during the present interglacial.

In many regions, a paucity of reliably dated fossil occurrences of megafauna makes it challenging, if not impossible, to test many of the leading extinction hypotheses. The giant monitor lizards of Australia are a case in point. Despite commonly being argued to have suffered extinction at the hands of the first human colonisers (who arrived by 50\u00a0ka), it has never been reliably demonstrated that giant monitors and humans temporally overlapped in Australia. Here we present the results of an integrated U\u2013Th and <sup loc=\"pre\">14</sup>C dating study of a late Pleistocene fossil deposit that has yielded the youngest dated remains of giant monitor lizards in Australia. The site, Colosseum Chamber, is a cave deposit in the Mt Etna region, central eastern Australia. Sixteen new dates were generated and demonstrate that the bulk of the material in the deposit accumulated since ca. 50\u00a0ka. The new monitor fossil is, minimally, 30\u00a0ky younger than the previous youngest reliably dated record for giant lizards in Australia and for the first time, demonstrates that on a continental scale, humans and giant lizards overlapped in time. The new record brings the existing geochronological dataset for Australian giant monitor lizards to seven dated occurrences. With such sparse data, we are hesitant to argue that our new date represents the time of their extinction from the continent. Rather, we suspect that future fossil collecting will yield new samples both older and younger than 50\u00a0ka. Nevertheless, we unequivocally demonstrate that humans and giant monitor lizards overlapped temporally in Australia, and thus, humans can only now be considered potential drivers for their extinction.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Paleotemperature reconstructions at low-latitude glaciers are uniquely fruitful because they can provide both site-specific information and enhanced understanding of regional-scale variations due to the structure of the tropical atmosphere. We produce Little Ice Age (LIA) and Younger Dryas (YD) paleoclimate reconstructions for the Huancan\u00e9 outlet glacier of the Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC) and low-latitude southern hemisphere regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs) using a coupled ice-flow and energy balance model. We also model the effects of long-term changes in the summit temperature and precipitiation rate and the effects of interannual climate variability on the Huancan\u00e9 glacier length. We find temperature to be the dominant climate driver of glacier length change. Also, we find that interannual climate variability cannot adequately explain glacier advances inferred from the geomorphic record, necessitating that these features were formed during past colder climates. To constrain our LIA reconstruction, we incorporate the QIC ice core record, finding a LIA air temperature cooling at the ice cap of between \u223c0.7\u00a0\u00b0C and \u223c1.1\u00a0\u00b0C and \u223c0.4\u00a0\u00b0C and regional SSTs cooling of \u223c0.6\u00a0\u00b0C. For the YD paleoclimate reconstructions, we propose two limits on the precipitation rate, since the ice core record does not extend into the Pleistocene: 1) the precipitation rate scales with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (upper limit on cooling) and 2) the precipitation rate increases by 40% (lower limit on cooling), which is an increase about twice as great as the regional increases realized in GCM simulations for the period. The first limit requires \u223c1.6\u00a0\u00b0C cooling in ice cap air temperatures and \u223c0.9\u00a0\u00b0C cooling in SSTs, and the second limit requires \u223c1.0\u00a0\u00b0C cooling in ice cap air temperatures and \u223c0.5\u00a0\u00b0C cooling in SSTs.

To more effectively interpret and synthesize key regional records, we reanalysed the data from 13 pollen sequences from the summer rainfall zone of South Africa spanning the last 45,000 years, obtaining directly comparable quantitative reconstructions of mean annual temperature and summer rainfall. Temperature reconstructions from across the region provide consistent results, with all sites reflecting trends observed in southwest Indian Ocean sea-surface temperatures in the adjacent Mozambique Channel. Precipitation reconstructions are more heterogeneous, with two distinct subregions being identified. In the northeast, long-term trends in precipitation are determined by sea-surface and continental temperature trends, revealing a positive relationship between temperature and rainfall. This long-term pattern appears to be primarily driven by high northern latitude mechanisms, with direct local insolation being subordinate. Their relative impact reversed during terminal glacial period/early Holocene, at which time direct insolation forcing became the main driver of rainfall variability. Further south, in central South Africa, precipitation variability appears also to be influenced by the latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, which combine with tropical flow to create tropical-temperate trough, advecting moisture into the interior. In this region, periods of maximum precipitation coincide with periods of elevated SSTs and equatorward expansions of the westerly storm track. This study allows for a fully constrained understanding of climate dynamics along the eastern African margin for the last 45,000 years, linking dynamics to drivers and describing how the climate systems evolved across the last glacial\u2013interglacial transition.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Most lakes in the upper Midwestern U.S. were formed by glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age approximately 11,700\u00a0cal\u00a0yr\u00a0BP. Devils Lake, Wisconsin is a rare example of a lake from this region whose sediments extend into the Pleistocene and may include the Last Glacial Maximum. Sediment magnetic, geochemical, pollen, and charcoal records were generated from a 10\u00a0m core whose basal sediments may be 28,000 years old. Together with a previously published pollen record, these proxies combine to reveal a history of long-term climatic, vegetative and geologic change during the late Pleistocene to Holocene. We identify six sedimentary units that indicate a series of consecutive events rather than a predictable trajectory of ecosystem development at the site. Productivity in the lake was low during the late Pleistocene and increased during the Holocene, as reflected by the sediment lithology, which shows a sudden shift from glacial vivianite-rich and organic-poor clastic-dominated sediments to Holocene diatomaceous sapropels. Several important processes initiated around 17,000\u00a0cal\u00a0yr\u00a0BP, including the onset of organic matter accumulation and fire in the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the post-glacial landscape was not devoid of vegetation because pollen assemblages indicate that terrestrial vegetation, likely a spruce tundra, survived near the site. A switch to a hardwood forest period during the Holocene also led to a change in the fire regime, with increased frequency of burning. Aquatic ecosystem productivity lagged terrestrial ecosystem productivity throughout the record. Nutrient cycling (as recorded by sedimentary \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">15</sup>N) was variable but not directional, and appeared to be correlated with climate conditions early in the record, and terrestrial ecosystem processes later in the record. Throughout the Holocene magnetic mineral concentration decreased as productivity increased, and the source of magnetic material shifted from almost exclusively lithogenic to approximately 50% derived from soil or biogenic sources. Magnetic grain size, <italic>Ambrosia</italic> pollen percentages, and charcoal concentration increased and \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">15</sup>N decreased in the most recent part of the record, due to anthropogenic influence in the region including agricultural activities.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We synthesized the evidence for Maya impacts on climate, vegetation, hydrology and the lithosphere, from studies of soils, lakes, floodplains, wetlands and other ecosystems. Maya civilization had likely altered local to regional ecosystems and hydrology by the Preclassic Period (3000-1700\u00a0BP), but these impacts waned by 1000\u00a0BP. They altered ecosystems with vast urban and rural infrastructure that included thousands of reservoirs, wetland fields and canals, terraces, field ridges, and temples. Although there is abundant evidence that indicates the Maya altered their forests, even at the large urban complex of Tikal as much as 40% of the forest remained intact through the Classic period. Existing forests are still influenced by ancient Maya forest gardening, particularly by the large expanses of ancient stone structures, terraces, and wetland fields that form their substrates. A few studies suggest deforestation and other land uses probably also warmed and dried regional climate by the Classic Period (1700-1100\u00a0BP). A much larger body of research documents the Maya impacts on hydrology, in the form of dams, reservoirs, canals, eroded soils and urban design for runoff. Another metric of the \u201cMayacene\u201d are paleosols, which contain chemical evidence for human occupation, revealed by high phosphorus concentrations and carbon isotope ratios of C<inf loc=\"post\">4</inf> species like maize in the C<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf>\u2013dominated tropical forest ecosystem. Paleosol sequences exhibit \u201cMaya Clays,\u201d a facies that reflects a glut of rapidly eroded sediments that overlie pre-Maya paleosols. This stratigraphy is conspicuous in many dated soil profiles and marks the large-scale Maya transformation of the landscape in the Preclassic and Classic periods. Some of these also have increased phosphorous and carbon isotope evidence of C<inf loc=\"post\">4</inf> species. We synthesize and provide new evidence of Maya-period soil strata that show elevated carbon isotope ratios (\u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">13</sup>C), indicating the presence of C<inf loc=\"post\">4</inf> species in typical agricultural sites.

(1) El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation variability, while the most important global-scale mode of interannual climate variation, is insufficient to explain most of the variation of tropical South American climate observed in both the instrumental and the paleoclimate records. (2) Significant climate variation in tropical South America occurs on seasonal to orbital (i.e. multi-millennial) time scales as a result of sea-surface temperature (SST) variation and ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions of the tropical Atlantic. (3) Decadal-scale climate variability, linked with this tropical Atlantic variability, has been a persistent characteristic of climate in tropical South America for at least the past half millennium, and likely, far beyond. (4) Centennial-to-millennial climate events in tropical South America were of longer duration and, perhaps, larger amplitude than any observed in the instrumental period, which is little more than a century long in tropical South America. These were superimposed upon both precession-paced insolation changes that caused significant variation in SASM precipitation and eccentricity-paced global glacial boundary conditions that caused significant changes in the tropical South American moisture balance. As a result, river sediment and water discharge increased and decreased across tropical South America, lake levels rose and fell, paleolakes arose and disappeared on the Altiplano, glaciers waxed and waned in the tropical Andes, and the tropical rainforest underwent significant changes in composition and extent.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">To further evaluate climate forcing over the last glacial cycle (\u223c125\u00a0ka), we developed a climate forcing model that combines summer insolation forcing and a proxy for North Atlantic SST forcing to reconstruct long-term precipitation variation in the SASM domain. The success of this model reinforces our confidence in assigning causation to observed reconstructions of precipitation. In addition, we propose a critical correction for speleothem stable oxygen isotopic ratios, which are among the most significant of paleoclimate proxies in tropical South America for reconstruction of variation of paleo-precipitation (or SASM intensity). However, it is already well known that any particular \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O value observed in speleothem carbonate is affected by two processes that have nothing to do with changes in precipitation amount\u2014the influence of temperature on carbonate-water isotopic fractionation in the cave and the influence of changing \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O of seawater. Quantitatively accounting for both \u201cartifacts\u201d can significantly alter the interpretations of speleothem records. In tropical South America, both adjustments act in the same direction and have the tendency to increase the true amplitude of the paleo-hydrologic signal (but by different amounts in glacial and inter-glacial stages). These corrections have even graver implications for the interpretation of tropical Northern Hemisphere speleothem records (e.g. Chinese speleothems) where the combined adjustments tend to decrease or even eliminate the \u201ctrue\u201d signal amplitude.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study we use climate-model simulations covering the last glacial cycle (120<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kyr) with HadCM3 and the multi-model ensembles from PMIP3 (the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project) to investigate the long-term behaviour of the African rainbelt, and test these simulations against existing empirical palaeohydrological records. Through regional model-data comparisons we find evidence for the validity of several hypotheses, with various proposed processes occurring concurrently but with different regional emphasis (e.g. asymmetric shifts at the seasonal extremes and symmetric expansions/contractions towards West equatorial regions). Crucially, variations in rainfall are associated with multiple forcing mechanisms that vary in their dominance both spatially and temporally over the glacial cycle; an important consideration when interpreting and extrapolating from often relatively short palaeoenvironmental records.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The human remains were dated to between 12 and 13 Ka, making these remains the oldest securely dated in the Yucatan. Twelve sediment cores were used to reconstruct the Holocene flooding history of the now phreatic cave passages and cenotes (Ich Balam, Oasis) that connect to HN. Four facies were found: 1. bat guano and Seed (SF), 2. lime Mud (MF), 3. Calcite Rafts (CRF) and 4. Organic Matter/Calcite Rafts (OM/CRF) which were defined by their lithologic characteristics and ostracod, foraminifera and testate amoebae content. Basal radiocarbon ages (AMS) of aquatic sediments (SF) combined with cave bottom and ceiling height profiles determined the history of flooding in HN and when access was restricted for human and animal entry. Our results show that the bottom of HN was flooded at least by 9850\u00a0cal yr BP but likely earlier. We also found, that the pit became inaccessible for human and animal entry at \u22488100\u00a0cal yr BP, when water reaching the cave ceiling effectively prevented entry. Water level continued to rise between \u22486000 and 8100\u00a0cal yr BP, filling the cave passages and entry points to HN (Cenotes Ich Balam and Oasis). Analysis of cave facies revealed that both Holocene sea-level rise and cave ceiling height determined the configuration of airways and the deposition of floating and bat derived OM (guano and seeds). Calcite rafts, which form on the water surface, are also dependent on the presence of airways but can also form in isolated air domes in the cave ceiling that affect their loci of deposition on the cave bottom. These results indicated that aquatic cave sedimentation is transient in time and space, necessitating extraction of multiple cores to determine a limit after which flooding occurred.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The chronological data obtained from sandsheet units testify to the development of transgressive dunefields since at least the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 10). Three main phases of accumulation occurred during the Last Glacial. The oldest one (64\u201342 ka) is associated with wet sandsheet facies, histic horizons and zibar-type dune fields, which reflect deposition in a context strongly influenced by the groundwater table. The Late Pleniglacial (24\u201314 ka) corresponds to the main phase of coversand extension in a drier context. Silty gley horizons suggest, however, local interruptions of sand drifting during GS 2.1. Lateglacial stabilization of the coversands may not have occurred before GI-1c (Aller\u00f8d), which was typified by the development of cumulic arenosols. These were covered by parabolic dunes during the Younger Dryas. The variations in extent of the emerged continental shelf during the glacial\u2013interglacial cycles may explain the uneven geographical distribution of sand deposition through time. Because of coastline retreat up to 100\u00a0km north of 45\u00b0N during the LGM lowstand, the coversands were unable to reach the northern part of the basin. Comparison with other European regions highlights stronger affinities of the French record with Portugal than with the Netherlands and Great Britain, probably because of reduced influence of permafrost.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Owing to the short distances traveled before deposition, the incomplete bleaching of luminescence signals in glacial sediments may introduce serious dating problems <italic>vis-\u00e0-vis</italic> glacial and any associated sediments. Here, we report a comparison of OSL ages obtained from the fine (4\u201311\u00a0\u03bcm) and medium (38\u201363\u00a0\u03bcm) grain size fractions of quartz extracted from glaciofluvial sediments and from glacial tills in the Basongcuo catchment near the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Initially, four glacial stages were identified based on field observations of moraine distribution and geomorpho-stratigraphic relations. A total of 39 OSL samples were then collected from glaciofluvial sand layers or lenses and from till. Quartz grains in the fine (4\u201311\u00a0\u03bcm) and medium (38\u201363\u00a0\u03bcm) size fractions were extracted from each sample, and dated using the single-aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocol. The modern supraglacial sediment sample was dated to \u223c0.2 (fine grain) to \u223c0.7 (medium grain) ka, suggesting that the sediment was not completely bleached on deposition. Contrary to previous experience suggesting that coarse grains are usually better bleached than fine grains prior to deposition, our results show that estimated OSL ages for fine grains are generally younger than those for medium grains. This suggests that the two fractions may have come from different sources and thus have different bleaching histories, and that fine-grained quartz may be more suitable for OSL dating of these materials. Applying the minimum age model to data from medium-grained quartz yields ages close to those obtained from fine-grained quartz, suggesting that both can be used for dating glacial advances. The OSL dates suggest that glaciers in the studied area advanced at 0.1\u20131.3\u00a0ka, \u223c7.5\u00a0ka and 11\u201313\u00a0ka, and were furthest advanced between \u223c16 and \u223c30\u00a0ka. The timing of the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is broadly consistent throughout the eastern and central Himalaya and frequent glacial advances after the LGM.

More knowledge of the speed of climate shifts and the degree to which they were synchronous with changes in the North Atlantic or elsewhere is required to understand better the controls on Eastern Mediterranean climate. Using endogenic carbonate from a sediment sequence from Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc, a maar lake in central Turkey, dated by varve counting and uranium-thorium methods, we present high-resolution (\u223c25 years) oxygen (<italic>\u03b4</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O) and carbon isotope records, supported by carbonate mineralogy data, spanning the late glacial and Holocene. <italic>\u03b4</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">carbonate</inf> at Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc has been shown previously to be a strong proxy for regional water balance. After a dry period (i.e. evaporation far exceeding precipitation) in the Younger Dryas, the data show a transition into the relatively wetter early Holocene. In the early Holocene there are two drier periods that appear to peak at \u223c9.3\u00a0ka and \u223c8.2\u00a0ka, coincident with cooling \u2018events\u2019 seen in North Atlantic records. After this, and as seen in other records from the Eastern Mediterranean, there is a millennial-scale drying trend through the Mid Holocene Transition.

When used in conjunction with proximal records of volcanic activity they can also provide information about volcanic ash cloud fallout and frequency. However, the spatial distributions of tephra layers can be discontinuous even within the same region. Understanding the deposition and post-depositional redistribution of tephra is vital if we are to use cryptotephras as records of ash cloud occurrence and chronostratigraphic markers. The discrete nature of tephra layers also allows for detailed study into processes of deposition and reworking which affect many palaeoenvironmental proxy records.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">We undertook a multi-core study in order to examine the historical tephrostratigraphy of a raised peatland in Northern Ireland. Three tephra layers originating from Iceland (Hekla 1947, Hekla 1845 and Hekla 1510) are present in 14 of the 15 cores analysed. This suggests that in areas not influenced by snowfall or anthropogenic disturbance at the time of tephra delivery, the presence or absence of a tephra layer is generally consistent across a peatland of this type. However, tephra shard counts (per unit area) vary by an order of magnitude between cores. These intra-site differences may confound the interpretation of shard counts from single cores as records of regional ash cloud mass/density. Bootstrap resampling analysis suggests that total shard counts from multiple cores are required in order to make a reliable estimate of median shard counts for a site. The presence of three historical tephras in 14 cores enables a spatio-temporal analysis of the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LARCA) in the peatland. Substantial spatial and temporal variations in LARCA are identified over the last \u223c450 years.

Chironomid assemblages from the uppermost sediments of 366 lakes spanning northern North America were compared to environmental parameters using direct gradient analysis. While temperature expectedly explained the largest amount of variation in the chironomid assemblages, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) accounted for significant amounts of the remaining variance. By constraining chironomid assemblages to mean-July air temperature (JulyT), we found a cluster of 70 lakes that were orthogonal to the primary temperature gradient in ordination. These lakes tended to be cold with higher DOC and TKN concentrations, yet had chironomid assemblages that were similar to the assemblages found in less productive, warmer lakes. In order to examine how secondary gradients affected paleotemperature reconstructions, three chironomid-based transfer function models were generated: a full dataset model (all 366 lakes), a reduced temperature-constrained model (296 lakes), and a reduced secondary-constrained model (70 lakes). Application of these models to four previously published Holocene paleotemperature reconstructions were used to distinguish the influence of temperature versus secondary-gradient effects. While unproductive Arctic lake paleotemperature reconstructions were found to be robust, reconstructions for two lakes in the boreal-tundra ecotone suggest secondary gradients influenced parts of their records. We recommend that passive core trajectory analysis upon our expansive surface-sediment calibration set provides a means to assess the veracity of paleotemperature reconstructions and potential influence of secondary gradients.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The robust chronology of the presented record is based on varve counting and AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant macro-remains. In addition to the qualitative interpretation of the pollen data, we provide quantitative reconstructions of vegetation and climate based on the method of biomization and weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) technique, respectively. Power spectra were computed to investigate the frequency domain distribution of proxy signals and potential natural periodicities. Pollen assemblages, pollen-derived biome scores and climate variables as well as the cyclicity pattern indicate that NE China experienced significant changes in temperature and moisture conditions during the Holocene. Within the earliest phase of the Holocene, a large-scale reorganization of vegetation occurred, reflecting the reconstructed shift towards higher temperatures and precipitation values and the initial Holocene strengthening and northward expansion of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Afterwards, summer temperatures remain at a high level, whereas the reconstructed precipitation shows an increasing trend until approximately 4000\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP. Since 3500\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP, temperature and precipitation values decline, indicating moderate cooling and weakening of the EASM. A distinct periodicity of 550\u2013600 years and evidence of a Mid\u2013Holocene transition from a temperature-triggered to a predominantly moisture-triggered climate regime are derived from the power spectra analysis. The results obtained from SHL are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records from NE China, substantiating the regional nature of the reconstructed vegetation and climate patterns. However, the reconstructed climate changes contrast with the moisture evolution recorded in S China and the mid-latitude (semi-)arid regions of N China. Whereas a clear insolation-related trend of monsoon intensity over the Holocene is lacking from the SHL record, variations in the coupled atmosphere-Pacific Ocean system can largely explain the reconstructed changes in NE China.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The lobe was situated in an area with varied topography in the foreland of a mountain range. The ice lobe had a complex form because it was subdivided into several smaller sublobes. The primary factors that controlled the lobe were investigated. It was found that the ice-lobe development depended largely on the topography, but the lithology of the ice sheet substratum was also highly important. The topography controlled the main movement direction of the ice and caused a concentration of the ice flow in the axial part of the Silesian Lowland between subglacial morphological barriers, which thereby formed a corridor of relatively fast flowing ice, which was probably streaming and which supplied the lobe. The topography also determined the ice flow within the lobe, which strongly matched the valley system. The presence of sediments with relatively low permeability at the base of the lobe (the Quaternary deposits are underlain by Neogene clays) caused high pore-water pressure in the subglacial zone and triggered the basal movement of the ice sheet, which promoted a rapid flow of the ice and favoured the development of the lobe. The basal tills deposited from the active and passive ice and extant till patches without a fluvioglacial cover atop some parts of the studied area indicate spatially varying ice flow dynamics, especially in the later stage of glaciation. Certain parts of the lobe underwent stagnation, while in other parts, the ice was probably still active. The varied behaviour of the ice within the lobe was determined primarily by the topography and lithology of the substratum, which produced spatially varied marginal compression and basal friction.

We investigate the separate precession and obliquity forcing of the freshwater budget over the Mediterranean using a high-resolution coupled climate model, EC-Earth. At times of enhanced insolation seasonality, i.e. minimum precession and maximum obliquity, the area was wetter and the Mediterranean Sea surface was less saline. The latter has been attributed to increased runoff from the south as a consequence of a strengthened North African monsoon, as well as to increased precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea itself. Our results show that both mechanisms play a role in changing the freshwater budget. Increased monsoon runoff occurs in summer during times of enhanced insolation seasonality, especially minimum precession, while increased precipitation is important in winter for both precession and obliquity. We relate changes in winter precipitation to changes in the air-sea temperature difference and subsequently, convective precipitation. The freshening in the minimum precession and maximum obliquity experiments has a strong effect on Mediterranean sea surface salinity and mixed layer depth, thereby likely influencing deep sea circulation and sedimentation at the ocean bottom.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study provides a synthesis of the stratigraphic architecture of Middle Pleistocene to Holocene fluvial terraces in the upper Weser and middle Leine valley in northern Germany and links it to glaciation, climate and base-level change.

During the Pleistocene up to 170\u00a0m of fluvial incision took place. A major change in terrace style from strath terraces to cut-and-fill terraces occurred during the early Middle Pleistocene before Marine Isotope Stage MIS 12, which may correlate with climate deterioration and the onset of glaciation in northern central Europe. During this time a stable buffer zone was established within which channels avulsed and cut and filled freely without leaving these vertical confines. Climate was the dominant driver for river incision and aggradation, whereas the terrace style was controlled by base-level changes during ice-sheet growth and decay.

The Late Pleistocene braided river systems (MIS 5c to MIS 3) are characterized by a high sinuosity, which may be a direct effect of an increased downstream gradient after deglaciation when the channel lengthened and the river adjusted to the increased gradient by increasing sinuosity.

Tephrostratigraphy is commonly used as a reconstructive tool by cross-correlating tephra deposits to create a stratigraphic framework that can be used to assess magnitude\u2013frequency relationships for eruptive histories. When applied to widespread rhyolitic deposits, tephra identifications and correlations have been successful; however, the identification and correlation of basaltic tephras are more problematic. Here, using tephras in drill cores from six maars in the Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF), New Zealand, we show how X-ray density scanning coupled with magnetic susceptibility analysis can be used to accurately and reliably identify basaltic glass shard-bearing horizons in lacustrine sediments and which, when combined with the major and trace element signatures of the tephras, can be used to distinguish primary from reworked layers. After reliably identifying primary vs. reworked basaltic horizons within the cores, we detail an improved method for cross-core correlation based on stratigraphy and geochemical fingerprinting. We present major and trace element data for individual glass shards from 57 separate basaltic horizons identified within the cores.

Frequently dominated by outcrops of structurally complex bedrock, the seabed also comprises numerous assemblages of well-preserved glacigenic landforms typical of grounded ice sheet flow and punctuated ice-margin retreat. The occurrence and character of the glacially streamlined landforms is controlled in part by the shallow geology and topography, however these factors alone cannot account for the location, orientation, and configuration of the observed landforms. We attribute the distribution of these elongate streamlined landforms to the onset zone of the former Hebrides Ice Stream (HIS) \u2013 part of a major ice stream system that drained 5\u201310% of the last British\u2013Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS). We suggest this geomorphic signature represents the transition from slow \u2018sheet flow\u2019 to \u2018streaming flow\u2019 as ice accelerated out from an environment characterized by numerous bedrock obstacles (e.g. islands, headlands), towards the smooth, sediment dominated shelf. The majority of streamlined landforms associated with the HIS indicate ice sheet flow to the southwest, with regional-scale topography clearly playing a major role in governing the configuration of flow. During maximal glacial conditions (\u223c29\u201323\u00a0ka) we infer that the HIS merged with the North Channel-Malin Shelf Ice Stream to form a composite ice stream system that ultimately reached the continental shelf edge at the Barra-Donegal Trough-Mouth Fan. Taken collectively however, the pattern of landforms now preserved at seabed (e.g. convergent flow indicators, cross-cutting flow sets) is more indicative of a thinning ice mass, undergoing reorganization during overall ice sheet retreat (during latter stages of Late Weischselian glaciation). Suites of moraines overprinting the streamlined landforms suggest partial stabilization of the HIS prior to the ice sheet retreating to more isolated, topographically confined troughs and basins. Retreat from the shelf towards, and back into the Inner Hebrides may have been rapid due the prevalence of overdeepened troughs. Within the near-shore fjord-like troughs and deeps, basin-aligned streamlined landforms indicate the subsequent flow of thinner topographically partitioned ice masses, and overprinted moraines record further ice margin retreat, potentially along tide-water margins. This work provides the first geomorphological constraints for this large marine-influenced sector of the former BIIS. We also shed new light on the glacial geomorphic record found at the transition from terrestrial to marine continental-shelf settings, and examine the interplay between substrate geology, bed topography/bathymetry, and grounding-line positions \u2013 relationships which are important for characterizing contemporary marine ice sheet margins.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Correlations undertaken with improved palaeoclimatic data and archaeological records indicate that the regional time-series curves are robust, and can be used as a proxy for human behaviour. However, interrogation of the datasets is essential with artificial peaks and taphonomic over-correction being critical considerations. The time-series curves are interpreted as reflecting population growth, stasis and even decline in phase with terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene climatic fluctuations. This coupling, however, decreases during the last 5000 years, most likely due to increased population levels, greater territoriality, technological solutions to stress, and social and ideational innovation. Curves from all sectors show exponential population growth over the last 5000 years.

To date, research efforts have mainly focused on the North American (Laurentide) ice-sheets (LIS), leaving the potential role of the European Ice Sheet (EIS), and of the Scandinavian ice-sheet (SIS) in particular, largely unexplored. Using neodymium isotopes in detrital sediments deposited off the Channel River, we provide a continuous and well-dated record for the evolution of the EIS southern margin through the end of the last glacial period and during the deglaciation. Our results reveal that the evolution of EIS margins was accompanied with substantial ice recession (especially of the SIS) and simultaneous release of meltwater to the North Atlantic. These events occurred both in the course of the EIS to its LGM position (i.e., during Heinrich Stadial \u2013HS\u2013 3 and HS2; \u223c31\u201329\u00a0ka and \u223c26\u201323\u00a0ka, respectively) and during the deglaciation (i.e., at \u223c22\u00a0ka, \u223c20\u201319\u00a0ka and from 18.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 to 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 ka that corresponds to the first part of HS1). The deglaciation was discontinuous in character, and similar in timing to that of the southern LIS margin, with moderate ice-sheet retreat (from 22.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0ka in the Baltic lowlands) as soon as the northern summer insolation increase (from \u223c23\u00a0ka) and an acceleration of the margin retreat thereafter (from \u223c20\u00a0ka). Importantly, our results show that EIS retreat events and release of meltwater to the North Atlantic during the deglaciation coincide with AMOC destabilisation and interhemispheric climate changes. They thus suggest that the EIS, together with the LIS, could have played a critical role in the climatic reorganization that accompanied the last deglaciation. Finally, our data suggest that meltwater discharges to the North Atlantic produced by large-scale recession of continental parts of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during HS, could have been a possible source for the oceanic perturbations (i.e., AMOC shutdown) responsible for the marine-based ice stream purge cycle, or so-called HE's, that punctuate the last glacial period.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Changes in the vigour of the overflows may have had important climatic effects in the past and may also have in the future. Yet, evidence for multidecadal to millennial changes in the deep limb of the AMOC and their potential relationship to North Atlantic climate variability during the Holocene remains weakly constrained. Here we present grain size data, as a proxy for near-bottom current speed, from sub-decadal to decadally resolved sediment cores located in the direct pathway of the two Nordic Overflows east and west of Iceland, the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), respectively. The results show no clear relationship between reconstructed changes in the vigour of the Nordic Overflows and the well-known periods of centennial-scale climate variability recorded in the North Atlantic region. However, well-defined millennial-scale trends are found in both of the overflow strength records over the last 3000 years, which were possibly related to hydrographic reorganizations in the Nordic Seas, driven by the decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation over the Neoglacial period. A comparison between the near-bottom flow speed reconstructions from ISOW and DSOW suggests an anti-phased relationship between the Nordic Seas Overflows east and west of Iceland over the last 3000 years. This feature has been observed in climate models potentially as a result of shifts in the deep water formation sites as a response to changes in atmospheric patterns over the Nordic Seas.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Here, we reconstruct centennial-scale hydrological variability during the Holocene associated to changes in the intensity of the ISM based on a record of lipid biomarker abundances and compound-specific stable isotopic composition of a 10\u00a0m long sediment core from saline\u2013alkaline Lonar Lake, situated in the core \u2018monsoon zone\u2019 of central India.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">We identified three main periods of distinct hydrology during the Holocene in central India. The period between 10.1 and 6\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP was likely the wettest during the Holocene. Lower average chain length (ACL) index values (29.4\u201328.6) and negative \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values (\u221234.8\u2030 to\u00a0\u221227.8\u2030) of leaf wax <italic>n</italic>-alkanes indicate the dominance of woody C<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> vegetation in the catchment, and negative \u03b4D<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values (concentration weighted average) (\u2212171\u2030 to\u00a0\u2212147\u2030) suggest a wet period due to an intensified monsoon. After 6\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP, a gradual shift to less negative \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values (particularly for the grass derived <italic>n</italic>-C<inf loc=\"post\">31</inf>) and appearance of the triterpene lipid tetrahymanol, generally considered as a marker for salinity and water column stratification, mark the onset of drier conditions. At 5.1\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP an increasing flux of leaf wax <italic>n</italic>-alkanes along with the highest flux of tetrahymanol indicate a major lowering of the lake level. Between 4.8 and 4\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP, we find evidence for a transition to arid conditions, indicated by high and strongly variable tetrahymanol flux. In addition, a pronounced shift to less negative \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values, in particular for <italic>n</italic>-C<inf loc=\"post\">31</inf> (\u221225.2\u2030 to\u00a0\u221222.8\u2030), during this period indicates a change of dominant vegetation to C<inf loc=\"post\">4</inf> grasses. In agreement with other proxy data, such as deposition of evaporite minerals, we interpret this period to reflect the driest conditions in the region during the last 10.1\u00a0ka. This transition led to protracted late Holocene arid conditions after 4\u00a0ka with the presence of a permanent saline lake, supported by the sustained presence of tetrahymanol and more positive average \u03b4D<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values (\u2212122\u2030 to\u00a0\u2212141\u2030). A late Holocene peak of cyanobacterial biomarker input at 1.3\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP might represent an event of lake eutrophication, possibly due to human impact and the onset of cattle/livestock farming in the catchment.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0020\" view=\"all\">A unique feature of our record is the presence of a distinct transitional period between 4.8 and 4\u00a0cal\u00a0ka BP, which was characterized by some of the most negative \u03b4D<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values during the Holocene (up to\u00a0\u2212180\u2030), when all other proxy data indicate the driest conditions during the Holocene. These negative \u03b4D<inf loc=\"post\">wax</inf> values can as such most reasonably be explained by a shift in moisture source area and/or pathways or rainfall seasonality during this transitional period. We hypothesize that orbital induced weakening of the summer solar insolation and associated reorganization of the general atmospheric circulation, as a possible southward displacement of the tropical rainbelt, led to an unstable hydroclimate in central India between 4.8 and 4\u00a0ka.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0025\" view=\"all\">Our findings shed light onto the sequence of changes during mean state changes of the monsoonal system, once an insolation driven threshold has been passed, and show that small changes in solar insolation can be associated with major hydroclimate changes on the continents, a scenario that may be relevant with respect to future changes in the ISM system.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The studies were focused on the time period 16.2\u201310.0\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP, determined by 36 <sup loc=\"pre\">14</sup>C dates from the two sequences. A wide variety of proxies were used, including pollen and diatom analyzes, biogenic silica content, C and N analyzes, stable isotopes (<sup loc=\"pre\">13</sup>C and <sup loc=\"pre\">15</sup>N), elemental concentrations and magnetic susceptibility measurements, to detect environmental changes that can be related to shifts of the circulation belts of the Southern Ocean. In addition, climate model simulations were carried out. We find that the sediments are underlain by a &amp;gt;2\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP long hiatus, possibly representing a dried-out lake bed. The climate simulations corroborate that the area might have been exposed to arid conditions as a consequence of the Heinrich 1 event in the north and a southward displacement of the ITCZ. The development on the island after 16.2\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP is determined by the position of the Subtropical Front (STF) and the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW). The period 16.2\u201314.75\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP was characterized by varying influence from SHW and with STF situated south of Tristan da Cunha, ending with a humidity peak and cooler conditions. The stable conditions 14.7\u201314.1\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP with cool and fairly arid conditions imply that STF and SHW were both north of the islands during the first part of the Antarctic Cold Reversal. The most unstable period, 14.1\u201312.7\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP, indicates incessant latitudinal shifts of the zonal circulation, perhaps related to climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere and bipolar seesaw mechanisms as the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) varied. At 12.7\u00a0cal\u00a0ka\u00a0BP the Holocene warming began with a gradually drier and warmer climate as a result of a dampened AMOC during the Younger Dryas cooling in the north with ITCZ, STF and SHW being displaced southwards. Peak warming seems to have occurred in the earliest part of the Holocene, but this period was also characterized by humidity shifts, possibly an effect of retraction and expansion phases of SHW during AMOC variations in the north.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Certain diagnostic features, such as the confluence of the lacerum posterius and anterior condyloid foramina, and the long and lyre-shaped temporal ridges, allow this find to be established as the first occurrence of the Iberian lynx in Europe. The fossil described here was found in the Avenc Marcel cave (Vallirana, Barcelona, Spain) in association with many other Late Villafranchian faunal remains. The combined presence of the bovid genera <italic>Capra</italic> and <italic>Soergelia</italic>, and the rodent species <italic>Mimomys medasensis</italic> and <italic>Mimomys tornensis</italic>, allows the age of this deposit to be placed at about 1.6\u20131.7 Ma. Consequently, the appearance of <italic>Lynx pardinus</italic> is related here to the faunal turnover that occurred between the Middle and Late Villafranchian, considered to be one of the major changes in the European macromammal fauna. Such an early divergence is in accordance with the evolutionary split proposed by both the molecular data and with the glacial-interglacial dynamics that affected the European region during the Early Pleistocene. Under these circumstances, the Iberian lynx could have originated in isolation in the Iberian Peninsula (a recognized southern European refugium for several species), during one or more glacial episodes. In this time period, this species may also have developed a dependence on small-sized animal prey, such as the lagomorphs of the genus <italic>Prolagus</italic> and <italic>Oryctolagus</italic>, already widespread throughout the Iberian Peninsula by that point.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">In the present work, several topics regarding the earliest evolutionary history of <italic>Lynx pardinus</italic> are discussed. Understanding the events that took place surrounding the origins of this lineage can shed new light on the future conservation of this extremely threatened felid.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Proxies for peatland vegetation composition provide records of (local) environmental conditions that can be linked to both autogenic and allogenic factors. Analytical pyrolysis offers a molecular fingerprint of peat, and thereby a suite of environmental proxies. Here we investigate analytical pyrolysis as a method for biomarker analysis. Pyrolysates of 48 peatland plant species were compared, comprising seventeen lichens, three <italic>Sphagnum</italic> species, four non-<italic>Sphagnum</italic> mosses, eleven graminoids (Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Poaceae), five Ericaceae and six species from other families. This resulted in twenty-one potential biomarkers, including new markers for lichens (3-methoxy-5-methylphenol) and graminoids (ferulic acid methyl ester). The potential of the identified biomarkers to reconstruct vegetation composition is discussed according to their depth records in cores from six peatlands from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes. The occurrence of markers for <italic>Sphagnum</italic>, graminoids and lichens in all six studied peat deposits indicates that they persist in peat of thousands of years old, in different vegetation types and under different conditions. In order to facilitate the quantification of biomarkers from pyrolysates, typically expressed as proportion (%) of the total quantified pyrolysis products, an internal standard (5-\u03b1-androstane) was introduced. Depth records of the <italic>Sphagnum</italic> marker 4-isopropenylphenol from the upper 3\u00a0m of a <italic>Sphagnum</italic>-dominated peat, from samples analysed with and without internal standard showed a strong positive correlation (r<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.72, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0&amp;lt;\u00a00.0005, <italic>n</italic>\u00a0=\u00a012). This indicates that application of an internal standard is a reliable method to assess biomarker depth records, which enormously facilitates the use of analytical pyrolysis in biomarker research by avoiding quantification of a high number of products.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
