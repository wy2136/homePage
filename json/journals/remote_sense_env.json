In order to process this large amount of satellite images an almost automatic monitoring system was developed. With the Global Digital Elevation Map V2 (GDEM-V2) of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) an improved orthorectification was applied which, in combination with a destriping correction of the Landsat 7 products with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, leads to more precise flow-velocity information. In addition, outliers were removed using an adaptive, recursive filter approach. For the time span 1972\u20132012 more than 100,000 flow-velocity fields were derived from over 16,000 optical multi-sensoral Landsat scenes (Landsat 1 to Landsat 7) allowing the determination of the long-term flow-velocity trend. Moreover, the high temporal resolution facilitates the analysis of seasonal flow-velocity variations of numerous outlet glaciers. For many of the major outlet glaciers the results show an acceleration pattern that is consistent with most of the previously published analyses. However, the flow-velocity changes do not have a uniform pattern in their temporal and spatial distribution. This study provides both a high temporal densification and an extension of existing flow-velocity information of the GrIS margin. Finally, this processing chain in its generality allows for the determination of various types of surface displacements and can be applied to other glacier regions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Thus, it is important to obtain the information on urban scenes automatically from high-resolution remote sensing images. Previous studies have focused solely on obtaining qualitative labels of scenes (i.e., scene classification) as opposed to quantitative measurements on scenes (i.e., scene decomposition). However, scene classification alone cannot satisfy the demands of practical applications, as most scenes are mixed and composed of many categories. This study aims at 1) developing a decomposition model for quantifying mixed semantics of urban scenes, and 2) applying the proposed model to analyze urban functional zonings. For the first target, a Linear Dirichlet Mixture Model (LDMM) is proposed to quantify the relationships between pure scenes (including one single category) and mixed ones (including multiple categories). Since both mixed and pure scenes are characterized by frequency features (e.g., gray histograms of shapes), the variations in the quantization levels of frequency features could lead to different decomposition results. Accordingly, the stationary Markov process is further introduced to estimate the convergent decomposition results. For the second target, the LDMM was applied to obtain the qualitative categories and their quantitative proportions of urban scenes in Beijing and Zhuhai and to assess their spatial arrangements and temporal changes. Our methods were experimentally verified to be reliable and more effective in performance than the Linear Mixture Model and scene classification techniques. The case studies also suggested that Beijing and Zhuhai significantly differ in urban functional zonings and the functional zonings in Beijing have changed much over time, indicating an important transition in the city's economic structure.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Since the area surrounding Antarctica is largely unpolluted, LER changes can only be due to variations in the cloud cover and/or in the sea ice extension. In order to evaluate their influence on LER and assess the trend of the UV reflectivity under ice-free and various sea ice concentration (SIC) levels, we compared a multi-satellite-based LER dataset with different satellite observations of cloud cover and SIC for October to March from 1979 to 2012. Despite the high cloud fraction for most of this period, sea ice was found to be the main driver of LER variability and had a greater influence on LER variability than cloud cover. The cloud cover was lower in spring than in summer for all datasets, and this difference appears to be primarily associated with the sea ice extent. While an increment of the cloud fraction of 20% has been found to cause an increase in LER of up to 13 reflectivity units (RU) under ice-free conditions, this increase is halved under low SIC. In contrast, no significant changes in LER data were found under high SIC levels. The correlation between LER and SIC is evident when the latter is higher than approximately 30%. The best correlations (r) between LER and SIC were found for the Weddell Sea (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.87), the Ross Sea (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.85), and the Indian Ocean (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.90) for November, and for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.86) and the Pacific Ocean (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.83) for February and October, respectively. In contrast, no correlation was found in the proximity of the coastlines of west Antarctica in October. Overall, an enhancement of SIC from 0% to 100% results in a LER increase of 44<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU. This value is larger than the corresponding sea ice-induced increase computed for the observed and modeled shortwave albedos at the top of the atmosphere (21 and 13<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU, respectively). The LER data distributions for different regions and months show a marked seasonal double peak in reflectivity. The highest relative frequency is driven by the sea ice and peaks at approximately 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU, whereas the secondary peak of approximately 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU is dominated by cloudiness. Negative trends in the UV reflectivity of the grid cells characterized by a SIC greater than 30% were found for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (up to \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>3.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>1.0 per decade in March). Trends computed over the entire Southern Ocean for mid/high SIC bins are mostly negative, although are often not statistically significant. However, the trend in the reflectivity of the ice-free grid cells was generally positive, probably due to changes in the cloud amount/opacity.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, its ability to accurately map forest AGB changes in high-biomass tropical forests has seldom been investigated. Here, we assess the ability of repeated LiDAR acquisitions to map AGB stocks and changes in an old-growth Neotropical forest of French Guiana. Using two similar aerial small-footprint LiDAR campaigns over a four year interval, spanning ca. 20<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>, and concomitant ground sampling, we constructed a model relating median canopy height and AGB at a 0.25-ha and 1-ha resolution. This model had an error of 14% at a 1-ha resolution (RSE<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>54.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>) and of 23% at a 0.25-ha resolution (RSE<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>86.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>). This uncertainty is comparable with values previously reported in other tropical forests and confirms that aerial LiDAR is an efficient technology for AGB mapping in high-biomass tropical forests. Our map predicts a mean AGB of 340<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup> within the landscape. We also created an AGB change map, and compared it with ground-based AGB change estimates. The correlation was weak but significant only at the 0.25-ha resolution. One interpretation is that large natural tree-fall gaps that drive AGB changes in a naturally regenerating forest can be picked up at fine spatial scale but are veiled at coarser spatial resolution. Overall, both field-based and LiDAR-based estimates did not reveal a detectable increase in AGB stock over the study period, a trend observed in almost all forest types of our study area. Small footprint LiDAR is a powerful tool to dissect the fine-scale variability of AGB and to detect the main ecological controls underpinning forest biomass variability both in space and time.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

It is also known that global satellite products generally contain more noise than ground-based estimates. Data validation of satellite data often treats ground-based estimates as the \u2018gold standard\u2019: without error or uncertainty. In the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) however, ground-based estimates have considerable uncertainty, caused by the input components of the ET equations. This research presents an analysis of uncertainty of reference ET (ET<inf loc=\"post\">0</inf>) caused by these input components. A dataset of correlated random variables is generated for a country with a diverse climate and diverse density of ground observations: New Zealand. The uncertainty analysis shows that: ET<inf loc=\"post\">0</inf> is most sensitive to temperature, followed by solar radiation, relative humidity, and cloudiness ratio; and that uncertainty varies between 10% and 40% of ET<inf loc=\"post\">0</inf>, and depends on the ET<inf loc=\"post\">0</inf> value. Using this uncertainty analysis, a set of correlated random variables, and a Monte-Carlo fitting approach, MOD16 satellite PET data becomes a \u2018soft interpolator\u2019 between ground-based ET<inf loc=\"post\">0</inf> estimates.

The objective of this study was to propose and assess the use of a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that accommodates both residual spatial dependence and non-stationarity of model covariates through the introduction of spatial random effects. We explored this objective using four forest inventory datasets that are part of the North American Carbon Program, each comprising point-referenced measures of above-ground forest biomass and discrete LiDAR. For each dataset, we considered at least five regression model specifications of varying complexity. Models were assessed based on goodness of fit criteria and predictive performance using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Results showed that the addition of spatial random effects to the regression model intercept improved fit and predictive performance in the presence of substantial residual spatial dependence. Additionally, in some cases, allowing either some or all regression slope parameters to vary spatially, via the addition of spatial random effects, further improved model fit and predictive performance. In other instances, models showed improved fit but decreased predictive performance\u2014indicating over-fitting and underscoring the need for cross-validation to assess predictive ability. The proposed Bayesian modeling framework provided access to pixel-level posterior predictive distributions that were useful for uncertainty mapping, diagnosing spatial extrapolation issues, revealing missing model covariates, and discovering locally significant parameters.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In an effort to extend these capabilities to Landsat Multispectal Scanner (MSS) imagery, we introduce MSS clear-view-mask (MSScvm), an automated cloud and shadow identification algorithm for MSS imagery. The algorithm is specific to the unique spectral characteristics of MSS data, relying on a simple, rule-based approach. Clouds are identified based on green band brightness and the normalized difference between the green and red bands, while cloud shadows are identified by near infrared band darkness and cloud projection. A digital elevation model is incorporated to correct for topography-induced illumination variation and aid in identifying water. Based on an accuracy assessment of 1981 points stratified by land cover and algorithm mask class for 12 images throughout the United States, MSScvm achieved an overall accuracy of 84.0%. Omission of thin clouds and bright cloud shadows constituted much of the error. Perennial ice and snow, misidentified as cloud, also contributed disproportionally to algorithm error. Comparison against a corresponding assessment of the Fmask algorithm, applied to coincident TM imagery, showed similar error patterns and a general reduction in accuracy commensurate with differences in the radiometric and spectral richness of the two sensors. MSScvm provides a suitable automated method for creating cloud and cloud shadow masks for MSS imagery required for time series analyses in temperate ecosystems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Here we focus on SSTs from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and report a 99% significant correlation between the changes of in situ measured AMOC transport and the variation of 1-month leading SST anomalies in the subpolar North Atlantic region (45\u00b0N\u201370\u00b0N) based on analyses of an 85-month period. The leading mode of the singular value decomposition analysis of SST and Sea Level Pressure (SLP) for 31<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years (1981/12\u20132012/12) shows an apparent North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing on the SST fields. Specifically, the SST and SLP one-month phase lag covariance is notable at temporal scales of 4 to 11<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>months. After removing the first order component of the NAO, the residual SST (RESST) provides better estimates of the AMOC on a shorter time scale than the SST. This is because that RESST is less likely to be affected by the local SLP on these time scales. The high correlation is primarily between the RESST and variations of the geostrophic Upper Mid-Ocean transport component of the AMOC. The 31-year RESST time series in the North Atlantic subpolar region is also significantly correlated with the Gulf Stream path SST anomalies with a one-month lead, implying a fast signal transport from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Gulf Stream. A similar fast adjustment signal is also found in 500-year control simulations of the GFDL model CM2.1. These results indicate a prospective capability of satellite-derived SSTs to predict AMOC variability.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Modeling current and anticipated changes in the surface energy balance requires an understanding of the spatio-temporal interactions between LSTs and land cover, both of which can be monitored globally by measurements from space. This paper investigates the accuracy of the MODIS LST/Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km V005 product and its spatio-temporal sensitivity to land surface properties in a Canadian High Arctic permafrost landscape. The land cover ranged from fully vegetated wet sedge tundra to barren rock. MODIS LSTs were compared with in situ radiometer measurements from wet tundra areas collected over a 2-year period from July 2008 to July 2010 including both summer and winter conditions. The accuracy of the MODIS LSTs was \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C with a root mean square error of 3.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C over the entire observation period. Agreement was lowest during the freeze-back periods where MODIS LST showed a cold bias likely due to the overrepresentation of clear-sky conditions. A multi-year analysis of LST spatial anomalies, i.e., the difference between MODIS LSTs and the MODIS LST regional mean, revealed a robust spatio-temporal pattern. Highest variability in LST anomalies was found during freeze-up and thaw periods as well as for open water surface in early summer due to the presence or absence of snow or ice. The summer anomaly pattern was similar for all three years despite strong differences in precipitation, air temperature and net radiation. Summer periods with regional mean LSTs above 5.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C showed the greatest spatial diversity with four distinct 2.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C classes. Summer anomalies ranged from \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C to 2.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C with an average standard deviation of 1.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C. Dry ridge areas heated up the most, while wetland areas and dry areas of sparsely vegetated bedrock with a high albedo remained coolest. The observed summer LST anomalies can be used as a baseline against which to evaluate both past and future changes in land surface properties that relate to the surface energy balance. Summer anomaly classes mainly reflected a combination of albedo and surface wetness. The potential to use this tool to monitor surface drying and wetting in the Arctic should therefore be further explored. A multi-sensor approach combining thermal satellite measurements with optical and radar imagery promises to be an effective tool for a dynamic, process-based ecosystem monitoring scheme.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The heterogeneous glacier behavior in the WKM region was not only exemplified in the varying mass balances of individual glaciers but also the spatial variability of elevation trends over different glacier parts (accumulation\\ablation areas). Analysis of the heterogeneity shows that such glacier dynamics were probably associated with local glacier parameters including altitude, aspect, glacier hypsometry and ice flow.

In this study, an enhanced two-source evapotranspiration model for land (ETEML) is proposed based on a trapezoid framework of the vegetation fractional cover and land surface temperature (VFC/LST) space. In ETEML, a VFC/LST trapezoid space is theoretically defined for each pixel, and a pixel-wise mixed surface temperature decomposition method is proposed. ETEML is based on a two-source scheme, and the crop water stress index (CWSI) concept is applied to parameterize the soil evaporation and the vegetation transpiration separately. The proposed model was applied to the Soil Moisture\u2013Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) site in central Iowa, USA. Evaluation with a remotely sensed dataset from Landsat was carried out to assess the performance of ETEML. Compared with the tower observations, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the ETEML estimated latent heat flux (LE) are, respectively, 49<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 59<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>, comparable to retrieval accuracies published in other studies. Comparison between ETEML and variations on a simpler trapezoid interpolation model (TIM1 and TIM2) indicates that ETEML reduces the subjectivity and uncertainties involved in TIM1 and TIM2. Overall, the results suggest that ETEML is promising and can expand the application of the trapezoid framework-based ET modeling approaches to heterogeneous surfaces.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In extremely turbid waters (TSM<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>) however, these bands are less sensitive to increases in TSM. Here it is proposed to use Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) spectral bands between 1000 and 1300<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm for these extreme cases. This SWIR spectral region is subdivided into two regions, SWIR-I (1000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm to 1200<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm) and SWIR-II (1200<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm to 1300<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm) which correspond to local minima in the pure water absorption spectrum. For both spectral regions the water reflectance signal was measured <italic>in situ</italic> with an ASD spectrometer in three different extremely turbid estuarine sites: Scheldt (Belgium), Gironde (France), and R\u00edo de la Plata (Argentina), along with the TSM concentration. A measurable water reflectance was observed for all sites in SWIR-I, while in the SWIR-II region the signal was not significant compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of current Ocean Colour (OC) sensors. For the spectral band at 1020<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm (present in Ocean and Land Colour Instrument \u2014 OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3) and at 1071<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm, an empirical single band TSM algorithm is defined which is valid for both the Gironde and Scheldt estuarine sites. This means that a single algorithm can be applied for both sites without expensive recalibration. The relationship between TSM and SWIR reflectance at 1020 and 1071<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>nm is linear and did not show any saturation for the concentrations measured here (up to 1400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>), while saturation was observed for the NIR wavelengths, as expected. Hence, for extremely turbid waters it is advised to switch from NIR to SWIR-I wavelengths to estimate TSM concentration. This was demonstrated for an airborne hyperspectral dataset (Airborne Prism Experiment, APEX) from the Gironde estuary having several spectral bands in the SWIR-I. The empirical single band SWIR TSM algorithm was applied to the atmospherically corrected scene providing a TSM concentration map of the Gironde from mouth to more upstream with concentrations expected in this region ranging from a few to several hundreds mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>. These results, <italic>i.e.</italic> the existence of a single relationship for the Scheldt and Gironde, not showing any decrease of sensitivity, highlights the importance of having SWIR bands in future ocean colour sensors for studying extremely turbid rivers, coastal areas and estuaries in the world. A further implication of these results is that there is a TSM limit for application of atmospheric correction algorithms which assume zero SWIR marine reflectance. That limit is defined here as function of wavelength and sensor noise level.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A key concern for the CryoSat-2 orbit has been its long repeat period of 369<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days, which is usually undesirable for river and lake monitoring. However, the results from the method developed in this study involving virtual stations show that the CryoSat-2 data can indeed be used for such monitoring by utilizing the high spatial coverage and the sub-cycle period of 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days. The results show that it is possible to capture the peak flow occurring during late summer due to monsoonal precipitation and the melting of snow in the Himalayas. The evaluation of CryoSat-2 river levels is performed by comparing with Envisat data in terms of annual signals and amplitudes. The obtained annual amplitudes agree well with the Envisat data, although CryoSat-2 exhibit larger differences. For five virtual stations in the Brahmaputra River, the mean difference between the obtained amplitudes is ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cm, whereas the mean phase difference is less than 2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days.

The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> levels, a more prevailing NO<inf loc=\"post\">x</inf>-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> changes. The dominant NO<inf loc=\"post\">x</inf>-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>, HCHO, and O<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf> levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3%) and Forth Worth (0.5%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7%, 0.8%, and 7%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NO<inf loc=\"post\">x</inf> in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Recent developments in lidar instruments, computer processing power, and algorithm development have enabled the mapping of individual tree structure from lidar remote sensing, yet the utility of individual tree metrics has not been fully explored for aboveground biomass mapping. Conversely, scaling-based approaches using minimal data inputs have recently been presented as an alternative method for mapping regional biomass. We compare these two emerging avenues of lidar-based biomass mapping to plot-aggregated biomass modeling techniques. We assess three forested ecosystems: a mature, closed-canopy deciduous broadleaf forest; a mature evergreen needleleaf forest; and a Loblolly pine plantation with a range of even-aged stands. For individual tree based approaches, individual tree metrics improve explanatory power from R<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.57 to R<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.85 in the mature conifer site, but do not show statistically significant improvements in the other two sites. We suggest that with large field sample plots in areas of open canopy cover, individual tree metrics can significantly improve aboveground biomass (AGBM) estimation as they directly take into account stand density. Regarding scaling-based approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are currently unsuitable at local scales in forests without a tight relationship between canopy top height and basal area, as seen in two of our study areas.

In particular, information at the sub-field level is critical for detecting and combating within-field yield-limiting factors for implementation of precision agriculture. High-resolution optical satellite sensors are useful tools to acquire the necessary information in this regard. This study used multi-temporal RapidEye data to estimate the green effective plant area index (PAI) and leaf chlorophyll content of two field crops, spring wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) and canola (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.). The objective was to evaluate the capability of RapidEye imagery for detecting within-field variability of crop growth conditions. Field experiments were carried out in northern Ontario over two consecutive years, 2012 and 2013. Several vegetation indices were selected and derived from the RapidEye data to correlate with crop PAI measured using digital hemispherical photography and leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI) measured using a CCM-200 chlorophyll meter. Results showed that the effective PAI and CCI of the two crops were best correlated with different indices. For effective PAI, the modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2) was the best for spring wheat (R<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.74, RMSE<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.72 and n<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>200) whereas the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI<inf loc=\"post\">RE</inf>) was the best for canola (R<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.83, RMSE<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.49 and n<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>147).

Additionally estimating the proportion of area of each class based on the best assessment of ground condition (i.e., the reference classification) of the locations selected in the sample is often of interest for monitoring status and change in land cover. Stratified random sampling is a commonly used sampling design for accuracy assessment, and an important decision for this design is the allocation of sample size to the strata. In this article, the allocation that minimizes the sum of the variances of the estimators of user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and area of a single targeted class for a fixed total sample size is derived for stratified random sampling. For example, the targeted class might be a rare land-cover type such as wetland or in the case of a land-cover change assessment forest loss.

Recent severe, extensive, and synchronous bark beetle outbreaks have motivated research into methods for surveying the location, extent, and attack stage of outbreak using remotely sensed data. In this paper, we adapt methods for classing mountain pine beetle-induced tree mortality to detect spruce beetle-induced tree mortality from single-date high-resolution imagery and multi-date moderate-resolution data. We use freely available aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) to produce a tree-scale map of gray-stage spruce beetle kill across a broad spatial extent. This map was then used to train a stand-scale classification of spruce beetle outbreak from Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) data. Gray-stage spruce beetle outbreak was characterized by higher values of the red\u2013green index (RGI) at the tree-level. At the stand-level, gray stands were associated with high values of a Disturbance Index (DI) and low values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Both tree- and stand-scale classifiers of spruce beetle-attributed tree mortality were highly accurate (overall accuracy and user's accuracy for gray trees/stands greater than 88%). Stand-level classification improved with post-classification correction, which removed high-frequency year-to-year variability in forest condition. Comparison of high-resolution and moderate-resolution classified imagery revealed variable amounts of tree mortality occur in areas of landscape-scale spruce beetle outbreak. Our results highlight the utility of both ecologically informed post-classification correction and coupling fine-scale and moderate-scale resolution imagery for mapping and studying spruce beetle outbreaks.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this basin, floods occur relatively frequently and initial catchment storage is known to be key to runoff generation. The land surface model is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model is calibrated using the available streamflow records of 169 gauge stations across the Murray Darling Basin. The VIC soil moisture forecast is sequentially updated with observations from the SMOS Level 3 CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donn\u00e9es SMOS) soil moisture product using the Ensemble Kalman filter. The assimilation algorithm accounts for the spatial mismatch between the model (0.125\u00b0) and the SMOS observation (25<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km) grids. Three widely-used methods for removing bias between model simulations and satellite observations of soil moisture are evaluated. These methods match the first, second and higher order moments of the soil moisture distributions, respectively. In this study, the first order bias correction, i.e. the rescaling of the long term mean, is the recommended method. Preserving the observational variability of the SMOS soil moisture data leads to improved soil moisture updates, particularly for dry and wet conditions, and enhances initial conditions for runoff generation. Second or higher order bias correction, which includes a rescaling of the variance, decreases the temporal variability of the assimilation results. In comparison with in situ measurements of OzNet, the assimilation with mean bias correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the modeled soil moisture from 0.058<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>/m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup> to 0.046<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>/m<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup> and increases the correlation from 0.564 to 0.714. These improvements in antecedent wetness conditions further translate into improved predictions of associated water fluxes, particularly runoff peaks. In conclusion, the results of this study clearly demonstrate the merit of SMOS data assimilation for soil moisture and streamflow predictions at the large scale.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

For the retrieval the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/albedo processing scheme is employed. The comparatively high revisit frequency and high variability in angular sampling of the AVHRR sensors operated simultaneously onboard the different National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites contribute substantially to the success and quality of BRDF retrieval. The performance of the BRDF model for AVHRR data is assessed by comparison to MODIS BRDF retrievals, and the AVHRR BRDF reflectance data is validated against BRDF reflectance data from MODIS and in situ data gathered at three field sites in Switzerland. The comparison shows that the AVHRR BRDF retrievals are of high quality across most of Europe. The higher angular sampling of AVHRR allows for more full model retrievals of best quality and generates less fill values compared to MODIS. For most of the years investigated, the absolute accuracy of the AVHRR albedos is found to be within 0.05 throughout the complete seasonal cycle with a minimum bias at the peak of the growing season. However, they systematically underestimate the field-measured albedos, predominantly in winter due to spatial scale mismatch in combination with site heterogeneity and because the expression for the calculation of satellite-based blue-sky albedo does not account for multiple scattering. A slightly increased underestimation also occurs during vegetation senescence, presumably because of the narrow to broadband conversion employing only two bands. Overall, the results confirm the potential of AVHRR to produce multi-decadal data sets of reflectance anisotropy and albedo for use in climate monitoring and modeling studies. This offers a promising and unique opportunity to produce a BRDF/albedo climate data record from AVHRR dating back to 1985.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

These differences could be due to geographic variability in physical conditions (geology, climate, permafrost and hydrology) or in the data and methods used to extract water bodies. This study tested water extraction methods over the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, based on the Landsat 5 shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel and validated them using water extents obtained from 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m resolution orthophoto imagery. Methods included applying thresholds to generate binary land/water classifications, as well as deriving 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m water fractions from both linear unmixing and a new histogram breakpoint method. Results indicated that the histogram breakpoint method outperformed other methods, underestimating overall water fraction by 0.26% and overestimating the number of pure 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m water pixels by 0.66% compared to water fractions calculated from orthophotos. The breakpoint method was then applied to a stack of 17 near peak-of-season Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 images acquired between July 4 and August 18 from 1985 to 2011 to create a water fraction time-series for examining both trends and inter-annual variation in water extent.

Extensive processing at different scales of SAR satellite images (ERS and ENVISAT provided by ESA in the frame of a CAT-1 project) by means of A-DInSAR technique was performed. The time histories of ground displacements, have been analysed in combination with a detailed geological setting of the study area and with the hydrogeological changes occurred in the last decades (as the response to the anthropic stress) based on a large piezometric dataset. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to describe the space and time distributions of the subsidence process. The spatial pattern and deformation rate change is attributed to the following causes: i) the changes in the groundwater levels due to the intensification of mine exploitation (requiring dewatering operations) and ii) the distribution and thickness of recent compressible deposits. Specifically, it is derived that the groundwater level variations drive the timing of subsidence triggering over the area, whereas the local geological conditions control the magnitude of the deformation process.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Field plots are typically used to construct models that relate the variable of interest to explanatory variables derived from the remotely sensed data. The models may then be used in combination with the field plots to provide estimates for a geographical area of interest with corresponding estimates of precision using model-assisted estimators. Previous studies have shown that field plot sizes found suitable for pure field surveys may be sub-optimal for use in combination with remotely sensed data. Plot boundary effects, co-registration problems, and misalignment problems favor larger plots because the relative impact of these effects on the models of relationships may decline by increasing plot size. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha) a probability sample of 145 field plots was measured twice over an 11<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>year period (1998/1999 and 2010). For each plot, field measurements were recorded for two plot sizes (200<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 300/400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>). Corresponding multitemporal ALS (1999 and 2010) and InSAR data (2000 and 2011) were also available. Biomass for each of the two measurement dates as well as biomass change were modeled for all plot sizes separately using explanatory variables from the ALS and InSAR data, respectively. Biomass change was estimated using model-assisted estimators. Separate estimates were obtained for different methods for estimation of change, like the indirect method (difference between predictions of biomass for each of the two measurement dates) and the direct method (direct prediction of change). Relative efficiency (RE) was calculated by dividing the variance obtained for a pure field-based change estimate by the variance of a corresponding estimate using the model-assisted approach. For ALS, the RE values ranged between 7.5 and 15.0, indicating that approximately 7.5\u201315.0 as many field plots would be required for a pure field-based estimate to provide the same precision as an ALS-assisted estimate. For InSAR, RE ranged between 1.8 and 2.5. The direct estimation method showed greater REs than the indirect method for both remote sensing technologies. There was clearly a trend of improved RE of the model-assisted estimates by increasing plot size. For ALS and the direct estimation method RE increased from 9.8 for 200<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> plots to 15.0 for 400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> plots. Similar trends of increasing RE with plot size were observed for InSAR. ALS showed on average 3.2\u20136.0 times greater RE values than InSAR. Because remote sensing can contribute to improved precision of estimates, sample plot size is a prominent design issue in future sample surveys which should be considered with due attention to the great benefits that can be achieved when using remote sensing if the plot size reflects the specific challenges arising from use of remote sensing in the estimation. That is especially the case in the tropics where field resources may be scarce and inaccessibility and poor infrastructure hamper field work.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Three sub-regions of fold-and-thrust belt are the Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range, Kohat Plateau\u2013Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin\u2013Khisor Range. The difference in deformation intensity between these regions is mainly attributed to the presence, or absence, of an Infra-Cambrian salt layer. This study investigates the active tectonics of the Potwar Plateau and Salt Range region, emphasizing the role of salt, using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometry (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. Ten PALSAR images and four seismic profiles from western Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range region were used. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range is active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of around 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm/year. Two uplift anomalies were observed, which were interpreted as zones of transpression and salt diapirism. Time-migrated seismic profiles show that the salt layer acts as a detachment. Our results show that salt has different roles in different regions of the fold-and-thrust belt; in the Potwar Plateau region the salt layer acts as a detachment, while in Salt Range salt flow-induced structures are prominent. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation reveals that the deformation of western Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range is influenced by two main faults, the dextral Kalabagh fault and the Main Frontal Thrust. Finally, this work was compared to the Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt in western China due to their structural similarities.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, such estimation depends critically on an established relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground level PMs. In this study we performed an experiment at Xi'an to establish a relation between AOD and PM10. A first test of satellite AOD and PM10 data showed a low correlation between the two properties, especially in spring and summer seasons with relatively many high AOD values paired to low ground-level PM10 values, which hinted that AOD may \u2018contaminate\u2019 by summer agricultural burning season and dust storm intrusion leading to much elevated aerosol. MODIS fire count and CALIPSO vertical feature mask data were used to detect fire emissions and elevated aerosol to substantiate this hypothesis. A later test showed that the correlation between AOD and PM10 has strongly been improved by excluding the paired AOD-PM10 data with known biomass burning and elevated aerosol layers. This result indicates that summer agricultural burning and aloft aerosol should be considered when the AOD\u2013PM10 association is explored.

The approach consists of several procedures including field sample collections, high-resolution mapping of shrubland components using WorldView-2 imagery and regression tree models, Landsat 8 radiometric balancing and phenological mosaicking, medium resolution estimates of shrubland components following different climate zones using Landsat 8 phenological mosaics and regression tree models, and product validation.

Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost, which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map near-surface permafrost through decision and regression tree approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated medium-resolution (30-m<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout mainland Alaska. Our calibrated models (overall test accuracy of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>85%) were used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. Models indicate that near-surface permafrost underlies 38% of mainland Alaska and that near-surface permafrost will disappear on 16 to 24% of the landscape by the end of the 21st Century. Simulations suggest that near-surface permafrost degradation is more probable in central regions of Alaska than more northerly regions. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures. Additionally, warmer and drier conditions may increase fire activity and severity, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and carbon remobilization relative to climate alone. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Due to multiple, spatially and temporally varying influences on surface water temperature, (e.g., solar radiation, water depth, tidal stage, turbidity, and industrial activities) multi-temporal remote sensing observations might effectively be used to link these drivers with observations. However, while low- to moderate-resolution sensors provide temporally continuous observations, large pixel sizes have proven problematic in coastal regions where shoreline influences on pixel radiance contaminate the radiation signal leaving the water surface. To alleviate this problem, we used a dense stack of Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal imagery organized by day of year of acquisition, thus producing a climatology of water temperature. We use these data to analyze the spatial patterns of water surface temperature climatology (e.g., average maximum and minimum temperatures) for the past thirty years. We also explore the impact of power plant thermal effluent on water surface temperature climatology of the Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Finally, we divide the Landsat record into 5-year intervals, and calculate the water surface temperature climatology for each period. Trends in water surface temperature over the Landsat record were then compared against air temperature records available from coastal NOAA weather stations. The resulting data exhibit broad scale patterns, such as water surface climatology differences between the main stem of the Bay and its tributaries. The results also include the influence of urbanization and industrialization such as increases in impervious surface area and thermal effluent from power plants. Trends of increasing water surface temperature and air temperature were found for more than 92% of the Bay. While water temperature was always ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2\u20133\u00b0 cooler than the air temperature, water temperature has been increasing more rapidly than air temperature in some areas, particularly in the main stem of the Bay and in the Potomac estuary. Therefore, there is a detectable impact of global change on the Chesapeake Bay in the form of an increase in water temperature, which can only partially be explained by increasing air temperatures.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Efficient wind energy projects rely on accurate wind resource estimates, which are complex to obtain offshore due to the temporal and spatial sparseness of observations, and the potential for temporal data gaps introduced by the formation of ice during winter months, especially in freshwater lakes. For this study, in situ observations from 70 coastal stations and 20 buoys provide diurnal, seasonal, and interannual wind variability information, with time series that range from 3 to 11<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years in duration. Remotely-sensed equivalent neutral winds provide spatial information on the wind climate. NASA QuikSCAT winds are temporally consistent at a 25<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km resolution. ESA Synthetic Aperture Radar winds are temporally sparse but at a resolution of 500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. As an initial step, each data set is processed independently to create a map of 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m wind speeds. Buoy data are corrected for ice season gaps using ratios of the mean and mean cubed of the Weibull distribution, and reference temporally-complete time series from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Generalized wind climates are obtained for each buoy and coastal site with the wind model WAsP, and combined into a single wind speed estimate for the Great Lakes region. The method of classes is used to account for the temporal sparseness in the SAR data set and combine all scenes into one wind speed map. QuikSCAT winds undergo a seasonal correction due to lack of data during the cold season that is based on its ratio relative to buoy time series. All processing steps reduce the biases of the individual maps relative to the buoy observed wind climates. The remote sensing maps are combined by using QuikSCAT to scale the magnitude of the SAR map. Finally, the in situ predicted wind speeds are incorporated. The mean spatial bias of the final map when compared to buoy time series is 0.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/> <italic>ms</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup> and the RMSE 0.3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/> <italic>ms</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">\u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1</sup>, which represents an uncertainty reduction of 50% relative to using only SAR, and of 40% to using only SAR and QuikSCAT without in situ observations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, many elements contribute to the uncertainty of such estimate. In this study, the uncertainties of eight days gross primary production (GPP) predicted by Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were analysed at the site, ecosystem and European spatial scales. At the site level, the uncertainties caused by the missing of key drivers were evaluated. The most accurate predictions of eight days GPP were obtained when all available drivers were used (Pearson's correlation coefficient, \u03c1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>~<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.84; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>~<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>1.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g C m<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> d<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>).

Remotely sensed data were key drivers for the accurate prediction of GPP in ecosystems with high variability of green biomass over the phenological cycle (e.g., deciduous broad-leaved forests) or highly affected by the human management (e.g. croplands). In contrast, in the ecosystems with low variability of greenness (e.g., evergreen broad-leaved forests), the predictions were poor when meteorological information were not used. At a European spatial scale, when modelled grids of meteorological, land cover and fPAR data were used as inputs, the propagation of their uncertainty, not accounted in the models training, had significant effects on the uncertainty of the mean annual GPP. At this scale, the effects of meteorological uncertainty were higher than the misclassification error. These findings suggested that a strategy based on satellite-measured data could be a favourable improvement for the spatial upscaling of GPP, because avoiding the propagation of the uncertainties of the modelled grids.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The proposed methodology depends on choosing a proper deformation trend(s) to accurately describe the earthquake deformation signature by studying the deformation time series of a single GPS station. The modeled deformation trend is subtracted from the unwrapped phase maps to separate the main deformation signature from the imposed errors. Some deformation components, not described by the model(s), will leak to the residual phase maps which will be subjected to temporal and spatial filtering. The final corrected unwrapped phase maps are estimated by restoring the modeled deformation trend to the filtered residual phase maps and finally the deformation time series is estimated using a least squares technique. The proposed methodology was designed to retrieve complex and fine surface deformations in areas that have been affected by large dominating deformation signatures and contain at a least single GPS station. The methodology was tested using Envisat-ASAR C-band images and validation was carried out using GPS stations resulting in a mean RMS error of 6.9<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm.

The occurrence and dynamics of light-absorbing impurities affect ice surface characteristics and strongly influence glacier melt processes. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution of impurities and their impact on ice surface characteristics and the glacier's energy budget is still limited. We use imaging spectroscopy in combination with in-situ experiments to assess the composition of ice surface materials and their respective impact on surface albedo and glacier melt rates. Spectroscopy data were acquired in August 2013 using the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer and were used to map the abundances of six predominant surface materials on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Swiss Alps. A pixel-based classification revealed that about 10% of the ice surface is covered with snow, water or debris. The remaining 90% of the surface can be divided into three types of glacier ice, namely ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>7% dirty ice, ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>43% pure ice and ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>39% bright ice. Spatially distributed spectral albedo derived from APEX reflectance data in combination with in-situ multi-angular spectroscopic measurements was used to analyse albedo patterns present on the glacier surface. About 85% of all pixels exhibit a low albedo between 0.1 and 0.4 (mean albedo 0.29<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.12), indicating that Glacier de la Plaine Morte is covered with a significant amount of light-absorbing impurities, resulting in a strong ice-albedo feedback during the ablation season. Using a pixel-based albedo map instead of a constant albedo for ice (0.34) as input for a mass balance model revealed that the glacier-wide total ablation remained similar (10% difference). However, the large local variations in mass balance can only be reproduced using the pixel-based albedo derived from APEX, emphasizing the need to quantify spatial albedo differences as an important input for glacier mass balance models.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Far fewer studies, however, have been devoted to detailed analysis of F emission under steady-state conditions, which may be amenable to measurement by passive spectroradiometers onboard airborne or satellite missions. Here, we provide a random-effects meta-analysis of studies using both passively (sun-induced) and actively (e.g. laser-induced) measured steady-state F for detecting stress reactions in terrestrial vegetation. Specifically, we review behaviour of F in red and far-red wavelengths, and also the red to far-red F ratio, for plants physiologically stressed by water deficit, temperature extremes, and nitrogen insufficiency. Results suggest that water stress is, in general, associated with a decline in red and far-red F signal intensity measured at both leaf and canopy levels, whereas the red to far-red F ratio displays an inconsistent behaviour. Chilling, for which only studies with active measurements at the leaf level are available, significantly increased red and far-red F, whereas heat stress produced a less convincing decrease in both F emissions, notably in canopies measured passively. The clearest indicator of temperature stress was the F ratio, which declined significantly and consistently. The F ratio was also the strongest indicator of nitrogen deficiency, revealing a nearly uniformly increasing pattern driven by predominantly declining far-red F. Although significant knowledge gaps were encountered for certain scales and F measurement techniques, the analyses indicate that future airborne or space-borne acquisitions of both red and far-red F signals would be beneficial for timely detection of plant stress events.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this paper, we first revise the three-component model using a global dataset of surface phytoplankton pigment measurements. Then, using estimates of the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, we investigate the influence of ambient light on the parameters of the three-component model. We observe significant relationships between model parameters and the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, consistent with ecological knowledge. These relationships are incorporated explicitly into the three-component model to illustrate variations in the relationship between size-structure and total chlorophyll, ensuing from variations in light availability. The new model may be used as a tool to investigate modifications in size-structure in the context of a changing climate.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, only single broadband or multispectral data have been used in previous studies. In the present study, two methods are proposed to estimate the instantaneous land surface net shortwave radiation (NSR) with high spatial resolutions using hyperspectral remote sensing observations from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Method A calculates the NSR based on separate estimation of downward radiation and surface broadband albedo, which requires ancillary information for aerosol optical depth; and Method B directly estimates the NSR from the observed radiance. Results based on radiative transfer simulations showed that the use of hyperspectral data can significantly improve NSR estimation compared with the multispectral data method. Atmospheric water vapor correction was applied to adjust the surface radiation estimation. Validation of AVIRIS NSR estimates against ground measurements from two flux networks for the period of 2006\u20132014 showed that the two methods were similar and had consistent accuracy in the all-sky instantaneous NSR estimation with root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of approximately 28\u201356<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>. The pixel-based water vapor content estimation from AVIRIS data provided slightly different results than those obtained using coarse resolution remote sensing data. A simplified topographic correction algorithm was found to be able to improve the results generated from Method A; however, the degree of improvement provided by Method B was unclear, possibly because of the lack of consideration of horizontal atmospheric scattering effects from adjacent pixels. In general, hyperspectral remote sensing data have been shown to improve the NSR estimation accuracies compared with results obtained in previous studies. Additional efforts are needed to refine the NSR estimation for application to future satellite hyperspectral data.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Existing parameterization methods of estimating surface net radiation require the input of many surface and atmospheric parameters and rely heavily on the availability and accuracy of such data. Other methods involve retrieval of the shortwave (0.3\u20133.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcm) and longwave (3.0\u2013100.0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u03bcm) components separately from visible and shortwave infrared (VSWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) data, respectively. The proposed HyspIRI mission will carry a VSWIR spectrometer and a TIR multispectral imager with a nadir spatial resolution of 60<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. The broad range of spectral information will provide a unique opportunity to directly estimate the surface net radiation from the high-resolution HyspIRI data. In this study, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the clear-sky instantaneous all-wave net radiation over the land surface by combining VSWIR and TIR remote sensing data. The new method is based on extensive modeling of atmospheric radiative transfer over the entire solar spectrum. The algorithm is first tested with MODIS data. Validation with 1-year measurements at seven Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites in 2013 demonstrates that the new method can accurately estimate clear-sky instantaneous all-wave net radiation with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 70.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>, which is better than the method of separating shortwave and longwave components. MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) data from the HyspIRI preparatory airborne campaign are also used as a proxy to demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for data from the future HyspIRI mission.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
