        "description": "\n\nTsunamis can generate gravity waves propagating upward through the atmosphere, inducing total electron content (TEC) disturbances in the ionosphere. To capture this process, we have implemented tsunami-generated gravity waves into the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to construct a three-dimensional physics-based model WP (Wave Perturbation)-GITM. WP-GITM takes tsunami wave properties, including the wave height, wave period, wavelength, and propagation direction, as inputs, and time-dependently characterizes the responses of the upper atmosphere between 100 km and 600 km altitudes. We apply WP-GITM to simulate the ionosphere above the West Coast of the United States around the time when the tsunami associated with the March 2011 Tohuku-Oki earthquke arrived. The simulated TEC perturbations agree with Global Positioning System (GPS) observations reasonably well. For the first time, a fully self-consistent and physics-based model has reproduced the GPS-observed traveling ionospheric signatures of an actual tsunami event.",

        "description": "\n\n3D test-particle simulation of energetic electrons (hundreds of keV to MeV), including both an initially trapped population and continuously injected population, driven by the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global MHD model coupled with Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupler/Solver (MIX) boundary conditions, is performed for the March 17, 2013 storm. The electron trajectories are calculated and weighted using the ESA model for electron flux vs. energy and L. The simulation captures the flux dropout at both GOES-13 and GOES-15 locations after a strong CME-shock arrival which produced a Dst=\u2212132 nT storm, and recovery to the pre-storm value later, consistent with GOES satellite measurements. This study provides the first 3D test-particle simulation combining the trapped and injected populations. The result demonstrates that including both populations in the simulation is essential to study the dynamics of the outer radiation belt over the typical day-long timescale of ring current development, main phase and early recovery phase.",

        "description": "\n\nThe seasonal cycle of Arctic Ocean temperature is weak due to the insulating and light scattering effects of sea ice cover and the moderating influence of the seasonal storage and release of heat through ice melting and freezing. The retreat of sea ice and other changes in recent decades is already warming surface air temperatures in winter. These meteorological changes raise the question of how the seasonal cycle of the ocean may change. Here we present results from coupled climate model simulations showing that the loss of sea ice will dramatically increase the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature in the Arctic Ocean. Depending on the rate of growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases the seasonal range in Arctic sea surface temperature may exceed 10\u00b0C by year 2300, greatly increasing the stratification of the summer mixed layer.",

Observed California winter precipitation is highly correlated to a metric of extratropical cyclone activity over the Eastern Pacific. The lack of precipitation over the recent winters is coincident with consecutive winters of much below average cyclone activity. Analysis of variability in cyclone activity and California precipitation simulated by models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 indicates that most models can simulate the relationship between cyclone activity and precipitation well. Examination of projected change suggests 1) no evidence of a long-term downward trend in California-region cyclone activity within the examined scenarios; and 2) that the inter-model spread in California precipitation projection can be largely explained by the spread in the projection of extratropical cyclone activity. This highlights the need to further understand physical mechanisms for the variation in projection of cyclone activity in this region.",

Forecast of vegetation anomalies at 1\u20133 months lead time can help in decision making. Here, we show that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with other hydroclimatic variables (soil moisture and sea surface temperature) can be effectively used to predict vegetation anomalies in India. The spatiotemporal analysis of NDVI showed significant greening over the region during the period of 1982\u20132013. The root zone soil moisture showed a positive correlation with NDVI whereas the ENSO index (Nino 3.4) is negatively correlated in most of the regions. We extended this relationship to develop a model to predict NDVI in 1 to 3 months lead time. The predicted vegetation anomalies compare well with observations, which can be effectively utilized in early warning and better planning in water resources and agricultural sectors in India.",

However, a climatology of hurricane winds is lacking to date, largely because hurricanes are relatively rare events and difficult to observe over the open ocean. Here we present a new hurricane wind climatology based on objective surface wind analyses, which are derived from Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer measurements acquired by NOAA WP-3D and U.S. Air Force WC-130J hurricane hunter aircraft. The wind data were collected during 72 aircraft reconnaissance missions into 21 western Atlantic hurricanes from 1998\u20132012. This climatology provides an opportunity to validate hurricane intensity forecasts beyond the simplistic maximum wind speed metric and allows evaluating the predictive skill of probabilistic hurricane intensity forecasts using high-resolution model ensembles for the first time.

Recent work has shown that the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is responsible for phase-locking of peak ENSO development to the boreal winter, suggesting that this annual cycle may play a role in the spring predictability barrier. To test this hypothesis, the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is added to a damped, noise driven conceptual recharge oscillator model. When the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is included, a spring predictability barrier develops whereas without it ENSO predictability is independent of the forecast start date. When state-dependent noise is included in the simulations in addition to the annual cycle of the growth rate, the spring predictability barrier is enhanced and more realistic.",

In particular, the Labrador Sea appears well delineated into two regions on either side of the 60\u00b0N parallel, with very different climatological phytoplankton biomass cycles. Indeed, north of 60\u00b0N, an early and short spring bloom occurs in late April while south of 60\u00b0N, the bloom gradually develops one month later and significant biomass persists all summer long. Nevertheless, at climatological scale, the first-order mechanism that controls the bloom is identical for both bioregions. The light-mixing regime can explain the bloom onset in both bioregions. In the Labrador Sea, the blooms seem to rely on a mean community compensation irradiance threshold value of 2.5 mol photon.m\u22122.d\u22121 over the mixed layer.",

Previous seismic studies have used body waves to show that the top ~ 100km of the inner core is isotropic. However, radial anisotropy cannot be uniquely determined by body wave observations. Alternatively, normal mode centre frequencies are sensitive to spherically symmetric Earth structure, therefore may provide a constraint on the existence of radial anisotropy in the inner core. Here we show that normal mode centre frequency measurements are compatible with 2-5% radial anisotropy in the top ~100km of the inner core with a fast direction radially outwards and a slow direction along the ICB. Given the uncertainties in the mineral physics and processes that produce anisotropy, the observed radial anisotropy may be reconciled with predictions based on either solidification processes or from texturing due to anisotropic growth.",

Accuracy is assessed relative to observationally-validated reference models for fluxes under present-day conditions and forcing (flux changes) from quadrupled concentrations of carbon dioxide. Agreement among reference models is typically within 1 W/M2, while parameterized calculations are roughly half as accurate in the longwave and even less accurate, and more variable, in the shortwave. Absorption of shortwave radiation is underestimated by most parameterizations in the present day and has relatively large errors in forcing. Error in present-day conditions is essentially unrelated to error in forcing calculations. Recent revisions to parameterizations have reduced error in most cases. A dependence on atmospheric conditions, including integrated water vapor, means that global estimates of parameterization error relevant for the radiative forcing of climate change will require much more ambitious calculations.",

However, recent studies cast doubt on the validity of the paradigm and also on applying the widely used P-E (precipitation-evapotranspiration) metric over global land surfaces. Here we show in a comprehensive CMIP5-based assessment that projected changes in mean annual P-E are generally not significant, except for high-latitude regions showing wetting conditions until the end of the 21st century. Significant increases in aridity do occur in many subtropical, but also adjacent humid regions. However, combining both metrics still shows that ca. 70% of all land area will not experience significant changes. Based on these findings we conclude that the DDWW paradigm is generally not confirmed for projected changes in most land areas.",

Empirical evidence showing the relationship between fractal bed-topography and scaling of hyporheic travel-times is still lacking. We performed experiments to make high resolution observations of streambed topography and solute transport over naturally-formed sand bedforms in a large laboratory flume. We analyzed the results using both numerical and theoretical models. We found that fractal properties of the bed topography do indeed affect solute residence time distributions. Overall, our experimental, numerical and theoretical results provide evidence for a coupling between the sand-bed topography and the anomalous transport scaling in rivers. Larger bedforms induced greater hyporheic exchange and faster porewater turn-over relative to smaller bedforms, suggesting that the structure of legacy morphology may be more important to solute and contaminant transport in streams and rivers than previously recognized.",

A semi-stationary, high-pressure system north of the Bering Strait forced northward advection of warm, moist air from the continent. Air-mass transformation over melting sea ice formed a strong, surface-based temperature inversion in which dense fog formed. This induced a positive net longwave radiation at the surface, while reducing net solar radiation only marginally; the inversion also resulted in downward turbulent heat flux. The sum of these processes enhanced the surface energy flux by an average of ~15 W m\u22122 for a week. Satellite images before and after the episode show sea-ice concentrations decreasing from > 90% to ~50% over a large area affected by the air-mass transformation.

Warmer bottom water similar to modified circumpolar deep water (mCDW) is observed in winter and in early summer. The LSSW and mCDW may be drawn from the Drygalski Basin, as the HSSW pool retreats poleward from the shelf break in response to increased winter polar easterlies allowing these less dense overlying waters to spill into the deep ocean within the benthic layer.

It is demonstrated here that such a three-layer vortex model in so-called compensated state (without rotation in the deep layer) possesses smaller lower interface slope than the two-layer model that reduces the potential vorticity gradient in the lower layer and provides with less unstable configurations. Numerical simulations of an unstable cyclone with parameters typical for cold-core ring Bob reveal strong deformations and pulsations of the vortex core in the two-layer setup, while the ring becomes only slightly deformed and looks stable when the middle layer with uniform potential vorticity is added to be consistent with observations. Enhanced vortex stability in such three-layer setup has important implications for further studies of real-ocean eddies.",

We deconvolved 400 s waveforms of the ACROSS signal at nearby stations by a known source time function, and stacked the results based on the time relative to individual eruptions and the eruption intervals; the quantities obtained by this procedure are Green functions corresponding to various stages of the eruptive activity. We found an energy decrease in the later phase of the Green functions in active eruptive periods. This energy decrease, localized in the 2\u20136 s window of the Green functions, is difficult to explain by contamination from volcanic earthquakes and tremors. The decrease could be more reasonably attributed to a subsurface structure change caused by the volcanic activity.",

Results show that antecedent soil moisture is as important as concurrent ENSO condition in controlling rainfall anomalies over the U.S., but they generally dominate in different seasons with SST providing more predictability during winter while soil moisture, through its linkages to evapotranspiration and snow water, has larger influence in spring and early summer. The proposed methodology is applicable to climate model outputs to evaluate the intensity of land-atmosphere coupling and its relative importance.",

During the nighttime, aqSOA formation was evident as WSOCg increasingly partitioned to the particle phase with increasing relative humidity (RH).

Across the entire RH range encountered, there was no statistically-significant difference in WSOCp concentrations through the dry and ambient channels, indicating that the aqSOA remained in the condensed phase upon the evaporation of aerosol water.

This means that for the same level of solar wind driver parameters (electric field, epsilon, or other), different combinations of V and BZ will produce different driving at the magnetopause.

We show that trends in SAM are due partly to external forcing, but are not outside the natural variability as described by these models. Trends in jet location and magnitude, however, lie outside the unforced natural variability but can be explained by a combination of natural variability and the ensemble-mean forced trend.

The models exhibit a two-way interaction. While the plume conduit increasingly tilts away from the trench as a result of slab rollback-induced toroidal mantle flow, the slab subduction rate decreases as a function of the amount of plume buoyancy opposing that of the slab, which gets subducted beneath the slab. We propose that our models apply to the Hainan-Manila system and explain the recently imaged tilt of the Hainan plume by the Manila slab-induced mantle return flow.

One particular type of organization is the spatial self-aggregation of convection, taking the form of cloud clusters, or tropical cyclones in the presence of rotation. We show that several physical processes can give rise to self-aggregation, and highlight the key features responsible for it using idealized simulations. Longwave radiative feedbacks yield a \u201cradiative aggregation\" . In that case, sufficient spatial variability of radiative cooling rates yields a low-level circulation, which induces the up-gradient energy transport and radiative-convective instability. Not only do vertically-integrated radiative budgets matter, but the vertical profile of cooling is also crucial. Convective aggregation is facilitated when downdrafts below clouds are weak (\u201cmoisture-memory aggregation\" ), and this is sufficient to trigger aggregation in the absence of longwave radiative feedbacks. These results shed some light on the sensitivity of self-aggregation to various parameters, including resolution or domain size.",

        "description": "\n\nMountain glaciers comprise a small and widely distributed fraction of the world's terrestrial ice, yet their rapid losses presently drive a large percentage of the cryosphere's contribution to sea level rise. Regional mass balance assessments are challenging over large glacier populations due to remote and rugged geography, variable response of individual glaciers to climate change, and episodic calving losses from tidewater glaciers. In Alaska, we use airborne altimetry from 116 glaciers to estimate a regional mass balance of \u221275\u00b111 Gt yr\u22121 (1994\u20132013). Our glacier sample is spatially well-distributed, yet pervasive variability in mass balances obscures geospatial and climatic relationships. However, for the first time, these data allow the partitioning of regional mass balance by glacier type. We find that tidewater glaciers are losing mass at substantially slower rates than other glaciers in Alaska and collectively contribute to only 6% of the regional mass loss.",

However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that can significantly influence the rate ofbasal melting of Antarctic marine ice shelves and the associated SLR have not previously been considered. Here we use a fully-coupled global climate model to investigate whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations after a period of global warming could preserve Antarctic ice sheets by cooling subsurface ocean temperatures. We contrast this climate engineering method with an alternative strategy in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract surface and upper level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing GHGs, resulting in continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves, especially in the vicinity of the already unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. By contrast, removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica.",

The Northern Hemisphere (NH) tropics expand polewards nearly linearly as BC radiative forcing increases (0.70 W\u22121 m2), indicating that a realistic representation of BC could reduce GCM biases. We find support for the mechanism where BC induced midlatitude tropospheric heating shifts the maximum meridional tropospheric temperature gradient polewards resulting in tropical expansion.

Recently, it has been proposed that the density and sound velocities, in particular shear wave velocity, in the Earth's inner core are reconciled with Fe7C3, but such properties could be explained by \u03b2-Fe7N3 equally well. It is therefore possible that the inner core consists of Fe7(C,N)3, which is found as diamond inclusions and likely stable under inner core conditions.",

Our results confirm that the barrier may slow down or stop coseismic ruptures, but may also induce supershear ruptures. We demonstrate that the supershear rupture may emerge in a region that is delineated by two approximate linear boundaries. If the barrier size is below the lower boundary, ruptures can overcome the barrier and propagate at subshear speeds. If the barrier size is larger than the upper boundary, ruptures are always stopped by the barrier. Furthermore, we find that the barrier-induced supershear ruptures may eventually slow down into subshear speed, depending on the size and the location of the barrier. The duration of supershear ruptures increases as the barrier sizes grow from the lower to the upper boundary, which are proportional to the reduction in rupture speeds caused by the barrier. These results indicate that a barrier on the fault may not stop coseismic ruptures. Rather, the barrier may induce ruptures propagating at supershear speeds that play important roles in near-field ground shaking and damage.",

To determine the impact of this accelerating meltwater flux on Baffin Bay, we examine 8 numerical experiments using an ocean-sea-ice model: NEMO. Enhanced runoff causes shoreward-increasing sea surface height and strengthens the stratification in Baffin Bay. The changes in sea surface height reduces the southward transport through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and strengthens the gyre circulation within Baffin Bay. The latter leads to further freshening of surface waters as it produces a larger northward surface freshwater transport across Davis Strait. Increasing the meltwater runoff leads to a warming and shallowing of the West Greenland Irminger Water on the northwest Greenland shelf. These warmer waters can now more easily enter fjords on the Greenland coast and thus provide additional heat to accelerate the melting of marine terminating glaciers.",

Previous inversion techniques have been limited by the use of a 1-D Green's function in a free- or half-space, which depends only on the source-receiver distance and neglects volcanic topography. Our method exploits full 3-D Green's functions computed by a numerical method that takes into account realistic topographic scattering. We apply this method to vulcanian eruptions at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Our inversion results produce excellent waveform fits to field observations and demonstrate that full 3-D Green's functions are necessary for accurate volume flux inversion. Conventional inversions without consideration of topographic propagation effects may lead to large errors in the source parameter estimate. The presented inversion technique will substantially improve the accuracy of eruption source parameter estimation (c.f., mass eruption rate) during volcanic eruptions and provide critical constraints for volcanic eruption dynamics and ash dispersal forecasting for aviation safety. Application of this approach to chemical and nuclear explosions will also provide valuable source information (e.g., the amount of energy released) previously unavailable.",

This partly arises from the complex Agulhas leakage, which occurs via rings, cyclones and non-eddy flux. Hindcast simulations suggest leakage has recently increased, but have not decomposed this signal into its constituent mechanisms. Here, these are isolated in a realistic ocean model. Increases in simulated leakage are attributed to stronger eddy and non-eddy driven transports, and a strong warming and salinification, especially within Agulhas rings. Variability in both regimes is associated with strengthening Indian Ocean westerly winds, reflecting an increasingly positive Southern Annular Mode. While eddy and non-eddy flux signals are tied through turbulent eddy dissipation, the ratio between the two varies decadally. Consequently, while altimetry suggests a recent increase in retroflection turbulence and implied leakage, non-eddy flux may also play a significant role in modulating the leakage-AMOC connection.",

With a dual modeling approach we reconstruct its contemporary stratification by geochemical solute transport fundamentals, and show that thermal convection is required to maintain mixing in the brine and mud layer. The origin of the Urania basin stratification was dated to 1650 years before present, which may be linked to a major earthquake in the region.

We conclude that real-time GPS seismic waveforms can be used to rapidly determine magnitude, typically within the first minute of rupture initiation and in many cases before the rupture is complete. While slower than earthquake early warning methods that rely on the first few seconds of P-wave arrival, our approach does not suffer from the saturation effects experienced with seismic sensors at large magnitudes.

The leading mode of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of occurrence frequency of MJO phases shows an out-of-phase relationship between MJO phase 7 and phases 3\u20135. During winters when the MJO convection occurs more frequently in the Indian Ocean (phases 3\u20135), a winter-mean positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) tends to occur.

The atmospheric decline at northern mid-latitudes can largely be explained by decreasing North Atlantic oceanic evasion. The mid-latitude atmospheric signal propagates to the Arctic but is there countered by rapid Arctic warming and declining sea ice, which suppresses deposition and promotes oceanic evasion over the Arctic Ocean. The resulting simulation implies a decline of Hg in the Arctic surface ocean that we estimate to be -0.67% yr-1 over the study period.

It has been also pointed out that pitch angle scattering of ~keV electrons by whistler mode waves results in diffuse auroras. Thus, it is natural to expect relativistic electron precipitations associated with diffuse auroras. Based on a conjugate observation between the SAMPEX spacecraft and the all-sky TV camera at Syowa Station, we report, for the first time, a case in which relativistic electron precipitations are associated with diffuse aurora. The SAMPEX observation shows that the precipitations of >1\u2009MeV electrons are well accompanied with those of >150 and >400\u2009keV electrons. This indicates that electrons in the energy range from several keV to >1\u2009MeV precipitate into the atmosphere simultaneously. Our result supports the idea that whistler mode waves contribute to both generation of diffuse auroras and relativistic electron precipitations.",

        "description": "\n\nThe long-term warming from an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 is often assumed to be proportional to the forcing associated with that increase. This paper examines this linear approximation using a zero-dimensional energy balance model with a temperature-dependent feedback, with parameter values drawn from physical arguments and general circulation models. For a positive feedback temperature dependence, warming increases Earth's sensitivity, while greater sensitivity makes Earth warm more. These effects feed on each other, amplifying warming. As a result, for reasonable values of feedback temperature dependence and preindustrial feedback, Earth can jump to a warmer state under only one or two CO2 doublings. The linear approximation breaks down in the long tail of high climate sensitivity commonly seen in observational studies. Understanding feedback temperature dependence is therefore essential for inferring the risk of high warming from modern observations. Studies that assume linearity likely underestimate the risk of high warming.",

Here we use long-term temperature data (1970\u20132010) from 26 lakes around the world to show that climate change has altered lake stratification globally and that the magnitudes of lake stratification changes are primarily controlled by lake morphometry (mean depth, surface area, and volume) and mean lake temperature. Deep lakes and lakes with high average temperatures have experienced the largest changes in lake stratification even though their surface temperatures tend to be warming more slowly. These results confirm that the nonlinear relationship between water density and water temperature, and the strong dependence of lake stratification on lake morphometry makes lake temperature trends relatively poor predictors of lake stratification trends.",

We develop a new method using the passive tracer spice, to estimate Agulhas leakage transport in an ocean eddy-resolving climate model that properly captures Agulhas Retroflection and leakage. We identify Agulhas leakage waters as positive spice anomalies (\u2265\u2009+0.1) and are able to trace leakage to depths greater than 1000\u2009m. Spice-based Eulerian Agulhas leakage captures spikes in Lagrangian leakage transport which coincide with the passage of Agulhas rings, yielding a statistically significant correlation (0.47). On interannual times scales, differences between Eulerian and Lagrangian transports are reduced and correlation increases to 0.77.

These field-aligned currents are seen to move poleward through the radar field of view and to affect the observed ionosphere. The upward field-aligned current (FAC) is responsible, at least in part, for the heating of the ionospheric electrons. It is less clear whether the downward FAC cools the ionosphere.

Here we explore warming-elevation relationships using records from 2660 meteorological stations and determine that the vertical gradient of warming rate varies with location. The warming is faster at higher altitudes in Asia and western North America, but the opposite is observed over Central Europe and eastern North America which have received more short-wave radiation (brightening) associated with a decrease of aerosols and clouds since the 1980s.

The observed spatial pattern of surface displacements can only be reproduced by finite element models of postseismic deformation in elastic over viscoelastic crust that include lateral differences in both the thickness of the elastic layer and the viscosity of the viscoelastic layer. Solutions reproducing the sign of horizontal displacements everywhere in the epicentral region also require afterslip on the portion of the fault dislocation in the viscoelastic layer but not in the elastic lid. Although there are substantial tradeoffs among contributions to postseismic displacements of the surface, the observations preclude both crustal homogeneity and shallow afterslip. In the best family of solutions, the thickness of the elastic upper crust differs by a factor of 5 and the viscosity of the middle and lower crust by an order of magnitude between domains north and south of a suture zone containing the Main Boundary Thrust and Main Mantle Thrust.",

BBA increases Amazon basin annual mean diffuse radiation by 3.4\u20136.8% and net primary production (NPP) by 1.4\u20132.8%, with quoted ranges driven by uncertainty in BBA emissions.

Specifically, we demonstrate that stratification and chlorophyll are simultaneously influenced by shifts in the horizontal advective inputs of cold/saline/nutrient-rich waters from upwelling regions to the east and warm/fresh/nutrient-poor waters to the west. We find that horizontal advection contributes substantially to the annual surface layer nutrient budget and, together with vertical advection, significantly impacts interannual variability in chlorophyll.

Linear trends of snow and ice freeboard measurements from buoys and nearby CryoSat-2 freeboard retrievals are calculated during accumulation events.

The forecasts differ substantially from observed data for key hydrological variables. In addition, imbalanced surface water budgets, mostly caused by data assimilation, were found on both global (P-E) and basin scales (P-E-R), with the latter being more important.

        "description": "\n\nThe Bartlett Springs Fault (BSF), the easternmost branch of the northern San Andreas Fault system, creeps along much of its length. Geodetic data for the BSF are sparse, and surface creep rates are generally poorly constrained. The two existing geodetic slip rate inversions resolve at least one locked patch within the creeping zones. We use the 3-D finite element code FaultMod to conduct dynamic rupture models based on both geodetic inversions, in order to determine the ability of rupture to propagate into the creeping regions, as well as to assess possible magnitudes for BSF ruptures. For both sets of models, we find that the distribution of aseismic creep limits the extent of coseismic rupture, due to the contrast in frictional properties between the locked and creeping regions.",

Here we report the first results from an electromagnetic noise survey of the sky. The locations of electromagnetic noise sources are mapped on the hemisphere above a distributed array of wideband receivers that operate in a small aperture configuration. It is found that the noise sources can be localized at elevation angles up to \u223c60\u00b0 in the sky, well above the horizon. The sky also exhibits zones with little or no noise that are found toward the local zenith and the southwest of the array. These results are obtained by a rigorous analysis of the residuals from the classic dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves using an array analysis of electric field measurements in the frequency range from \u223c20 to 250\u2009kHz. The observed locations of the noise sources enable detailed observations of ionospheric modification, for example, caused by particle precipitation and lightning discharges, while the observed exclusion zones enable the detection of weak natural electromagnetic emissions, for example, from streamers in transient luminous events above thunderclouds.",

Combined with previous synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy results, we have found that the occurrence of the low-spin Fe3+ in the octahedral sites (B site) of bridgmanite has produced a 0.5(\u00b10.1)% reduction in the unit cell volume at 18\u201325\u2009GPa and has increased the isothermal bulk modulus to 284(\u00b14) GPa, consistent with recent theoretical calculations. Together with literature results, we note that the addition of Fe can cause an increase in the density, bulk modulus, and bulk sound velocity in both Al-free and Al-bearing bridgmanite at lower mantle pressures. The presence of Fe3+ in the B site of bridgmanite can further enhance this increase. The observed spin transition of B site Fe3+ in bridgmanite is thus important for understanding the density and velocity structures of the lower mantle.",

Thermocline depth anomalies have been found to lead SST anomalies in time with a longitude-dependent delay, but our study also suggests that the relationship shows considerable seasonal dependency and is strongest (weakest) during the boreal spring (summer). Over the eastern equatorial Pacific where there is least delay (compared to that in the western and central Pacific), the connection between thermocline and SST is the weakest during the boreal spring. This feature may be one of causes for ENSO spring persistence barrier. Furthermore, the thermocline-SST connections exhibit significant decadal variations, which are remarkably consistent with the decadal changes in the persistence barrier of SST anomalies over the eastern Pacific. It is also found that the decadal shift in the timing of the thermocline-SST connection barrier is caused by the changes in the seasonal cycle of tropical trade winds and thermocline depths.",

Sensitivity experiments with an ocean circulation and biogeochemistry model illustrates the impacts of the wind and buoyancy forcings under a warming climate. Intensified and poleward shifted westerly wind strengthens the upper overturning circulation, not only leading to an increased uptake of anthropogenic CO2 but also releasing biologically regenerated carbon to the atmosphere. Freshening of Antarctic Surface Water causes a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to an increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage. The rectified effect of these processes operating together is the sustained growth of the carbon storage in the Southern Ocean, even under the warming climate with a weaker global ocean carbon uptake.",

The magnetic perturbation ahead of them, often referred to as a dipolarization front (DF), is asymmetric with a small Bz dip followed by a sharp Bz enhancement. The Bz dip is thought to be generated from dawnward currents carried by DF-reflected ions; after reflection, these earthward moving ions gyrate clockwise and contribute to dawnward diamagnetic currents ahead of the front. Using observations of hundreds of DFs, we investigate this hypothesis. We find that the depth of the Bz dip as a function of the front azimuth depends on DF propagation speed and ambient plasma density. These statistical signatures support the hypothesis that the Bz dip is caused by ion reflection and suggest that secondary currents carried by these reflected ions can reshape the front significantly.",

The electronically excited O(1D) atom is subsequently deactivated by collisions with N2 in a fast spin-forbidden ET process that leaves the N2 molecule with an average of 2.2 vibrational quanta. Finally, the vibrational excitation of N2 is transferred by a fast, near-resonant vibration-to-vibration ET process to the asymmetric stretch (v3) mode of CO2, which promptly radiates near 4.3\u2009\u00b5m.",

The topographic alignment of salt deposits has been speculated to indicate an endogenic sourcing of the material. Two-way transport of salts from a liquid-water ocean beneath the ice shell to the surface, and vice versa, has been speculated. We present dynamical models that demonstrate the incorporation of newly frozen ice into convective plumes within the ice shell, caused by convection within the ice shell that drives dynamic topography along the ice-ocean boundary. The new ice that forms at the freezing front can be transported by the rising ice plumes toward the surface until it is blocked by a high-viscosity lid at the surface. Weakening of the lid by tidal or tectonic forces could then lead to the surface detection of ocean trace chemistry captured in the newly formed ice.",

In northeast Tibet, depth-consistent NW-SE directions imply coupled deformation throughout the whole lithosphere, possibly also involving the underlying asthenosphere. Significant anisotropy at depths of 225\u2009km in southeast Tibet reflects sublithospheric deformation induced by northward and eastward lithospheric subduction beneath the Himalaya and Burma, respectively. The multilayer anisotropic surface wave model can explain some features of SKS splitting measurements in Tibet, with differences probably attributable to the limited back azimuthal coverage of most SKS studies in Tibet and the limited horizontal resolution of the surface wave results.",

To overcome limitations in capturing the full spectrum of past temperature variability, we present a network of 15 maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies distributed across the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Independent subsets of continental-scale records consistently reveal high MXD before 1580 and after 1910, with below average values between these periods. Reconstructed extratropical summer temperatures reflect not only these long-term trends but also distinct cooling pulses after large volcanic eruptions. In contrast to TRW-dominated reconstructions, this MXD-based record indicates a delayed onset of the Little Ice Age by almost two centuries. The reduced memory inherent in MXD is likely responsible for the rapid recovery from volcanic-induced cooling in the fourteenth century and the continuation of warmer temperatures until ~1600.",

However, much uncertainty remains about how land surface fluxes influence the initiation of deep convection locally. While some studies consider only atmospheric and soil profiles, in a one-dimensional sense, others have argued that horizontal variability in fluxes plays an important role in convective triggering, via mesoscale circulations. This paper presents the first comprehensive observational analysis over Europe linking convective initiation to soil moisture, based on satellite observations of cloud top and land surface temperature, and soil moisture. The results show that convective initiations are favored on the downwind side of dry surfaces, close to wetter areas. The signal is clearest following dry periods and under light winds, consistent with forcing by a mesoscale circulation. Overall, the detected signal in Europe is weaker than in previous Sahelian analysis, but key spatial characteristics are essentially the same.",

Using back trajectories to estimate the transport time indicates that BrC aerosol light absorption decayed in the plumes with a half-life of 9 to 15 h, measured over day and night.

The data show that aspect ratio depends on riming extent but that orientation is only weakly dependent on the degree of riming and on particle size. Instead, more vertical orientations for frozen particles become increasingly common with higher turbulence.

These marked variations were largely controlled by seasonal changes in vertical mixing and thermocline depth, both of which determine the degree of entrainment of CO2-rich corrosive waters from deeper depths. Our MLR-based subsurface \u03a9AR climatology is complementary to surface climatology based on pCO2 measurements.",

        "description": "\nAnthropogenic carbon dioxide uptake varies across Earth System Models for reasons that have remained obscure. When varied within a single model, the lateral eddy mixing coefficient ARedi produces a range of uptake similar to the modeled range. The highest uptake, resulting from a simulation with a constant ARedi of 2400\u2009m2/s, simulates 15% more historical carbon uptake than a model with ARedi\u2009=\u2009400\u2009m2/s. A sudden doubling in carbon dioxide produces a 21% range in carbon uptake across the models. Two spatially dependent representations of ARedi produce uptake that lies in the middle of the range of constant values despite predicting very large values in the subtropical gyres. One-dimensional diffusive models of the type used for integrated assessments can be fit to the simulations, with ARedi accounting for a substantial fraction of the effective vertical diffusion. Such models, however, mask significant regional changes in stratification and biological carbon storage.",

        "description": "\nRecent observations reveal a paradox of anaerobic respiration occurring in seemingly oxic-saturated sediments. Here we demonstrate a residence time-based explanation for this paradox. Specifically, we show how microzones favorable to anaerobic respiration processes (e.g., denitrification, metal reduction, and methanogenesis) can develop in the embedded less mobile porosity of bulk-oxic hyporheic zones. Anoxic microzones develop when transport time from the streambed to the pore center exceeds a characteristic uptake time of oxygen. A two-dimensional pore-network model was used to quantify how anoxic microzones develop across a range of hyporheic flow and oxygen uptake conditions. Two types of microzones develop: flow invariant and flow dependent. The former is stable across variable hydrologic conditions, whereas the formation and extent of the latter are sensitive to flow rate and orientation. Therefore, pore-scale residence time heterogeneity, which can now be evaluated in situ, offers a simple explanation for anaerobic signals occurring in oxic pore waters.",

The amplitude of H2O variation related to the QBO amounts to 0.5\u2009ppmv. The additional effect of MWs reaches its maximum about 2\u20134\u2009weeks after the central date of the MW and strongly depends on the QBO phase. Whereas during the easterly QBO phase there is a pronounced drying of about 0.3\u2009ppmv about 3\u2009weeks after the MW, the impact of the MW during the westerly QBO phase is smaller (about 0.2\u2009ppmv) and more diffusely spread over time.

A new measure that considers the timing of processes is suggested for evaluating the optimal conditions for maximum rain yield. These conditions are linked to an optimal aerosol concentration (Nrain_op), which drives similar time intervals to maximum collected mass and to maximum vertical development. Nrain_op is a function of cloud size and thermodynamic conditions. Giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) impact was shown before to precede the initiation of collision-coalescence and to increase the amount of rain from polluted clouds.

The TTD shape parameter \u0394/\u0393 is thus larger in the SH tropics than at middle and high SH latitudes. Our analysis introduces a simple path-dependent lifetime that parameterizes chemical losses.

This is at odds with observed high N2 fixation rates in the oligotrophic North Atlantic where the ratio of nutrients supplied to the surface is elevated in N relative to the average R (16:1). In this study, we investigate several mechanisms to solve this puzzle: iron limitation, phosphorus enhancement by preferential remineralization or stoichiometric diversity of phytoplankton, and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) utilization. Combining resource competition theory and a global coupled ecosystem-circulation model, we find that the additional N and energy investments required for exoenzymatic breakdown of DOP give N2 fixers a competitive advantage in oligotrophic P-starved regions. Accounting for this mechanism expands the ecological niche of N2 fixers also to regions where the nutrient supply is high in N relative to R, yielding, in our model, a pattern consistent with the observed high N2 fixation rates in the oligotrophic North Atlantic.",

They are abundant through space and occur in packets of hundreds in the outer Van Allen radiation belts where they produce magnetic-field-aligned electron pitch angle distributions at energies up to a hundred keV. TDS can provide the seed electrons that are later accelerated to relativistic energies by whistlers and they also produce field-aligned electrons that may be responsible for some types of auroras. These field-aligned electron distributions result from at least three processes. The first process is parallel acceleration by Landau trapping in the TDS parallel electric field. The second process is Fermi acceleration due to reflection of electrons by the TDS. The third process is an effective and rapid pitch angle scattering resulting from electron interactions with the perpendicular and parallel electric and magnetic fields of many TDS. TDS are created by current-driven and beam-related instabilities and by whistler-related processes such as parametric decay of whistlers and nonlinear evolution from oblique whistlers.

A series of experiments on the lateral instability of monochromatic, deep water, unidirectional, initially long-crested steep waves was performed in a large wave basin. The cross modulation of wave crests is clearly visible; its magnitude depends on the wave steepness in the wave propagation direction. Its spatial scale is comparable with the wavelength. Thus, short crestedness is an inherent feature of nonlinear waves and should be taken into account when estimating directional properties of ocean waves.",

In this study, we used simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archives to investigate changes in the annual range of soil water storage under global warming at northern middle and high latitudes. Results show that future warming could lead to significant declines in snowfall, and a corresponding lack of snowmelt water recharge to the soil, which makes soil water less available during spring and summer. Conversely, more precipitation as rainfall results in higher recharge to soil water during its accumulating season. Thus, the wettest month of soil water gets wetter, and the driest month gets drier, resulting in an increase of the annual range and suggesting that stronger heterogeneity in global water distribution (changing extremes) could occur under global warming; this has implications for water management and water security under a changing climate.",

A better understanding of how solar radiation patterns affect the hydrologic response is needed to assess when calibrated temperature-index models are likely to be spatially transferable for ecohydrological applications. We induce different solar radiation patterns in a Swiss Alpine catchment through virtual rotations of the digital elevation model. Streamflow simulations are performed at different spatial scales through a spatially explicit hydrological model coupled to a physically based snow model. Results highlight that the effects of solar radiation patterns on the hydrologic response are scale dependent, i.e., significant at small scales with predominant aspects and weak at larger scales where aspects become uncorrelated and orientation differences average out. Such scale dependence proves relevant for the spatial transferability of a temperature-index model, whose calibrated degree-day factors are stable to different solar radiation patterns for catchment sizes larger than the aspect correlation scale.",

Model uncertainty in annual mean rainfall change is locally enhanced along the Gulf Stream. The moisture budget analysis reveals that much of the model uncertainty in rainfall change can be traced back to the discrepancies in surface evaporation change and transient eddy effect among models. Results of the intermodel Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis show that intermodel variations in local sea surface temperature (SST) pattern exert a strong control over the spread of rainfall projection among models through the modulation of evaporation change. The first three SVD modes explain more than 60% of the intermodel variance of rainfall projection and show distinct SST patterns with mode water-induced banded structures, reduced subpolar warming due to ocean dynamical cooling, and the Gulf Stream shift, respectively.",

For the twentieth century, reconstructions generally indicate a rate of GMSLR in the range of 1.5 to 2.0\u2009mm\u2009yr\u22121. However, the existence of nonlinear trends is still debated, and current estimates of the secular acceleration are subject to ample uncertainties. Here we use various GMSLR estimates published on scholarly journals since the 1940s for a heuristic assessment of global sea level acceleration. The approach, alternative to sea level reconstructions, is based on simple statistical methods and exploits the principles of meta-analysis. Our results point to a global sea level acceleration of 0.54 \u00b1 0.27\u2009mm/yr/century (1\u03c3) between 1898 and 1975. This supports independent estimates and suggests that a sea level acceleration since the early 1900s is more likely than currently believed.",

There, specific environmental conditions (steep slopes, snow- or ice-capped summit, dense vegetation cover, and strong tropospheric artifacts) and limited amount of radar data available make it challenging to accurately measure ground surface displacement with InSAR. To overcome these difficulties, we first performed a careful analysis of the water vapor variations using Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-infrared water vapor products and then we inverted wrapped interferograms for both topographic correlated phase delays and a simple model source strength. In the light of our results, we conclude that there is no detectable ground displacement related to a deep magmatic source for the 2003\u20132011 period and that most of the fringes observed in the interferograms were produced by tropospheric delays.",

Seismic tomography may be employed to map the accumulation of subsurface bubble-bearing fluids to help mitigating such hazards. Nevertheless, how gas bubbles modify seismic waves is still unclear. We show that saturated rocks strongly attenuate seismic waves when gas bubbles occupy part of the pore space. Laboratory measurements of elastic wave attenuation at frequencies <100\u2009Hz are modeled with a dynamic gas dissolution theory demonstrating that the observed frequency-dependent attenuation is caused by wave-induced-gas-exsolution-dissolution (WIGED). This result is incorporated into a numerical model simulating the propagation of seismic waves in a subsurface domain containing CO2-gas bubbles. This simulation shows that WIGED can significantly modify the wavefield and illustrates how accounting for this physical mechanism can potentially improve the monitoring and surveying of gas bubble-bearing fluids in the subsurface.",

Here the impact of tide gauge selection is explored by calculating global mean trends using three different tide gauge data sets that have been utilized in recent reconstruction studies. The inclusion of tide gauge records that are affected by unresolved internal variability and/or unaccounted for vertical land motion are found to significantly impact the estimates of the long-term trend in global mean sea level. In conclusion, several guidelines are presented regarding the selection of tide gauges for use in historical reconstructions focused on estimating the 20th century global mean sea level trend.",

We show that the radiation belt response is not random: The electron flux variations are determined by the combined effect of the structured solar wind driver and prestorm electron flux levels.

We find that non-Gaussian statistics of mirror modes lead to the parabolic collapse of kurtosis as the square of the skewness (K = aS2+B with a \u223c 1.3 and b \u223c\u2212 1). The parabolic scaling is a global constraint for the magnetosheath and is dictated by kinetic processes. This parabolic scaling is qualitatively independent of the distance to the magnetopause or bow shock, which implies that, even though the bow shock is driving the mirror mode instability, the dynamical evolution of mirror structures is independent of the source region and due to local processes. The parabolic relationship and coefficients between kurtosis and skewness for mirror modes in the Earth's magnetosheath are also similar to those found in a wide range of geophysical and laboratory turbulent environments, providing further evidence that turbulent systems dominated by non-Gaussian fluctuations hold universal statistical properties.",

Since a signal with a larger Hurst exponent is more regular and less erratic than a signal with a smaller one, the maps permit us to localize spatial structures characterized by different scaling properties.

The polar wind ion flux, estimated from electron outflow does not change with increasing net photoelectron production due to increasing solar activity. The magnitude of a self-created field-aligned potential drop is likely determined so as to equilibrate electron fluxes with ion fluxes regulated by a net production rate of H+ ions.

We present the first direct comparison of first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations with a quasi-linear diffusion code. In the PIC approach, the waves are self-consistently generated by the temperature anisotropy instability that quickly saturates and relaxes the system toward marginal stability. We show that the quasi-linear diffusion and PIC results have significant quantitative mismatch in regions of energy/pitch angle where the resonance condition is not satisfied. Moreover, for pitch angles close to the loss cone the diffusion code overestimates the scattering, particularly at low energies.

The net result is that the magnetic force accelerates the plasma at distances greater than approximately 14 RE, while it acts to decelerate it within that distance. The magnetic force, together with the thermal pressure gradient force, will determine the dynamics of the BBFs as they propagate toward the near-Earth tail region.

Its spatiotemporal distribution and generation mechanism are presently the object of active research. We here give the first report on the shock-induced disappearance of plasmaspheric hiss observed by the Van Allen Probes on 8 October 2013. This special event exhibits the dramatic variability of plasmaspheric hiss and provides a good opportunity to test its generation mechanisms. The origination of plasmaspheric hiss from plasmatrough chorus is suggested to be an appropriate prerequisite to explain this event. The shock increased the suprathermal electron fluxes, and then the enhanced Landau damping promptly prevented chorus waves from entering the plasmasphere. Subsequently, the shrinking magnetopause removed the source electrons for chorus, contributing significantly to the several-hours-long disappearance of plasmaspheric hiss.",

The hiss, made of whistler mode waves, exists for most of the time in the plasmasphere and is believed to control the radiation belt surrounding the Earth which makes its understanding very important. This paper presents direct observational evidence that the plasmaspheric hiss originates in the equatorial region of the plasmaspheric drainage plumes. It shows that the emissions propagate along the magnetic field lines and away from the equator in the plumes but toward the equator at lower L shells inside the plasmasphere.

We find that an oblique whistler wave with frequency at a fraction of the electron cyclotron frequency can resonate with electrons, leading to effective energy exchange between the wave and particles.",

The volatiles are liberated via surface energization processes associated with the harsh space environment, including solar wind plasma sputtering and impact vaporization. We find that some fraction of these volatiles can migrate from crater floors onto topside regions (those regions directly adjacent to and above the polar crater floors), and that these surrounding terrains should contain a sampling of the material originating within the crater itself. It is concluded that the nature of the volatile content on crater floors can be obtained by sampling the surface volatiles that have migrated or \u201cspilled out\u201d onto the adjacent terrain. This \u201cspillage\u201d effect could make human or robotic prospecting for crater resources significantly easier, since an assessment may not require direct entry into the very harsh polar crater environment. We also suggest that there are dynamic processes actively operating on the crater floors, and we estimate their source rates assuming dynamic equilibrium of the observed water frost and our modeled loss rates.",

Direct evidence of oceanic salts on Europa's surface has been largely inconclusive. We show that the observed color within geologically young features on Europa's surface can be explained by sodium chloride delivered from the ocean below. We find that sodium chloride, when exposed to Europa surface conditions, accumulates electrons in F and M centers, yielding a yellow-brown discoloration comparable to Europa's surface. Irradiation of sodium chloride from Europa's ocean thus provides a simple and elegant solution to the color of the non-ice material observed on Europa. This evidence for endogenous salts suggests that Europa's ocean is interacting with a silicate seafloor, a critical consideration for assessing habitability.",

The experiments involved a cylindrical sample of Westerly granite being deformed under various triaxial stress states and fractured with distilled water, which was injected at a range of constant rates. Acoustic emission sensors were absolutely calibrated, and the radiated seismic energy was estimated. The seismic energy was found to range from 7.02E\u22128% to 1.24E\u22124% of the injection energy which is consistent with a range of values for induced seismicity from field-scale hydraulic fracture operations. The deformation energy (crack opening) of the sample during hydraulic fracture propagation was measured using displacement sensors and ranged from 18% to 94% of the injection energy.

Here, we explore a seafloor spreading-aligned reference frame. We show that this reference frame fits azimuthal seismic anisotropy in the uppermost mantle very well. The corresponding Euler pole is close to those of hot spot reference frames, ridge motion minimizing models, and geodynamic estimates of net rotation and predicts clear trench motion patterns. We conclude that a net rotation pole guided by the spreading-aligned model (at 64\u00b0E, 61\u00b0S, with moderate rotation of \u223c 0.2 \u2026 0.3\u00b0/Myr) could indeed represent a standard, comprehensive reference frame for present-day plate motions with respect to the deep mantle.",

We present synchronous seismic and hydromechanical measurements directly recorded in the decametric injection zone. The three main types of seismic events were recorded during injection and shut-in: high-amplitude and short duration seismic events (SE) (i.e., microearthquakes), low to constant amplitude and 5 to 17\u2009s long tremor-like signals (TLS), and long period events (LP) with a narrow-frequency band content. Seismicity first initiates with a sequence of SE and TLS, when pressure is high (~3.5\u2009MPa), slip is activated on the fault, which experiences a twentyfold increase of permeability. Then LP events appear to be associated to fluid leakage in the fault caused by dilation during slip. During shut-in, residual pressures as low as 0.6 MPa still trigger SE events. We show that the initial TLS sequence triggers when a progressive transition occurs from rupture controlled by effective stress variations close to the injection source to a large friction weakening-dominated slip on the fault. We conclude that the combination of these different seismic signal types may be a proxy to monitor fault instability associated to fluid pressure perturbations.",

The friction coefficient decreased to ~0.1 during sliding, and the slip surface temperature reached 300\u00b0C by 6\u2009m of slip displacement. The slip caused a small, but distinct decrease of Li in the deformed gouge when the slip surface temperature exceeded 300\u00b0C.

VLFEs are rich in low-frequency energy (20\u201350\u2009s) and depleted in higher frequencies (higher than 1\u2009Hz) compared to local earthquakes. Based on a grid search centroid moment tensor inversion, we find that VLFEs are located near the plate interface in the zone where tremor and slow slip are observed. In addition, they migrate along strike with tremor activity. Their moment tensor solutions show double-couple sources with shallow thrust mechanisms, consistent with shear slip at the plate interface. Their magnitude ranges between Mw 3.3 and 3.7. Seismic moment released by a single VLFE is comparable to the total cumulative moment released by tremor activity during an entire episodic tremor and slip event. The VLFEs contribute more seismic moment to this episodic tremor and slip event than cumulative tremor activity and indicate a higher seismic efficiency of slow earthquakes in Cascadia than previously thought. Spatiotemporal correlation of VLFE and tremor activity suggests that they are the results of the same physical processes governing slow earthquakes.",

This result encourages using M2 satellite magnetic data to constrain subsurface electrical conductivity in oceanic regions. Traditional satellite-based induction studies using signals of magnetospheric origin are mostly sensitive to conducting structures because of the inductive coupling between primary and induced sources. In contrast, galvanic coupling from the oceanic tidal signal allows for studying less conductive, shallower structures. We perform global 3-D electromagnetic numerical simulations to investigate the sensitivity of M2 signals to conductivity distributions at different depths. The results of our sensitivity analysis suggest it will be promising to use M2 oceanic signals detected at satellite altitude for probing lithospheric and upper mantle conductivity. Our simulations also suggest that M2 seafloor electric and magnetic field data may provide complementary details to better constrain lithospheric conductivity.",

The listric strike-slip Wairarapa Fault and other splay faults that sole into the BSZ imply long-term weakness. High rates of intraslab seismicity with low rates above the slab imply stress decoupling across the BSZ. Association of high fluid pressures and long-term weakness with geodetic locking is in contrast to similar observations at zones of slow slip at the northern Hikurangi margin and suggest that either (1) pore fluid pressure or locking behavior may cycle over times longer than two decades or (2) local material properties play a significant role in determining if slow slip or locking occurs.",

Tectonic tremors in Taiwan have been discovered at ~30\u2009km depth beneath the southern Central Range, which is a young and active collisional mountain belt. Here we provide the first evidence for the focal mechanism of tremor using moment tensor inversion in the very low frequency band, employing broadband seismograms stacked relative to the hypocentral time of tremor. The best solution corresponds to low-angle thrust faulting, suggesting the subduction of the Eurasian plate. This mechanism is consistent with strong tidal modulation of tremor activity but differs from the normal-type faulting that dominates regional shallow earthquakes. This result suggests vertical variations in the tectonic stress regime. Thrust faulting may be facilitated by a decrease in normal stress due to the buoyant roots of the mountain belt and local high fluid pressure.",

The hypocenters of 799 relocated earthquakes suggest that two independent main shock-aftershock subsequences occurred on the Selaha and Zheduotang branches of the Xianshuihe fault, respectively. Fault slip inversion results from one interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) interferogram (26 September 2014 to 5 December 2014) show that the Mw 5.9 main shock produced a maximum slip of ~0.47\u2009m at the depth of ~9\u2009km. However, there is no distinct slip associated with the Mw 5.6 main shock. The InSAR determined moment is 2.36\u2009\u00d7\u20091018\u2009Nm with a rigidity of 30\u2009GPa, equivalent to Mw 6.2, which is about twofold the total seismic moment of all the recorded earthquakes during the InSAR time span. This large discrepancy between geodetic and seismic moment estimates indicates that there was probably rapid aseismic afterslip in the 2 weeks following the Mw 5.9 main shock. The released seismic energy of this earthquake sequence is far less than the accumulated strain energy since the 1955 M 712 earthquake on the same fault branch, which implies that the seismic risk on the Selaha-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault remains high.",

As the initial data, we use high-resolution gravity field, topography, and recent models of sedimentary basins. The western part of the plate is generally characterized by low to midvalues of EET (10\u201330\u2009km) while the eastern one by high values (50\u2009km and more in the core). This finding confirms that the pronounced asymmetry of the plate is rather associated with fundamental structural differences of the lithosphere than with a forced tilt of the plate due to the rifting in the west-southwest and subduction in the northeast. Therefore, the high topography in the western part of the plate is likely supported by relatively hot mantle that is also responsible for the decrease of EET. These results are generally in agreement with recent seismic tomography models.",

Modeling indicates that the coseismic surface deformation was caused by ~9\u2009cm of strike-slip displacement along a shallow subvertical fault. The earthquake was followed by at least 1\u2009year of afterslip, releasing ~70% of the moment of the main event, equivalent to a M5.4 earthquake. This high aseismic relative to the seismic moment release is consistent with previous observations for moderate earthquakes (M\u2009<\u20096) and suggests that smaller earthquakes are associated with a higher aseismic relative to seismic moment release than larger earthquakes.",

During the winter of 2013\u20132014, the lakes endured the most persistent, lowest temperatures and highest ice cover in recent history, fostering speculation that over-lake evaporation rates might decrease and that water levels might rise. To address this speculation, we examined interseasonal relationships in Lake Michigan's thermal regime. We find pronounced relationships between winter conditions and subsequent fall heat content, modest relationships with fall surface temperature, but essentially no correlation with fall evaporation rates. Our findings suggest that the extreme winter conditions of 2013\u20132014 may have induced a shift in Lake Michigan's thermal regime and that this shift coincides with a recent (and ongoing) rise in Great Lakes water levels. If the shift persists, it could (assuming precipitation rates remain relatively constant) represent a return to thermal and hydrologic conditions not observed on Lake Michigan in over 15\u2009years.",

However, observations from peat soils suggest that ebullition and environmental forcing may not always be correlated and that interactions between bubbles and the peat structure may be the cause of such decoupling. To investigate this possibility, we used a simple computer model (Model of Ebullition and Gas storAge) to simulate methane ebullition from a model peat. We found that lower porosity peat can store methane bubbles for lengthy periods of time, effectively buffering or moderating ebullition so that it no longer reflects bubble production signals.

We used stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to estimate contributions of snow and rainfall to 80 boreal streams and show that differences in snow contribution are controlled by watershed topography. Time series analysis of stream thermal regimes revealed that streams in rain-dominated, low-elevation watersheds were 5\u20138 times more sensitive to variation in summer air temperature compared to streams draining steeper topography whose flows were dominated by snowmelt. This effect was more pronounced across the landscape in early summer and less distinct in late summer. Thus, the impact of climate warming on freshwater thermal regimes will be spatially heterogeneous across river basins as controlled by geomorphic features. However, thermal heterogeneity may be lost with reduced snowpack and increased ratios of rain to snow in stream discharge.",

To monitor essential snowpack properties, we installed an upward looking ground-penetrating radar (upGPR) and a low-cost GPS system below the snow cover and observed in parallel its evolution during two winter seasons. Applying external snow height (HS) information, both systems provided consistent LWC estimates in snow, based on independent approaches, namely measurements of travel time and attenuation of electromagnetic waves. By combining upGPR and GPS, we now obtain a self-contained approach instead of having to rely on external information such as HS.

We use published ice deformation data and a simple one-dimensional thermal model to show that West Antarctic ice stream margins have temperate ice over a substantial fraction of their thickness, a condition that may control their width. The model predicts a triple-valued relation between the thickness-averaged lateral shear stress and the lateral shear strain rate. Observed strain rates at the margins imply that they support slightly less lateral shear stress than adjacent ice within the stream. This requires enhanced basal resistance near the margin. We suggest, in agreement with the limited observations, the presence of a channelized drainage system at the margin that reduces the pore fluid pressure at the ice-till interface, thus increasing the shear stress acting on the yielding Coulomb plastic bed.",

These data sampled a baroclinic, middepth eddy formed during the disintegration of a deep boundary current. Turbulent dissipation is suppressed within the eddy but is elevated by up to an order of magnitude along the upper and lower eddy boundaries. A ray tracing approximation is employed as a heuristic device to elucidate how the internal wave field evolves in the ambient velocity and stratification conditions accompanying the eddy. These calculations are consistent with the observations, suggesting reflection of internal wave energy from the eddy center and enhanced breaking through critical layer processes along the eddy boundaries. These results have important implications for understanding where and how internal wave energy is dissipated in the presence of energetic deep geostrophic flows.",

These arrays are necessarily limited to individual latitudes. A potential proxy for the MOC covering longer time scales and larger spatial scales is desirable. Here we use sea surface height data from satellites to estimate the interannual variability of transbasin ocean transports at 26\u00b0N. Combining this estimate with surface Ekman transport and cable measurements of the Florida Current, we construct a time series of the MOC from 1993 to 2014. This satellite-based estimate recovers over 90% of the interannual variability of the MOC measured by the RAPID 26\u00b0N array. This analysis complements in situ observational efforts to measure the MOC at multiple latitudes and opens the door to a broader spatial understanding of the Atlantic circulation variability.",

Our multidisciplinary study reveals ~60\u2009m of suspended sediment inside a pockmark. The sediment suspension is 2.6\u00b0 warmer and isotopically lighter in \u03b418OH2O by 1.5\u2030 than the ambient lake water, documenting currently active fluid flow by karstic groundwater discharge from the Jura Mountain front into the Swiss Plateau hydrological system.

Frequency spectra of internal wave horizontal kinetic energy in the North Pacific lie closer to observations in the 0.04\u00b0 simulation than in the 0.08\u00b0 simulation. The horizontal wave number and frequency (K-\u03c9) kinetic energy spectra contain peaks in the semidiurnal tidal band and near-inertial band, along with a broadband frequency continuum aligned along the linear dispersion relations of low-vertical-mode internal waves. Spectral kinetic energy transfers describe the rate at which nonlinear mechanisms remove or supply kinetic energy in specific K-\u03c9 ranges.

The simplest technique has known limitations and assumes that a spatial climate anomaly pattern obtained from a GCM can be scaled by the global mean temperature (GMT) anomaly. We propose alternatives and assess their skills and limitations. One approach which avoids scaling is to consider a period in a different scenario with the same GMT change. It is attractive as it provides patterns of any temporal resolution that are consistent across variables, and it does not distort variability. Second, we extend the traditional approach with a land-sea contrast term, which provides the largest improvements over the traditional technique. When interpolating between known bounding scenarios, the proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy of the pattern scaled scenario with little computational cost. The remaining errors are much smaller than the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 model spread.",

CMIP5 models can simulate the ENSO-monsoon spatial structure reasonably well when using the multimodel mean. Running correlations show prominent decadal variability of the ENSO-monsoon relationship in observations. The modeled ENSO-monsoon relation shows large intermodel spread, indicating large variations across the model ensemble. The anthropogenically forced component of ENSO-monsoon relationship is separated from the naturally varying component based on a signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function analysis using global sea surface temperature (SST). Results show that natural variability plays a dominant role in the varied ENSO-monsoon relationship during the 20th century.

Objective measures of interannual variability (IAV) yields nearly equal chance for future increase or decrease. This leads to discrepancy in quantifying changes in ISMR and variability. However, based primarily on the physical association between mean changes in ISMR and its IAV, and objective methods such as k-means clustering with Dunn's validity index, mean seasonal cycle, and reliability ensemble averaging, projections fall into distinct groups. Physically consistent groups of models with the highest reliability project future reduction in the frequency of light rainfall but increase in high to extreme rainfall and thereby future increase in ISMR by 0.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009mm\u2009d\u22121, along with increased future IAV.

Areas in the Amazon, the Sahel, tropical West Africa, Indonesia, and central eastern Asia emerge as primary observed hotspots. The main contributing factors are the global increase in mean temperatures, the intensification of extreme hot-season occurrence in low-latitude regions and the decrease of precipitation over central Africa. Temperature and precipitation variability have been substantially stable over the past decades, with only a few areas showing significant changes against the background climate variability. The regions identified from the observations are remarkably similar to those defined from projections of global climate models under a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario, indicating that climate change hotspots are robust and persistent over time.

Multidecadal changes in the ocean mean state are hence likely to modulate ENSO properties. To better link background state variations with low-frequency amplitude changes of ENSO, we develop a diagnostic framework that determines locally the contributions of different physical feedback terms on the ocean surface temperature variance. Our analysis shows that multidecadal changes of ENSO variance originate from the delicate balance between the background-state-dependent positive thermocline feedback and the atmospheric damping of sea surface temperatures anomalies. The role of higher-order processes and atmospheric and oceanic nonlinearities is also discussed. The diagnostic tool developed here can be easily applied to other tropical ocean areas and climate phenomena.",

While the warm phase of ENSO promotes drier and warmer than normal conditions across the region during winter and spring that favor widespread fire activity the following summer, a reduction in VLFs was found during the warm phase of ENSO during summer concurrent with the fire season. This paradox is primarily tied to an anomalous upper level trough over the western U.S. and positive anomalies in integrated water vapor that extend over the northwestern U.S. during summers when the warm phase of ENSO is present.

        "description": "\nThe warm phase of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation can grow much stronger than the cold phase, but the associated dynamics are not well understood. Here we show that the anomalous zonal advection of warm water is the major process that pushes El Ni\u00f1o to extremes and that this anomalous advection results from the coupling of oceanic currents with eastward migration of the atmospheric convection; a greater zonal advection is associated with a greater extent of the eastward migration. By contrast, there is a limited extent for westward migration during La Ni\u00f1a. Climate models that successfully simulate the amplitude asymmetry display a systematic linkage of a greater longitudinal movement of the convection center with a stronger zonal advection and greater El Ni\u00f1o amplitude. In a warming world, the longitudinal migration of convection response increases, as does the role of zonal advection, increasing the frequency of future extremes of El Ni\u00f1o.",

        "description": "\n\nBy grouping the contiguous precipitating area detected by the precipitation radar on board the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) core satellite, snapshots of precipitation systems are summarized as precipitation features (PFs), and their properties are cataloged from 1\u2009year GPM observations. These PFs are categorized by their area and depth and convective intensity based on the 20 and 40\u2009dBZ radar echo tops, respectively. The largest PFs are found mainly over ocean at the mid-high latitudes, especially over southern ocean. The deepest PFs are mainly over tropical land, the West Pacific Warm Pool, and the Great Plains of the United States and Argentina. The most convectively intense PFs are dominant over land regions, including midlatitude and high latitude. The zonal precipitation contribution from extremely large precipitation systems is greater in midlatitude and high latitude than in the tropics. These extreme precipitation systems are rare but contribute significantly to the global precipitation. It is important to include their impacts in global climate models to correctly describe the global water cycle.",

        "description": "\n\nAnemophilous (wind-dispersed) pollen grains are emitted in large quantities by vegetation in the midlatitudes for reproduction. Pollen grains are coarse particles (5\u2013150\u2009\u00b5m) that can rupture when wet to form submicron subpollen particles (SPP) that may have a climatic role. Laboratory CCN experiments of six fresh pollen samples show that SPP activate as CCN at a range of sizes, requiring supersaturations from 0.81 (\u00b1\u20090.07)% for 50 nm particles, 0.26 (\u00b1\u20090.03)% for 100\u2009nm particles, and 0.12 (\u00b1\u20090.00)% for 200\u2009nm particles. Compositional analyses indicate that SPP contain carbohydrates and proteins. The SPP contribution to global CCN is uncertain but could be important depending on pollen concentrations outside the surface layer and the number of SPP generated from a single pollen grain. The production of hygroscopic SPP from pollen represents a novel, biologically driven cloud formation pathway that may influence cloud optical properties and lifetimes, thereby influencing climate.",

        "description": "\nThis paper examines the impact of the dynamical core on the simulation of tropical cyclone (TC) frequency, distribution, and intensity. The dynamical core, the central fluid flow component of any general circulation model (GCM), is often overlooked in the analysis of a model's ability to simulate TCs compared to the impact of more commonly documented components (e.g., physical parameterizations). The Community Atmosphere Model version 5 is configured with multiple dynamics packages. This analysis demonstrates that the dynamical core has a significant impact on storm intensity and frequency, even in the presence of similar large-scale environments. In particular, the spectral element core produces stronger TCs and more hurricanes than the finite-volume core using very similar parameterization packages despite the latter having a slightly more favorable TC environment. The results suggest that more detailed investigations into the impact of the GCM dynamical core on TC climatology are needed to fully understand these uncertainties.",

        "description": "\nWe couple airborne, ground-based, and satellite observations; conduct regional simulations; and develop and apply an inversion technique to constrain hourly smoke emissions from the Rim Fire, the third largest observed in California, USA. Emissions constrained with multiplatform data show notable nocturnal enhancements (sometimes over a factor of 20), correlate better with daily burned area data, and are a factor of 2\u20134 higher than a priori estimates, highlighting the need for improved characterization of diurnal profiles and day-to-day variability when modeling extreme fires. Constraining only with satellite data results in smaller enhancements mainly due to missing retrievals near the emissions source, suggesting that top-down emission estimates for these events could be underestimated and a multiplatform approach is required to resolve them. Predictions driven by emissions constrained with multiplatform data present significant variations in downwind air quality and in aerosol feedback on meteorology, emphasizing the need for improved emissions estimates during exceptional events.",

        "description": "\n\nMeasurements of the diurnal cycle of potassium (K) atoms between 80 and 110\u2009km have been made during October (for the years 2004\u20132011) using a Doppler lidar at K\u00fchlungsborn, Germany (54.1\u00b0N, 11.7\u00b0E). A pronounced diurnal variation is observed in the K number density, which is explored by using a detailed description of the neutral and ionized chemistry of K in a three-dimensional chemistry climate model. The model captures both the amplitude and phase of the diurnal and semidiurnal variability of the layer, although the peak diurnal amplitude around 90\u2009km is overestimated. The model shows that the total potassium density (\u2248\u2009K\u2009+\u2009K+\u2009+\u2009KHCO3) exhibits little diurnal variation at each altitude, and the diurnal variations are largely driven by photochemical conversion between these reservoir species. In contrast, tidally driven vertical transport has a small effect at this midlatitude location, and diurnal fluctuations in temperature are of little significance because they are small and the chemistry of K is relatively temperature independent.",
