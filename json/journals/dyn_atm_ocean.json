Model performance has been evaluated in terms of variables of interest for oceanographic applications, such as sea surface temperature (SST), surface heat fluxes, solar radiation and near surface meteorological parameters (air temperature, wind, pressure and humidity). The validation has been undertaken through a comparison against surface data (buoys and oceanographic platforms) available at different locations in the northern Adriatic area, while advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) products have been used to assess modeled wind fields on a larger scale.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0095\" view=\"all\">Model results indicate a good agreement with the observations concerning meteorological variables, in particular wind, pressure and temperature.

Furthermore, due to high sensitivity of the simulations to the cloud radiation feedback, the tropical convection remains a major source of uncertainty in long-term weather and climate forecasts. In a series of recent studies, it has been shown, in paradigm two-baroclinic-mode systems and in aquaplanet GCMs, that a stochastic multicloud convective parameterization based on three cloud types (congestus, deep and stratiform) can be used to improve the variability and the dynamical structure of tropical convection, including intermittent coherent structures such as synoptic and mesoscale convective systems. Here, the stochastic multicloud model is modified with a parameterized cloud radiation feedback mechanism and atmosphere-ocean coupling. The radiative convective feedback mechanism is shown to increase the mean and variability of the Walker circulation. The corresponding intensification of the circulation is associated with propagating synoptic scale systems originating inside of the enhanced sea surface temperature area. In column simulations, the atmosphere ocean coupling introduces pronounced low frequency convective features on the time scale associated with the depth of the mixed ocean layer. However, in the presence of the gravity wave mixing of spatially extended simulations, these features are not as prominent. This highlights the deficiency of the column model approach at predicting the behavior of multiscale spatially extended systems. Overall, the study develops a systematic framework for incorporating parameterized radiative cloud feedback and ocean coupling which may be used to improve representation of intraseasonal and seasonal variability in GCMs.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Numerical simulations are forced by the output of regional climate simulations with RegCM3, which uses IPCC\u2019s historical data on greenhouse gasses emissions for the (past) period 1951\u20132000, and IPCC\u2019s A1B climate scenario for the (future) period 2001\u20132100. Comparisons between observations and modeling results show good agreement and confirm the ability of our model to estimate the response of the sea surface to future climatic conditions. We investigate the future trends, the variability and frequency of local extremes and the main forcing mechanisms that can induce strong surges in the Mediterranean region. Our results support that there is a general decreasing trend in storminess under the considered climate scenario, mostly related to the frequency of local peaks and the duration and spatial coverage of the storm surges. The northward shift in the location of storm tracks is a possible reason for this storminess attenuation, especially over areas where the main driving factor of extreme events is the inverted barometer effect. However, the magnitudes of sea surface elevation extremes may increase in several Mediterranean sub-regions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, Southern Adriatic, Balearic and Tyrrhenian Seas, during the 21st century. There are clear distinctions in the contributions of winds and pressure fields to the sea level height for various regions of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as on the seasonal variability of extreme values; the Aegean and Adriatic Seas are characteristic examples, where high surges are predicted to be mainly induced by low pressure systems and favorable winds, respectively.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this quadrangle, an area weighted pressure gradient (AWPG) was computed for the whole area and for the north\u2013south and west\u2013east halves.

The scale of instability is found to increase and tend to skew towards the upper edge of the downflow as the ensuing instability switches from the upper branch to the lower one. Our findings surprisingly resonate with previously reported observations. Critical Reynolds number, below which the flow is stable to infinitesimal disturbances, is found to increase as the slope angle decreases. The role played by the bottom slope is essentially twofold. On one hand, the downslope component of gravity acts as the driving force for downflows. On the other hand, the wall-normal component of gravity acts for the stratification effect. Therefore, as the slope angle decreases, the driving force diminishes and the stratification intensifies, which can explain that the critical Reynolds number increases as the slope angle decreases. When a downflow propagates onto a sufficiently low slope angle, the low driving force and intensified stratification effect would make the downflow less prone to sustain a turbulent state of flow, which ultimately leads to the final stage of a gravity current event.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0377026515000317-fx1.jpg\" height=\"174\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/> <h3 class=\"h3\">Highlights</h3> <simple-para xmlns:ns2=\"http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4\" xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" id=\"spar0005\" view=\"all\"> <display> <figure id=\"fig0035\"> <link locator=\"fx1\"/> </figure> </display> </simple-para></br></br><br></br></br>",

Results indicate that the net heat flux is responsible for the appearance and extinction of the SWTAWP. From March to May, the SWTAWP attains its maximum development and sometimes merges with equatorial warm waters towards the African continent, whose development follows the same period. Along the equator, the combination of oceanic terms (i.e., advection and diffusion) is important to promote the separation - when it occurs - of equatorial warm waters from southwestern tropical waters, which develops off the Brazilian coast. An analysis of the relative contribution of the temperature tendency terms of the mixed layer (ML) heat budget over the appearance, development and extinction of the SWTAWP is also done. The most important term for warming and cooling inside of the ML is the net heat flux at the sea surface. The ML is heated by the atmosphere between October and April, whereas the upper ocean cools down between May and September. The highest heat content values occur during the lower-temperature period (August to October), which is linked to the deepening of the ML during this time period. The horizontal advection along the equator is important, particularly at the eastern domain, which is influenced by the cold tongue. In this area, the vertical diffusive term is also significant; however, it presents values near zero outside the equator. These results contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of the heat budget within the tropical Atlantic, as previous studies over this region focused along the equator only.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Despite an established long-term surface warming trend for the whole northern hemisphere, sea surface temperatures (SST) in the East Pacific have remained relatively constant for the period of 2001\u20132010. Our analysis reveals that SST anomaly probability density function of the leading two Isomap components is bimodal. We conclude that Isomap shows the existence of two distinct regimes in surface ocean temperature, resembling the break and active phases of rainfall over equatorial land areas. These regimes occurred within two separated time windows during the past three decades. Strengthening of trade winds over Pacific was coincident with the cold phase of east equatorial Pacific. This pattern was reversed during the warm phase of east equatorial Pacific. The El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997/1998 happened within the transition mode between these two regimes and may be a trigger for the SST changes in the Pacific. Furthermore, we suggest that Isomap, compared with MCA, provides more information about the behavior and predictability of the inter-seasonal atmosphere\u2013ocean interactions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A significant positive correlation (at a 99% confidence level) was found between the summer precipitation anomaly and the intensity of the QBW and ISO modes in the region. By examining the composite structure and evolution characteristics, we note that the QBW mode is characterized by a northwest\u2013southeast oriented wave train pattern, moving southeastward. The perturbations associated with the ISO mode propagate northwestward in strong ISO years but southeastward in weak ISO years. A marked feature is the phase leading of low-level moisture to convection in both the QBW and ISO mode. When the summer rainfall is strong in the ChangJiang Valley, large-scale atmospheric conditions in the strong QBW/ISO activity region are characterized by deeper moist layer, convectively more unstable stratification and greater ascending motion. Such mean conditions favor the growth of the QBW and ISO perturbations. Thus, a significant positive correlation between the summer precipitation and the strength of sub-seasonal variability arises from the large-scale control of the summer mean flow to perturbations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Calculations confirm the classical equilibrium condition by Gibbs that an isothermal temperature profile gives a maximum in entropy constrained by a constant mass and a constant sum of internal and potential energy. However, it was also found that an isentropic profile gives a maximum in entropy constrained by a constant mass and a constant internal energy of the fluid column. On the basis of this result a hypothesis is suggested that the adiabatic lapse rate represents a restricted or transitory and metastable equilibrium state, which has a maximum in entropy with lower value than the maximum in the state with an isothermal lapse rate.

SHRL variations from 1990 to 2011 are subdivided into three categories, while parameter differences relating to three differing models are examined. Dynamical characteristics of SHRL are analyzed and an aberrance mechanism subsequently developed. Modeling suggests that different parameters may lead to significant variance pertaining to monsoon variables corresponding with numerous WPSH activities.

Seasonal distribution of mineral dust around the globe and its correlation with atmospheric circulation is investigated using satellite data, and meteorological data from ECMWF. The most important sources of dust are located in North Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia with an observed summer maximum, and East Asia with a spring peak. Maximum dust activity over North Africa and the Middle East in summer is attributed to dry convection associated with the summertime low-pressure system, while unstable weather and dry conditions are responsible for the spring peak in dust emission in East Asia. Intercontinental transport of mineral dust by atmospheric circulation has been observed, including trans-Atlantic transport of North African dust, trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust, and transport of dust from the Middle East across the Indian Ocean. The extent of African dust over the Atlantic Ocean and its latitudinal variation with season is related to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, including seasonal changes in the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and variation of wind patterns. North African aerosols extend over longer distances across the North Atlantic in summer because of greater dust emission, an intensified easterly low level jet (LLJ) and strengthening of the Azores-Bermuda anticyclonic circulation. Transport of East Asian aerosol is facilitated by the existence of a LLJ that extends from East Asia to the west coast of North America.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Northward migrations of the equatorial currents in the Atlantic Ocean have little influence on the Gulf Stream. Nevertheless, southward migrations, especially abrupt large southward migrations of the equatorial currents, can lead to the increase of the Brazil Current and the significant decrease of the North Brazil Current, in turn the weakening of the Gulf Stream.

Outside the frontal zones the coupling only redistributes the surface temperature perturbation but does not change the total pseudo-momentum and pseudo-energy.

The stability conditions, more general than the ones obtained by <cross-ref id=\"crf0020\" refid=\"bib0165\">Spall (2007)</cross-ref>, are obtained from the conservation of the wave-activities. Inside the SST frontal zones, however, the coupling, along with the nonlinear Ekman effect, destroys the conservation of the SG pseudo-momentum and pseudo-energy. Therefore no stability condition is available, indicating that the current inside the frontal zone may be unstabilized by the coupling or nonlinear Ekman transport effect. It is also found that different dynamical features inside and outside frontal zones cause the different modulation of the coupling strength.

The derivative properties of VST in conjunction with the NMS's newly designed dynamically constrained core are capable of accurately capturing the deformations of flows by any type of terrain variability. Numerical differencing schemes needed to satisfy critical integral constraints, while also effectively enabling the VST lower boundary, are described. The host model constraints include mass, momentum, energy, vorticity and enstrophy conservation. A quasi-compressible closure cast on multiple-nest rotated spherical grids is the underlying framework used to study the advantages of the VST coordinate system. The principle objective behind the VST formulation is to combine the advantages of both terrain-following and step coordinate systems without suffering either of their disadvantages, while at the same time creating a vertical surface coordinate setting suitable for a scalable, nonhydrostatic model, safeguarded with physically realistic dynamical constraints.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

When displayed as a function of <italic>z</italic>, the displacements <italic>d</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) reveal a characteristic zigzag shape. Here, we primarily investigate the particular slope (<italic>z</italic>/<italic>d</italic>) of this zigzag signature after assigning the displacements to the end-point depths. Using model-overturns we show that this slope equals \u00bd for a solid-body-rotation, while a more sophisticated Rankine-vortex overturn-model, here employed in the vertical, has slopes slightly &amp;gt;\u00bd in the interior and &amp;gt;1 along the sides. In the case of a near-homogeneous layer, displacement-points fill a parallelogram with side-edges having a slope of 1. The models are used to interpret overturn shapes in NE-Atlantic-Ocean-data from moderately deep, turbulent waters above Rockall Bank (off Ireland) and from deep, weakly stratified waters above Mount Josephine (off Portugal). These are compared with salinity-compensated intrusion data in Mediterranean-outflow-waters in the Canary Basin. Dynamically, most overturns are found to resemble the half-turn Rankine-vortex model and very few a, small-only, solid-body-rotation.

Depending on the initial position of the observed tracers, the model studied here can exhibit nonlinear features that cause the standard Kalman filter and its variants to fail. For this reason, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach known as particle filtering, which takes the nonlinear dynamics into account. The main objective of this paper is to understand the effects of drifter placement and layer coupling on the precision skill of assimilating Lagrangian data into multi-layered models. Therefore, we analyze the quality of the assimilated vortex estimates by assimilating path data from passive tracers launched at different locations, on different layers and in systems with various coupling strengths between layers. We consider two cases: vortices placed on different layers (heton) and on the same layer (non-heton). In both cases we find that launch location, launch layer and coupling strength all play a significant role in assimilation precision skill. However, the specifics of the interplay of these three factors are quite different for the heton case versus the non-heton case.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Zonal averages for all variables were computed in 5-degree latitude bands. Unlike other regions of the Arctic Ocean, the marginal ice zone in the Greenland Sea is confined to north of 75\u00b0 N. The CHL time series is characterized by high interannual variability, especially in the northern marginal sea ice zone (MIZ) where variability in sea ice extent is a likely factor. The ten-year climatology shows that CHL increases from March, reaching a seasonal peak in May in the southern sector and in June in the northern sectors. The climatological peak of AOD is achieved in April in all latitude bands, about a month before the peak in CHL. This suggests that the Arctic aerosol burden is strongly affected by continental sources in early spring.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0015\" view=\"all\">Interestingly, a summer increase in AOD (which succeeds the CHL maximum) is seen in some years.

There is considerable interannual variability in both the onset of melt and the extent of sea ice loss during summer, with the minimum summer sea ice extent decreasing to almost zero in five of the years. Cross-correlation analyses of the three times series identify a statistically significant relation between CHL and AOD in six of the years in the southern sector, but no correlation between CHL and ICE was found in the northern sector. There is, however, a significant correlation between AOD and ICE time series in the northern sector in four years. High AOD values registered in early spring are most likely of anthropogenic origin, however, peaks later in summer coincident with the phytoplankton bloom and high emissions of biogenic aerosol precursors such as dimethylsulfide and other primary aerosols of marine origin, suggest the summer atmospheric aerosol burden is likely influenced by biogenic emissions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The phenomenon of focus is the nonlinear generation of harmonics. A total of 24 simulations have been performed, varying the normalized pycnocline thickness and the ratio of peak pycnocline Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency to that of the stratified lower layer. Harmonics at the point of IWB entry into the pycnocline increase in amplitude and number with a measure of the maximum gradient of the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, suggesting refraction as an important factor in harmonic generation. Among the simulations performed, two distinct limits of pycnocline thickness are identified. For thin pynoclines, whose thickness is 10% of the incident IWB's horizontal wavelength, harmonics trapped within the pycnocline have maximum amplitude when their frequency and wavenumber match those of the natural pycnocline interfacial wave mode. Results in this case are compared with weakly nonlinear theory for harmonic generation by plane wave refraction. For thicker pycnoclines, whose thickness is equal the incident IWB's horizontal wavelength, IWB refraction results in harmonic generation at multiple locations in addition to pycnocline entry, giving rise to complex flow structure inside the pycnocline.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A 1250-m opening in the causeway near the east coast links the two lakes. The differences in mean water levels and densities of the two lakes increase in spring due to large freshwater inflows into the south lake. High evaporation dominates the lake in summer. By incorporating the results of a two-layer hydraulics theory into a mixing model of the lake, we show that the exchange flow through the opening diminishes the water level and salinity differences of the two lakes and hence helps restoration of the pre-construction state of the lake by the end of fall. The model results are confirmed by the field data.

Key properties of the LC are its poleward strengthening, deepening to the south, and shelfbreak intensification. The alongshore flow reverses direction below about 300<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m, forming the LUC at greater depths. To investigate the processes that cause these features, we obtain solutions to an idealized, regional ocean model of the South Indian Ocean. Solutions are forced by relaxing surface density to a prescribed, meridionally varying density profile <italic>\u03c1</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">*</sup>(<italic>y</italic>) with a timescale of <italic>\u03b4t</italic>. In addition, vertical diffusion is intensified near the ocean surface. This diffusion establishes the minimum thickness over which density is well-mixed. We define this thickness as the \u201cupper layer\u201d. Solutions are obtained with and without a continental shelf and slope off Western Australia and for a range of values of <italic>\u03b4t</italic> and mixing parameters. Within this upper layer, there is a meridional density gradient that balances a near-surface, eastward geostrophic flow. The eastward current downwells near the eastern boundary, leading to westward flow at depth. The upper layer's meridional structure and zonal currents crucially depend on coastal processes, including the presence of topography near the eastern boundary. Kelvin waves inhibit the upper layer from deepening at the coast. Rossby waves propagate the coastal density structure offshore, hence modifying the interior currents. A comparison of the solutions with or without a continental shelf and slope demonstrate that topographic trapping of Rossby waves is a necessary process for maintaining realistic eastern boundary current speeds. Significant poleward speeds occur only onshore of where the upper layer intersects the slope, that is, at a grounding line. Its poleward transport increases when surface-enhanced vertical mixing is applied over a greater depth. When the timescale <italic>\u03b4t</italic> is sufficiently short, the poleward current is nearly barotropic. The current's spatial structure over the shelf is controlled by horizontal mixing, having the structure of a Munk layer. Increasing vertical diffusion deepens the upper layer thickness and strengthens the alongshore current speed. Bottom drag leads to an offshore flow along the bottom, reducing the net onshore transport and weakening the current's poleward acceleration. When <italic>\u03b4t</italic> is long, poleward advection of buoyancy forms a density front near the shelf break, intensifying poleward speeds near the surface. With bottom drag, a bottom Ekman flow advects density offshore, shifting the jet core offshore of the shelf break. The resulting cross-shelf density gradient reverses the meridional current's direction at depth, leading to an equatorward undercurrent.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We focus our analysis in austral summer, when the regional wind experiences significant day-to-day variability superimposed on a mean, upwelling favorable flow. To evaluate the nature and magnitude of these effects, we performed three identical simulations except for the surface forcing: the climatological run, with long-term monthly mean wind-stresses and heat fluxes; the wind-synoptic run, with daily wind stresses and climatological heat fluxes; and the full-synoptic run, with daily wind-stresses and daily fluxes. The mean currents and surface geostrophic EKE fields show no major differences between simulations, and agree well with those observed in this ocean area. Nevertheless, substantially more ageostrophic EKE is found in the simulations which include synoptic variability of wind-stresses, impacting the total surface EKE and diffusivities, particularly south of Punta Lavapie (37\u00b0<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>S), where the lack of major currents implies low levels of geostrophic EKE. Summer mean SSTs are similar in all simulations and agree with observations, but SST variability along the coast is larger in the runs including wind-stress synoptic variability, suggesting a rather linear response of the ocean to cycles of southerly wind strengthening and relaxation. We found that coastal SST variability does not change significantly in the first tenths of kilometers from the shore when including daily heat fluxes, highlighting the prominent role of wind-driven upwelling cycles. In contrast, in the offshore region situated beyond the 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km coastal strip, it is necessary to include synoptic variability in the heat fluxes to account for a realistic SST variability.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Velocity profiles were used to quantify the exchange in terms of a transport through each of the two largest passages: Montague Strait and Hinchinbrook Entrance. Buoy wind and atmospheric pressure observations, as well as bottom pressure records, are then used to elucidate the role of atmospheric forcing on the exchange.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0015\" view=\"all\">An EOF analysis shows that the barotropic component accounts for 62% or more of the variance in the velocity profiles even after tides are removed by low-pass filtering, and thus the analysis is concerned primarily with depth-integrated transport. The estimated depth-integrated transport can reach \u00b10.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Sv in Montague Strait, and \u00b11.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Sv in Hinchinbrook Entrance. The largest fluctuations occur in response to the semidiurnal tides. Transport variations on subtidal time scales, which can reach \u22120.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Sv in Montague Strait, and +0.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Sv in Hinchinbrook Entrance, are shown by a frequency domain analysis to be dominated by easterly wind stress events which occur at periods of 2\u20135 days in both summer and winter.

The same winds also raise the sea level in Hinchinbrook Entrance relative to Montague Strait, encouraging an outflow there in agreement with the ADCP observations. There is no evidence that the wind drives a vertically sheared bi-directional flow in either entrance, as has been observed in some estuaries. It is hypothesized that the lack of such a flow is possible because Prince William Sound has two major connections to the shelf, which alters the mass conservation requirement for each passage when compared to a system with just one entrance.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The present paper systematically investigates this system by taking a limit of two modes: shallow and deep convection. Shallow convection destabilizes itself as well as the other convective modes by moistening and cooling the environment, whereas deep convection stabilizes itself as well as the other modes by drying and warming the environment. As a result, shallow convection leads to a runaway growth process in its stand-alone mode, whereas deep convection simply damps out. Interaction between these two convective modes becomes a rich problem, even when it is limited to the case with no large-scale forcing, because of these opposing tendencies. Only if the two modes are coupled at a proper level can a self-sustaining system arise, exhibiting a periodic cycle. The present study establishes the conditions for self-sustaining periodic solutions. It carefully documents the behaviour of the two mode system in order to facilitate the interpretation of global model behaviours when this energy-cycle is implemented as a closure into a convection parameterization in future.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
