China now creates far more Nr than any other country. We developed a budget for Nr...",

All life is based on multiple functions that differ in their elemental requirements, and homeostasis of cellular composition is one of the hallmarks of life. Nevertheless, autotrophs on land and in water have the biological...",

        "description": "It is widely recognized that the stoichiometry of nutrient elements in phytoplankton varies within the ocean. However, there are many conflicting mechanistic explanations for this variability, and it is often ignored in global biogeochemical models and carbon cycle simulations. Here we show that globally distributed particulate P:C varies as a...",

Once laid down, the pattern of streets determines urban form and the level of sprawl for decades to come.
