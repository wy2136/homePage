The survey was\nconducted using an integrated measuring system which consisted of three main\nparts: a single-beam sonar HydroStar 4300 and GPS devices; a Ashtech\nProMark 500 base, and a Thales Z-Max<sup>\u00ae</sup> rover. A\ntotal of 12 851 points were gathered.\n<br><br>\nIn order to find continuous surfaces necessary for analysing the morphology\nof the bed of Lake Vrana, it was necessary to approximate values in certain\nareas that were not directly measured, by using an appropriate interpolation\nmethod. The main aims of this research were as follows: (a) to compare the\nefficiency of 14 different interpolation methods and discover the most\nappropriate interpolators for the development of a raster model; (b) to\ncalculate the surface area and volume of Lake Vrana, and (c) to compare the\ndifferences in calculations between separate raster models. The best\ndeterministic method of interpolation was multiquadric RBF (radio basis function), and the best\ngeostatistical method was ordinary cokriging. The root mean square error in both methods\nmeasured less than 0.3 m.\n<br><br>\nThe quality of the interpolation methods was analysed in two phases. The first\nphase used only points gathered by bathymetric measurement, while the second\nphase also included points gathered by photogrammetric restitution.\n<br><br>\nThe first bathymetric map of Lake Vrana in Croatia was produced, as well as\nscenarios of minimum and maximum water levels. The calculation also included\nthe percentage of flooded areas and cadastre plots in the case of a 2 m\nincrease in the water level. The research presented new scientific and\nmethodological data related to the bathymetric features, surface area and\nvolume of Lake Vrana.",

Chawla and P. P. Mujumdar<br /><br />Quantifying the isolated and integrated impacts of land use (LU) and climate\nchange on streamflow is challenging as well as crucial to optimally manage\nwater resources in river basins. This paper presents a simple hydrologic\nmodeling-based approach to segregate the impacts of land use and climate\nchange on the streamflow of a river basin. The upper Ganga basin (UGB) in India is\nselected as the case study to carry out the analysis. Streamflow in the\nriver basin is modeled using a calibrated variable infiltration capacity\n(VIC) hydrologic model. The approach involves development of three scenarios to\nunderstand the influence of land use and climate on streamflow. The first\nscenario assesses the sensitivity of streamflow to land use changes under\ninvariant climate. The second scenario determines the change in streamflow\ndue to change in climate assuming constant land use. The third scenario\nestimates the combined effect of changing land use and climate over\nthe streamflow of the basin. Based on the results obtained from the three\nscenarios, quantification of isolated impacts of land use and climate change\non streamflow is addressed. Future projections of climate are obtained from\ndynamically downscaled simulations of six general circulation models (GCMs)\navailable from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)\nproject. Uncertainties associated with the GCMs and emission scenarios are\nquantified in the analysis. Results for the case study indicate that\nstreamflow is highly sensitive to change in urban areas and moderately\nsensitive to change in cropland areas. However, variations in streamflow\ngenerally reproduce the variations in precipitation. The combined effect of land\nuse and climate on streamflow is observed to be more pronounced compared to\ntheir individual impacts in the basin. It is observed from the isolated\neffects of land use and climate change that climate has a more dominant\nimpact on streamflow in the region. The approach proposed in this paper is\napplicable to any river basin to isolate the impacts of land use change and\nclimate change on the streamflow.",

W. Ford, A. D. Rapp, S. M. Quiring, and J. Blake<br /><br />Interactions between soil moisture and the atmosphere are driven by the\npartitioning of sensible and latent heating, through which soil moisture\nhas been connected to atmospheric modifications that could potentially lead\nto the initiation of convective precipitation. The majority of previous studies\nlinking the land surface to subsequent precipitation have used atmospheric\nreanalysis or model data sets. In this study, we link in situ observations of soil\nmoisture from more than 100 stations in Oklahoma to subsequent unorganized\nafternoon convective precipitation. We use hourly next generation (NEXRAD) radar-derived\nprecipitation to identify convective events, and then compare the location\nof precipitation initiation to underlying soil moisture anomalies in the\nmorning. Overall we find a statistically significant preference for\nconvective precipitation initiation over drier than normal soils, with over\n70 % of events initiating over soil moisture below the long-term median.\nThe significant preference for precipitation initiation over drier than\nnormal soils is in contrast with previous studies using satellite-based\nprecipitation to identify the region of maximum precipitation accumulation.\nWe evaluated 19 convective events occurring near Lamont, Oklahoma, where\nsoundings of the atmospheric profile at 06:00 and 12:00 LST are also\navailable. For these events, soil moisture has strong negative correlations\nwith the level of free convection (LFC), planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and\nsurface temperature changes between 06:00 and 12:00 LST. We also find strong\npositive correlations between morning soil moisture and morning-to-afternoon\nchanges in convective available potential energy and convective inhibition.\nIn general, the results of this study demonstrate that both positive and\nnegative soil moisture feedbacks are important in this region of the\nUSA.",

Shen, J. Wang, X. Cheng, Y. Rui, and S. Ye<br /><br />The rapid progress of lidar\ntechnology has made the acquirement and application of high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data increasingly popular, especially in regards to\nthe study of floodplain flow. However, high-resolution DEM data pose several\ndisadvantages for floodplain modeling studies; e.g., the data sets contain\nmany redundant interpolation points, large numbers of calculations are\nrequired to work with data, and the data do not match the size of the\ncomputational mesh. Two-dimensional (2-D) hydraulic modeling, which is a\npopular method for analyzing floodplain flow, offers highly precise\nelevation parameterization for computational mesh while ignoring much of the\nmicro-topographic information of the DEM data itself. We offer a flood\nsimulation method that integrates 2-D hydraulic model results and\nhigh-resolution DEM data, thus enabling the calculation of flood water\nlevels in DEM grid cells through local inverse distance-weighted\ninterpolation. To get rid of the false inundation areas during\ninterpolation, it employs the run-length encoding method to mark the\ninundated DEM grid cells and determine the real inundation areas through the\nrun-length boundary tracing technique, which solves the complicated problem\nof connectivity between DEM grid cells. We constructed a 2-D hydraulic model\nfor the Gongshuangcha detention basin, which is a flood storage area of\nDongting Lake in China, by using our integrated method to simulate the\nfloodplain flow. The results demonstrate that this method can solve DEM\nassociated problems efficiently and simulate flooding processes with greater\naccuracy than simulations only with DEM.",

G. Oliveira, O. C. Pedrollo, and N. M. R. Castro<br /><br />The objective of this study was to analyze the changes and uncertainties\nrelated to water availability in the future (for the purposes of this study,\nthe period between 2011 and 2040 was adopted), using a stochastic approach,\ntaking as reference a climate projection from climate model Eta CPTEC/HadCM3.\nThe study was applied to the Iju\u00ed River basin in the south of Brazil. The\nset of methods adopted involved, among others, correcting the climatic\nvariables projected for the future, hydrological simulation using artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) to define a number of monthly flows and stochastic\nmodeling to generate 1000 hydrological series with equal probability of\noccurrence. A multiplicative type stochastic model was developed in which\nmonthly flow is the result of the product of four components: (i) long-term\ntrend component; (ii) cyclic or seasonal component; (iii) time-dependency\ncomponent; and (iv) random component. In general, the results showed a trend\nto increased flows. The mean flow for a long period, for instance, presented\nan alteration from 141.6 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (1961\u20131990) to\n200.3 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (2011\u20132040). An increment in mean flow and in the\nmonthly standard deviation was also observed between the months of January\nand October. Between the months of February and June, the percentage of mean\nmonthly flow increase was more marked, surpassing the 100 % index.\nConsidering the confidence intervals in the flow estimates for the future, it\ncan be concluded that there is a tendency to increase the hydrological\nvariability during the period between 2011 and 2040, which indicates the\npossibility of occurrence of time series with more marked periods of droughts\nand floods.",

F. Rios Gaona, A. Overeem, H. Leijnse, and R. Uijlenhoet<br /><br />Accurate measurements of rainfall are important in many hydrological and\nmeteorological applications, for instance, flash-flood early-warning systems,\nhydraulic structures design, irrigation, weather forecasting, and climate\nmodelling. Whenever possible, link networks measure and store the received\npower of the electromagnetic signal at regular intervals. The decrease in\npower can be converted to rainfall intensity, and is largely due to the\nattenuation by raindrops along the link paths. Such an alternative technique\nfulfils the continuous effort to obtain measurements of rainfall in time and space\nat higher resolutions, especially in places where traditional rain gauge\nnetworks are scarce or poorly maintained.\n<br><br>\nRainfall maps from microwave link networks have recently been introduced at\ncountry-wide scales. Despite their potential in rainfall estimation at high\nspatiotemporal resolutions, the uncertainties present in rainfall maps from\nlink networks are not yet fully comprehended. The aim of this work is to\nidentify and quantify the sources of uncertainty present in interpolated\nrainfall maps from link rainfall depths. In order to disentangle these\nsources of uncertainty, we classified them into two categories: (1) those\nassociated with the individual microwave link measurements, i.e. the errors\ninvolved in link rainfall retrievals, such as wet\nantenna attenuation, sampling interval of measurements, wet/dry period\nclassification, dry weather baseline attenuation, quantization of the\nreceived power, drop size distribution (DSD), and multi-path propagation; and\n(2) those associated with mapping, i.e. the combined effect of the\ninterpolation methodology and the spatial density of link measurements.\n<br><br>\nWe computed ~ 3500 rainfall maps from real and simulated link rainfall\ndepths for 12 days for the land surface of the Netherlands. Simulated link\nrainfall depths refer to path-averaged rainfall depths obtained from radar\ndata. The ~ 3500 real and simulated rainfall maps were compared against\nquality-controlled gauge-adjusted radar rainfall fields (assumed to be the\nground truth). Thus, we were able to not only identify and quantify the\nsources of uncertainty in such rainfall maps, but also test the actual and\noptimal performance of one commercial microwave network from one of the\ncellular providers in the Netherlands. Errors in microwave link measurements\nwere found to be the source that contributes most to the overall uncertainty.",

Snow<br /><br />Beaver dams affect hydrologic processes, channel complexity, and stream\ntemperature in part by inundating riparian areas, influencing\ngroundwater\u2013surface water interactions, and changing fluvial processes\nwithin stream systems. We explored the impacts of beaver dams on hydrologic\nand temperature regimes at different spatial and temporal scales within a\nmountain stream in northern Utah over a 3-year period spanning pre- and\npost-beaver colonization. Using continuous stream discharge, stream\ntemperature, synoptic tracer experiments, and groundwater elevation\nmeasurements, we documented pre-beaver conditions in the first year of the\nstudy. In the second year, we captured the initial effects of three beaver\ndams, while the third year included the effects of ten dams. After beaver\ncolonization, reach-scale (~ 750 m in length) discharge\nobservations showed a shift from slightly losing to gaining. However, at the\nsmaller sub-reach scale (ranging from 56 to 185 m in length), the\ndischarge gains and losses increased in variability due to more complex flow\npathways with beaver dams forcing overland flow, increasing surface and\nsubsurface storage, and increasing groundwater elevations. At the reach\nscale, temperatures were found to increase by 0.38 \u00b0C (3.8 %),\nwhich in part is explained by a 230 % increase in mean reach residence\ntime. At the smallest, beaver dam scale (including upstream ponded area,\nbeaver dam structure, and immediate downstream section), there were notable\nincreases in the thermal heterogeneity where warmer and cooler niches were\ncreated. Through the quantification of hydrologic and thermal changes at\ndifferent spatial and temporal scales, we document increased variability\nduring post-beaver colonization and highlight the need to understand the\nimpacts of beaver dams on stream ecosystems and their potential role in\nstream restoration.",

Herget, and M. J. Machado<br /><br />In recent decades, the quantification of flood hydrological characteristics\n(peak discharge, hydrograph shape, and runoff volume) from documentary\nevidence has gained scientific recognition as a method to lengthen flood\nrecords of rare and extreme events. This paper describes the methodological\nevolution of quantitative historical hydrology under the influence of\ndevelopments in hydraulics and statistics. In the 19th century, discharge\ncalculations based on flood marks were the only source of hydrological data\nfor engineering design, but were later left aside in favour of systematic\ngauge records and conventional hydrological procedures. In the last two\ndecades, there has been growing scientific and public interest in\nunderstanding long-term patterns of rare floods, in maintaining the flood\nheritage and memory of extremes, and developing methods for deterministic and\nstatistical application to different scientific and engineering problems. A\ncompilation of 46 case studies across Europe with reconstructed discharges\ndemonstrates that (1) in most cases present flood magnitudes are not unusual\nwithin the context of the last millennium, although recent floods may exceed\npast floods in some temperate European rivers (e.g. the Vltava and Po\nrivers); (2) the frequency of extreme floods has decreased since the 1950s,\nalthough some rivers (e.g. the Gardon and Ouse rivers) show a reactivation of\nrare events over the last two decades. There is a great potential for gaining\nunderstanding of individual extreme events based on a combined multiproxy\napproach (palaeoflood and documentary records) providing high-resolution time\nflood series and their environmental and climatic changes; and for developing\nnon-systematic and non-stationary statistical models based on relations of\npast floods with external and internal covariates under natural low-frequency\nclimate variability.",

Rinderer, H. C. Komakech, D. M\u00fcller, G. L. B. Wiesenberg, and J. Seibert<br /><br />Soil and water management is particularly relevant in semi-arid regions to\nenhance agricultural productivity. During periods of water scarcity, soil\nmoisture differences are important indicators of the soil water deficit and\nare traditionally used for allocating water resources among farmers of a\nvillage community. Here we present a simple, inexpensive soil wetness\nclassification scheme based on qualitative indicators which one can see or\ntouch on the soil surface. It incorporates the local farmers' knowledge on\nthe best soil moisture conditions for seeding and brick making in the\nsemi-arid environment of the study site near Arusha, Tanzania. The scheme\nwas tested twice in 2014 with farmers, students and experts (April: 40 persons, June: 25 persons) for inter-rater reliability, bias of individuals\nand functional relation between qualitative and quantitative soil moisture\nvalues. During the test in April farmers assigned the same wetness class in\n46 % of all cases, while students and experts agreed on about 60 % of all\ncases. Students who had been trained in how to apply the method gained\nhigher inter-rater reliability than their colleagues with only a basic\nintroduction. When repeating the test in June, participants were given\nimproved instructions, organized in small subgroups, which resulted in a\nhigher inter-rater reliability among farmers. In 66 % of all\nclassifications, farmers assigned the same wetness class and the spread of\nclass assignments was smaller. This study demonstrates that a wetness\nclassification scheme based on qualitative indicators is a robust tool and\ncan be applied successfully regardless of experience in crop growing and\neducation level when an in-depth introduction and training is provided. The\nuse of a simple and clear layout of the assessment form is important for\nreliable wetness class assignments.",

However, with the increased\navailability of precipitation estimates from a wide range of instruments\n(satellite, ground-based radar, and gauge), it is now possible to apply the\ntriple collocation (TC) technique to characterize the uncertainties in each\nof the products. Classical TC takes advantage of three collocated data\nproducts of the same variable and estimates the mean squared error of each,\nwithout requiring knowledge of the truth. In this study, triplets among\nNEXRAD-IV, TRMM 3B42RT, GPCP 1DD, and GPI products are used to quantify the\nassociated spatial error characteristics across a central part of the\ncontinental US. Data are aggregated to biweekly accumulations from January\n2002 through April 2014 across a 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 spatial grid.\nThis is the first study of its kind to explore precipitation estimation\nerrors using TC across the US. A multiplicative (logarithmic) error model is\nincorporated in the original TC formulation to relate the precipitation\nestimates to the unknown truth. For precipitation application, this is more\nrealistic than the additive error model used in the original TC derivations,\nwhich is generally appropriate for existing applications such as in the case\nof wind vector components and soil moisture comparisons. This study provides\nerror estimates of the precipitation products that can be incorporated into\nhydrological and meteorological models, especially those used in data\nassimilation. Physical interpretations of the error fields (related to\ntopography, climate, etc.) are explored. The methodology presented in this\nstudy could be used to quantify the uncertainties associated with\nprecipitation estimates from each of the constellations of GPM satellites.\nSuch quantification is prerequisite to optimally merging these estimates.",

The evaluation revealed three types of clayey\ntill fields characterised by: (i) low net precipitation, high concentration\nof nitrate-N, and short-term low intensity drainage at air temperatures\noften below 5 \u00b0C; (ii) medium net precipitation, medium concentration\nof nitrate-N, and short-term medium-intensity drainage at air temperatures\noften above 5 \u00b0C; and (iii) high net precipitation, low concentration\nof nitrate-N and long-term high intensity drainage at air temperatures above\n5 \u00b0C. For each type, on-field water management actions, such as the\nselection of crop types and introduction of catch crops, appeared relevant,\nwhereas off-field actions only seemed relevant for the latter two field\ntypes given the temperature-dependent reduction potential of nitrate\noff-field. This initial well-documented field-scale knowledge from fields\nthat are representative of large areas in Denmark is a first step towards\nestablishing a differentiated N-regulation for clayey till areas.\nAdditionally, it provides a unique starting point by identifying important\nparameters for future mapping of catchment-scale variations in nitrate\nconcentrations and fluxes.",

Richter, C. D\u00f6ring, M. Jansen, O. Panferov, U. Spank, and C. Bernhofer<br /><br />Among the different bioenergy sources, short rotation coppices (SRC) with\npoplar and willow trees are one of the promising options in Europe. SRC provide not only woody biomass but also additional ecosystem services.\nHowever, a known shortcoming is the potentially lower groundwater recharge\ncaused by the potentially higher evapotranspiration demand compared to\nannual crops. The complex feedbacks between vegetation cover and water cycle\ncan be only correctly assessed by application of well-parameterised and\ncalibrated numerical models. In the present study, the hydrological model system WaSim (Wasserhaushalts-Simulations-Model) is implemented for assessment of the water balance. The focus\nis the analysis of simulation uncertainties caused by the use of guidelines\nor transferred parameter sets from scientific literature compared to\n\"actual\" parameterisations derived from local measurements of leaf area index (LAI), stomatal resistance (Rsc) and date of leaf unfolding (LU). The\nanalysis showed that uncertainties in parameterisation of vegetation lead to\nimplausible model results. LAI, Rsc and LU are the most sensitive plant\nphysiological parameters concerning the effects of enhanced SRC cultivation\non water budget or groundwater recharge. Particularly sensitive is the\nbeginning of the growing season, i.e. LU. When this estimation is wrong, the\naccuracy of LAI and Rsc description plays a minor role. Our analyses\nillustrate that the use of locally measured vegetation parameters, like\nmaximal LAI, and meteorological variables, like air temperature, to estimate\nLU give better results than literature data or data from remote network\nstations. However, the direct implementation of locally measured data is not\nalways advisable or possible. Regarding Rsc, the adjustment of local\nmeasurements gives the best model evaluation. For local and accurate\nstudies, measurements of model sensitive parameters like LAI, Rsc and LU are\nvaluable information. The derivation of these model parameters based on\nlocal measurements shows the best model fit. Additionally, the adjusted\nseasonal course of LAI and Rsc is less sensitive to different estimates for\nLU. Different parameterisations, as they are all eligible either from local\nmeasurements or scientific literature, can result in modelled ground water\nrecharge to be present or completely absent in certain years under poplar\nSRC.",

Maraun and M. Widmann<br /><br />To assess potential impacts of climate change for a specific location, one\ntypically employs climate model simulations at the grid box corresponding to\nthe same geographical location. For most of Europe, this choice is well\njustified. But, based on regional climate simulations, we show that simulated\nclimate might be systematically displaced compared to observations. In\nparticular in the rain shadow of mountain ranges, a local grid box is\ntherefore often not representative of observed climate: the simulated\nwindward weather does not flow far enough across the mountains; local grid\nboxes experience the wrong air masses and atmospheric circulation. In some\ncases, also the local climate change signal is deteriorated. Classical bias\ncorrection methods fail to correct these location errors. Often, however, a\ndistant simulated time series is representative of the considered observed\nprecipitation, such that a non-local bias correction is possible. These\nfindings also clarify limitations of bias correcting global model errors, and\nof bias correction against station data.",

Decker, A. Pitman, and J. Evans<br /><br />The similarity of the temporal variations of land and atmospheric states\nduring the onset (September) through to the peak (February) of the wet season\nover northern Australia is statistically diagnosed using ensembles of offline\nland surface model simulations that produce a range of different background\nsoil moisture states. We derive the temporal correspondence between\nvariations in the soil moisture and the planetary boundary layer via a\nstatistical measure of rank correlation. The simulated evaporative fraction\nand the boundary layer are shown to be strongly correlated during both SON\n(September\u2013October\u2013November) and DJF (December\u2013January\u2013February) despite\nthe differing background soil moisture states between the two seasons and\namong the ensemble members. The sign and magnitude of the boundary\nlayer\u2013surface layer soil moisture association during the onset of the wet\nseason (SON) differs from the correlation between the evaporative fraction\nand boundary layer from the same season, and from the correlation between the\nsurface soil moisture and boundary layer association during DJF. The patterns\nand magnitude of the surface flux\u2013boundary layer correspondence are not\ncaptured when the relationship is diagnosed using the surface layer soil\nmoisture alone. The conflicting results arise because the surface layer soil\nmoisture lacks strong correlation with the atmosphere during the monsoon\nonset because the evapotranspiration is dominated by transpiration. Our\nresults indicate that accurately diagnosing the correspondence and therefore\ncoupling strength in seasonally dry regions, such as northern Australia,\nrequires root zone soil moisture to be included.",

Aggarwal<br /><br />We introduce a new online global database of riverine water stable isotopes\n(Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers, GNIR) and evaluate its longer-term data holdings. Overall, 218 GNIR river\nstations were clustered into three different groups based on the seasonal\nvariation in their isotopic composition, which was closely coupled to\nprecipitation and snowmelt water runoff regimes. Sinusoidal fit functions\nrevealed phases within each grouping and deviations from the sinusoidal\nfunctions revealed important river alterations or hydrological processes in\nthese watersheds. The seasonal isotopic amplitude of \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O in\nrivers averaged 2.5 &permil;, and did not increase as a\nfunction of latitude, like it does for global precipitation. Low seasonal\nisotopic amplitudes in rivers suggest the prevalence of mixing and storage\nsuch as occurs via lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater. The application of a\ncatchment-constrained regionalized cluster-based water isotope prediction\nmodel (CC-RCWIP) allowed for direct comparison between the expected isotopic\ncompositions for the upstream catchment precipitation with the measured\nisotopic composition of river discharge at observation stations. The\ncatchment-constrained model revealed a strong global isotopic correlation\nbetween average rainfall and river discharge (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.88) and the study\ndemonstrated that the seasonal isotopic composition and variation of river\nwater can be predicted. Deviations in data from model-predicted values\nsuggest there are important natural or anthropogenic catchment processes\nlike evaporation, damming, and water storage in the upstream catchment.",

As lysimeters are exposed to several external\nforces such as management practices or wind influencing the weighing data,\nthe calculated fluxes of precipitation and evapotranspiration can be altered\nconsiderably without having applied appropriate corrections to the raw data.\nTherefore, adequate filtering schemes for obtaining most accurate estimates of\nthe water balance components are required. In this study, we use data from\nthe TERENO (TERrestrial ENvironmental\nObservatories) SoilCan research site in Bad Lauchst\u00e4dt to develop a comprehensive\nfiltering procedure for high-precision lysimeter data, which is designed to\ndeal with various kinds of possible errors starting from the elimination of\nlarge disturbances in the raw data resulting e.g., from management practices\nall the way to the reduction of noise caused e.g., by moderate wind.\nFurthermore, we analyze the influence of averaging times and thresholds\nrequired by some of the filtering steps on the calculated water balance and\ninvestigate the ability of two adaptive filtering methods (the adaptive\nwindow and adaptive threshold filter (AWAT filter; Peters et al., 2014), and\na new synchro filter applicable to the data from a set of several lysimeters)\nto further reduce the filtering error. Finally, we take advantage of the data\nsets of all 18 lysimeters running in parallel at the Bad Lauchst\u00e4dt site to\nevaluate the performance and accuracy of the proposed filtering scheme. For\nthe tested time interval of 2 months, we show that the estimation of the\nwater balance with high temporal resolution and good accuracy is possible.\nThe filtering code can be downloaded from the journal website as Supplement\nto this publication.",

A. Matin and C. P.-A. Bourque<br /><br />This study associates the dynamics of enhanced vegetation index in lowland\ndesert oases to the recycling of water in two endorheic (hydrologically\nclosed) river basins in Gansu Province, north-west China, along a gradient of\nelevation zones and land cover types. Each river basin was subdivided into\nfour elevation zones representative of (i) oasis plains and foothills, and\n(ii) low-, (iii) mid-, and (iv) high-mountain elevations. Comparison of\nmonthly vegetation phenology with precipitation and snowmelt dynamics within\nthe same basins over a 10-year period (2000\u20132009) suggested that the onset\nof the precipitation season (cumulative % precipitation > 7\u20138 %)\nin the mountains, typically in late April to early May, was triggered by the\ngreening of vegetation and increased production of water vapour at the base\nof the mountains. Seasonal evolution of in-mountain precipitation correlated\nfairly well with the temporal variation in oasis-vegetation coverage and\nphenology characterised by monthly enhanced vegetation index, yielding\ncoefficients of determination of 0.65 and 0.85 for the two basins. Convergent\ncross-mapping of related time series indicated bi-directional causality\n(feedback) between the two variables. Comparisons between same-zone monthly\nprecipitation amounts and enhanced vegetation index provided weaker\ncorrelations. Start of the growing season in the oases was shown to coincide\nwith favourable spring warming and discharge of meltwater from low- to\nmid-elevations of the Qilian Mountains (zones 1 and 2) in mid-to-late March.\nIn terms of plant requirement for water,\nmid-seasonal development of oasis vegetation was seen to be controlled to a\ngreater extent by the production of rain in the mountains. Comparison of\nwater volumes associated with in-basin production of rainfall and snowmelt\nwith that associated with evaporation seemed to suggest that about 90 %\nof the available liquid water (i.e. mostly in the form of direct rainfall and\nsnowmelt in the mountains) was recycled locally.",

Thielen<br /><br />The <i>African Flood Forecasting System</i> (AFFS) is a probabilistic flood\nforecast system for medium- to large-scale African river basins, with lead\ntimes of up to 15 days. The key components are the hydrological model\nLISFLOOD, the African GIS database, the meteorological ensemble predictions\nby the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Ranged Weather Forecasts) and\ncritical hydrological thresholds. In this paper, the predictive capability is\ninvestigated in a hindcast mode, by reproducing hydrological predictions for\nthe year 2003 when important floods were observed. Results were verified by\nground measurements of 36 sub-catchments as well as by reports of various\nflood archives. Results showed that AFFS detected around 70 % of the\nreported flood events correctly. In particular, the system showed good\nperformance in predicting riverine flood events of long duration\n(> 1 week) and large affected areas (> 10 000 km<sup>2</sup>) well in\nadvance, whereas AFFS showed limitations for small-scale and short duration\nflood events. The case study for the flood event in March 2003 in the Sabi\nBasin (Zimbabwe) illustrated the good performance of AFFS in forecasting\ntiming and severity of the floods, gave an example of the clear and concise\noutput products, and showed that the system is capable of producing flood\nwarnings even in ungauged river basins. Hence, from a technical perspective,\nAFFS shows a large potential as an operational pan-African flood forecasting\nsystem, although issues related to the practical implication will still need\nto be investigated.",

C. Sherriff, J. S. Rowan, A. R. Melland, P. Jordan, O. Fenton, and D. \u00d3 hUallach\u00e1in<br /><br />Soil erosion and suspended sediment (SS) pose risks to chemical and\necological water quality. Agricultural activities may accelerate erosional\nfluxes from bare, poached or compacted soils, and enhance connectivity\nthrough modified channels and artificial drainage networks. Storm-event\nfluxes dominate SS transport in agricultural catchments; therefore, high\ntemporal-resolution monitoring approaches are required, but can be expensive\nand technically challenging. Here, the performance of in situ turbidity\nsensors, conventionally installed submerged at the river bankside, is\ncompared with installations where river water is delivered to sensors ex\nsitu, i.e. within instrument kiosks on the riverbank, at two experimental\ncatchments (Grassland B and Arable B). The in situ and ex situ installations\ngave comparable results when calibrated against storm-period,\ndepth-integrated SS data, with total loads at Grassland B estimated at\n12 800 and 15 400 t, and 22 600 and 24 900 t at Arable B, respectively.\nThe absence of spurious turbidity readings relating to bankside debris around\nthe in situ sensor and its greater security make the ex situ sensor more\nrobust. The ex situ approach was then used to characterise SS dynamics and\nfluxes in five intensively managed agricultural catchments in Ireland which\nfeature a range of landscape characteristics and land use pressures. Average\nannual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was below the Freshwater Fish\nDirective (78/659/EEC) guideline of 25 mg L<sup>\u22121</sup>, and the continuous\nhourly record demonstrated that exceedance occurred less than 12 % of the\nobservation year. Soil drainage class and proportion of arable land were key\ncontrols determining flux rates, but all catchments reported a high degree of\ninter-annual variability associated with variable precipitation patterns\ncompared to the long-term average. Poorly drained soils had greater\nsensitivity to runoff and soil erosion, particularly in catchments with\nperiods of bare soils. Well drained soils were less sensitive to erosion even\non arable land; however, under extreme rainfall conditions, all bare soils\nremain a high sediment loss risk. Analysis of storm-period and seasonal\ndynamics (over the long term) using high-resolution monitoring would be\nbeneficial to further explore the impact of landscape, climate and land use\ncharacteristics on SS export.",
