W. Chaney, J. D. Herman, P. M. Reed, and E. F. Wood<br /><br />Land surface modeling, in conjunction with numerical weather forecasting and\nsatellite remote sensing, is playing an increasing role in global monitoring\nand prediction of extreme hydrologic events (i.e., floods and droughts).\nHowever, uncertainties in the meteorological forcings, model structure, and\nparameter identifiability limit the reliability of model predictions. This\nstudy focuses on the latter by assessing two potential weaknesses that emerge\ndue to limitations in our global runoff observations: (1) the limits of\nidentifying model parameters at coarser timescales than those at which the\nextreme events occur, and (2) the negative impacts of not properly accounting\nfor model parameter equifinality in the predictions of extreme events. To\naddress these challenges, petascale parallel computing is used to perform the\nfirst global-scale, 10 000 member ensemble-based evaluation of plausible\nmodel parameters using the VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) land surface\nmodel, aiming to characterize the impact of parameter identifiability on the\nuncertainty in flood and drought predictions. Additionally, VIC's\nglobal-scale parametric sensitivities are assessed at the annual, monthly,\nand daily timescales to determine whether coarse-timescale observations can\nproperly constrain extreme events. Global and climate type results indicate\nthat parameter uncertainty remains an important concern for predicting\nextreme events even after applying monthly and annual constraints to the\nensemble, suggesting a need for improved prior distributions of the model\nparameters as well as improved observations. This study contributes a\ncomprehensive evaluation of land surface modeling for global flood and\ndrought monitoring and suggests paths forward to overcome the challenges\nposed by parameter uncertainty.",

Regional climate models (RCMs) used in impact studies\noften produce biased time series of meteorological variables. In this study\nbias correction (BC) of RCM temperature and precipitation for Finland is\ncarried out using different versions of the distribution based scaling (DBS)\nmethod. The DBS-adjusted RCM data are used as input of a hydrological model\nto simulate changes in discharges of four study catchments in different parts\nof Finland. The annual mean discharges and seasonal variation simulated with\nthe DBS-adjusted temperature and precipitation data are sufficiently close to\nobserved discharges in the control period 1961\u20132000 and produce more\nrealistic projections for mean annual and seasonal changes in discharges than\nthe uncorrected RCM data. Furthermore, with most scenarios the DBS method\nused preserves the temperature and precipitation trends of the uncorrected\nRCM data during 1961\u20132100. However, if the biases in the mean or the\nstandard deviation of the uncorrected temperatures are large, significant\nbiases after DBS adjustment may remain or temperature trends may change,\nincreasing the uncertainty of climate change projections. The DBS method\ninfluences especially the projected seasonal changes in discharges and the\nuse of uncorrected data can produce unrealistic seasonal discharges and\nchanges. The projected changes in annual mean discharges are moderate or\nsmall, but seasonal distribution of discharges will change significantly.",

Bogena<br /><br />The Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) can provide soil moisture\ninformation at scales relevant to hydrometeorological modelling\napplications. Site-specific calibration is needed to translate CRNS\nneutron intensities into sensor footprint average soil moisture\ncontents. We investigated temporal sampling strategies for\ncalibration of three CRNS parameterisations (modified <i>N</i><sub>0</sub>, HMF,\nand COSMIC) by assessing the effects of the number of sampling days\nand soil wetness conditions on the performance of the calibration\nresults while investigating actual neutron intensity measurements,\nfor three sites with distinct climate and land use: a semi-arid\nsite, a temperate grassland, and a temperate forest. When calibrated\nwith 1 year of data, both COSMIC and the modified <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> method\nperformed better than HMF. The performance of COSMIC was remarkably\ngood at the semi-arid site in the USA, while the <i>N</i><sub>0mod</sub>\nperformed best at the two temperate sites in Germany. The successful\nperformance of COSMIC at all three sites can be attributed to the\nbenefits of explicitly resolving individual soil layers (which is\nnot accounted for in the other two parameterisations). To better\ncalibrate these parameterisations, we recommend in situ soil sampled\nto be collected on more than a single day. However, little\nimprovement is observed for sampling on more than 6 days. At the\nsemi-arid site, the <i>N</i><sub>0mod</sub> method was calibrated better\nunder site-specific average wetness conditions, whereas HMF and\nCOSMIC were calibrated better under drier conditions. Average soil\nwetness condition gave better calibration results at the two humid\nsites. The calibration results for the HMF method were better when\ncalibrated with combinations of days with similar soil wetness\nconditions, opposed to <i>N</i><sub>0mod</sub> and COSMIC, which profited\nfrom using days with distinct wetness conditions. Errors in actual\nneutron intensities were translated to average errors specifically\nto each site. At the semi-arid site, these errors were below the\ntypical measurement uncertainties from in situ point-scale sensors\nand satellite remote sensing products. Nevertheless, at the two\nhumid sites, reduction in uncertainty with increasing sampling days\nonly reached typical errors associated with satellite remote sensing\nproducts. The outcomes of this study can be used by researchers as a\nCRNS calibration strategy guideline.",

In the\nliterature, there exists a variety of methods analysing and predicting uncertainty. However, studies devoted to\ncomparing the performance of the methods in predicting uncertainty are\nlimited. This paper focuses on the methods predicting model residual\nuncertainty that differ in methodological complexity: quantile regression\n(QR) and UNcertainty Estimation based on local Errors and Clustering (UNEEC).\nThe comparison of the methods is aimed at investigating how well a simpler\nmethod using fewer input data performs over a more complex method with more\npredictors. We test these two methods on several catchments from the UK that\nvary in hydrological characteristics and the models used. Special attention\nis given to the methods' performance under different hydrological conditions.\nFurthermore, normality of model residuals in data clusters (identified by\nUNEEC) is analysed. It is found that basin lag time and forecast lead time\nhave a large impact on the quantification of uncertainty and the presence of\nnormality in model residuals' distribution. In general, it can be said that\nboth methods give similar results. At the same time, it is also shown that\nthe UNEEC method provides better performance than QR for small catchments\nwith the changing hydrological dynamics, i.e. rapid response catchments. It\nis recommended that more case studies of catchments of distinct hydrologic\nbehaviour, with diverse climatic conditions, and having various hydrological\nfeatures, be considered.",

Forcing uncertainty is enhanced in\nsnow-affected catchments, where weather stations are scarce and prone to\nmeasurement errors, and meteorological variables exhibit high variability.\nHence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics\naffect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics\nare most important.

We use the Sobol' global\nsensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters  but\nadapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all\nforcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing\nerrors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five\ndifferent scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to\nforcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing\nerror distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings\ndepending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes\nfound in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important\nfactor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance\ntiming, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation\nuncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative\nimportance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest.\nSensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter\nmost for hydrologic modeling.",

Mart\u00ednez-Carreras, C. E. Wetzel, J. Frentress, L. Ector, J. J. McDonnell, L. Hoffmann, and L. Pfister<br /><br />Diatoms (<i>Bacillariophyta</i>) are one of the most common and diverse algal\ngroups (ca. 200 000 species, \u2248 10\u2013200 \u03bcm, unicellular,\neukaryotic). Here we investigate the potential of aerial diatoms (i.e.\ndiatoms nearly exclusively occurring outside water bodies, in wet, moist or\ntemporarily dry places) to infer surface hydrological connectivity between\nhillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) landscape units during storm runoff events.\nWe present data from the Weierbach catchment (0.45 km<sup>2</sup>, northwestern\nLuxembourg) that quantify the relative abundance of aerial diatom species on\nhillslopes and in riparian zones (i.e. surface soils, litter, bryophytes and\nvegetation) and within streams (i.e. stream water, epilithon and epipelon).\nWe tested the hypothesis that different diatom species assemblages inhabit\nspecific moisture domains of the catchment (i.e. HRS units) and,\nconsequently, the presence of certain species assemblages in the stream\nduring runoff events offers the potential for recording whether there was\nhydrological connectivity between these domains or not. We found that a higher percentage of aerial diatom\nspecies was present in samples collected from the riparian and hillslope\nzones than inside the stream. However, diatoms were absent on hillslopes\ncovered by dry litter and the quantities of diatoms (in absolute numbers)\nwere small in the rest of hillslope samples. This limits their use for\ninferring hillslope-riparian zone connectivity. Our results also showed that\naerial diatom abundance in the stream increased systematically during all\nsampled events (<i>n</i> = 11, 2011\u20132012) in response to incident\nprecipitation and increasing discharge. This transport of aerial diatoms\nduring events suggested a rapid connectivity between the soil surface and the\nstream. Diatom transport data were compared to two-component hydrograph\nseparation, and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) using stream water\nchemistry and stable isotope data. Hillslope overland flow was insignificant\nduring most sampled events. This research suggests that diatoms were likely\nsourced exclusively from the riparian zone, since it was not only the largest\naerial diatom reservoir, but also since soil water from the riparian zone was\na major streamflow source during rainfall events under both wet and dry\nantecedent conditions. In comparison to other tracer methods, diatoms require\ntaxonomy knowledge and a rather large processing time. However, they can\nprovide unequivocal evidence of hydrological connectivity and potentially be\nused at larger catchment scales.",

Renard<br /><br />Evapotranspiration has been recognized as one of the most uncertain terms in\nthe surface water balance simulated by land surface models. In this study,\nthe SURFEX/ISBA-A-gs (Interaction Sol\u2013Biosphere\u2013Atmosphere) simulations of evapotranspiration are assessed at the\nfield scale over a 12-year Mediterranean crop succession. The model is\nevaluated in its standard implementation which relies on the use of the ISBA\npedotransfer estimates of the soil properties. The originality of this work\nconsists in explicitly representing the succession of crop cycles and\ninter-crop bare soil periods in the simulations and assessing its impact on\nthe dynamics of simulated and measured evapotranspiration over a long period\nof time. The analysis focuses on key parameters which drive the simulation\nof ET, namely the rooting depth, the soil moisture at saturation, the soil\nmoisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point. A\nsensitivity analysis is first conducted to quantify the relative\ncontribution of each parameter on ET simulation over 12 years. The impact of\nthe estimation method used to retrieve the soil parameters (pedotransfer\nfunction, laboratory and field methods) on ET is then analysed. The benefit\nof representing the variations in time of the rooting depth and wilting\npoint is evaluated. Finally, the propagation of uncertainties in the soil\nparameters on ET simulations is quantified through a Monte Carlo analysis\nand compared with the uncertainties triggered by the mesophyll conductance\nwhich is a key above-ground driver of the stomatal conductance.\n<br><br>\nThis work shows that evapotranspiration mainly results from the soil\nevaporation when it is continuously simulated over a Mediterranean crop\nsuccession. This results in a high sensitivity of simulated\nevapotranspiration to uncertainties in the soil moisture at field capacity\nand the soil moisture at saturation, both  of which drive the simulation of soil\nevaporation. Field capacity was proved to be the most influencing parameter\non the simulation of evapotranspiration over the crop succession. The\nevapotranspiration simulated with the standard surface and soil parameters\nof the model is largely underestimated. The deficit in cumulative\nevapotranspiration amounts to 24 % over 12 years. The bias in daily\ndaytime evapotranspiration is \u22120.24 mm day<sup>\u22121</sup>. The ISBA pedotransfer\nestimates of the soil moisture at saturation and at wilting point are\noverestimated, which explains most of the evapotranspiration underestimation.\nThe use of field capacity values retrieved from laboratory methods leads to\ninaccurate simulation of ET due to the lack of representativeness of the\nsoil structure variability at the field scale. The most accurate simulation\nis achieved with the average values of the soil properties derived from the\nanalysis of field measurements of soil moisture vertical profiles over each\ncrop cycle. The representation of the variations in time of the wilting\npoint and the maximum rooting depth over the crop succession has little\nimpact on the simulation performances. Finally, we show that the\nuncertainties in the soil parameters can generate substantial uncertainties\nin ET simulated over 12 years (the 95 % confidence interval represents\n23 % of cumulative ET over 12 years). Uncertainties in the mesophyll\nconductance have lower impact on ET. Measurement random errors explain a\nlarge part of the scattering between simulations and measurements at\nhalf-hourly timescale. The deficits in simulated ET reported in this work\nare probably larger due to likely underestimation of ET by eddy-covariance\nmeasurements. Other possible model shortcomings include the lack of\nrepresentation of soil vertical heterogeneity and root profile along with\ninaccurate energy balance partitioning between the soil and the vegetation\nat low leaf area index.",

The relative importance of synoptic circulation\nchanges (i.e. trends in synoptic type frequencies) as opposed to trends in\nthe hydrothermal properties of synoptic types (within-type trends) on\nprecipitation and temperature trends in Europe is assessed on a monthly\nbasis. The study is based on mapping spatial and temporal trend patterns and\ntheir variability at a relatively high resolution (0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0;\n monthly) across Europe. Gridded precipitation and\ntemperature data (1963\u20132001) originate from the Watch Forcing Data set and\nsynoptic types are defined by the objective SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG).\nDuring the study period, relatively high influence of synoptic circulation\nchanges are found from January to March, contributing to wetting trends in\nnorthern Europe and drying in the south. Simultaneously, particularly dry\nsynoptic types get warmer first in south-western Europe in November and/or December\nand affect most of Europe in March and/or April. Strong influence of\nsynoptic circulation changes is again found in June and August. In general,\nchanges in synoptic circulation has a stronger effect on climate trends in north-western\nEurope than in the south-east. The exact locations of the strongest\ninfluence of synoptic circulation changes vary with the time of year and to\nsome degree between precipitation and temperature.

Lucht<br /><br />Global agricultural production is heavily sustained by irrigation, but\nirrigation system efficiencies are often surprisingly low. However, our\nknowledge of irrigation efficiencies is mostly confined to rough indicative\nestimates for countries or regions that do not account for spatiotemporal\nheterogeneity due to climate and other biophysical dependencies. To allow for\nrefined estimates of global agricultural water use, and of water saving and\nwater productivity potentials constrained by biophysical processes and also\nnon-trivial downstream effects, we incorporated a process-based\nrepresentation of the three major irrigation systems (surface, sprinkler, and\ndrip) into a bio- and agrosphere model, LPJmL. Based on this enhanced model\nwe provide a gridded world map of irrigation efficiencies that are calculated\nin direct linkage to differences in system types, crop types, climatic and\nhydrologic conditions, and overall crop management. We find pronounced\nregional patterns in beneficial irrigation efficiency (a refined irrigation\nefficiency indicator accounting for crop-productive water consumption only),\ndue to differences in these features, with the lowest values (< 30 %) in south\nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa and the highest values (> 60 %) in Europe and North\nAmerica. We arrive at an estimate of global irrigation water withdrawal of\n2469 km<sup>3</sup> (2004\u20132009 average); irrigation water consumption is calculated\nto be 1257 km<sup>3</sup>, of which 608 km<sup>3</sup> are non-beneficially consumed,\ni.e., lost through evaporation, interception, and conveyance. Replacing surface\nsystems by sprinkler or drip systems could, on average across the world's\nriver basins, reduce the non-beneficial consumption at river basin level by\n54 and 76 %, respectively, while maintaining the current level of crop\nyields. Accordingly, crop water productivity would increase by 9 and 15 %,\nrespectively, and by much more in specific regions such as in the Indus\nbasin. This study significantly advances the global quantification of\nirrigation systems while providing a framework for assessing potential future\ntransitions in these systems. In this paper, presented opportunities associated with\nirrigation improvements are significant and suggest that they should be\nconsidered an important means on the way to sustainable food security.",

No fewer than 12 of the 14 historically\nrecorded extreme events between 1480 and the termination of the Hasli\u2013Aare\nriver channel correction in 1875 were also identified by coarse-grained\nflood layers, log(Zr / Ti) peaks and factor 1 anomalies. Geomorphological,\nhistorical and instrumental data provide evidence for flood damage\nintensities and discharge estimations of severe and catastrophic historical\nfloods.\n<br><br>\nSpectral analysis of the geochemical and documentary flood series and\nseveral climate proxies (TSI, \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O, tree-rings, NAO, SNAO)\nidentify similar periodicities of around 60, 80, 100, 120 and 200 years\nduring the last millennia, indicating the influence of the North Atlantic\ncirculation and solar forcing on alpine flood dynamics. The composite\nfloodplain record illustrates that periods of organic soil formation and\ndeposition of phyllosilicates (from the medium high catchment area) match\nthose of total solar irradiance maxima, suggesting reduced flood activity\nduring warmer climate pulses. Aggradation with multiple sets of flood layers\nwith increased contribution of siliciclasts from the highest catchment area\n(plutonic bedrock) (e.g. 1300\u20131350, 1420\u20131480, 1550\u20131620, 1650\u20131720 and\n1811\u20131851 cal yr AD) occurred predominantly during periods with reduced\nsolar irradiance, lower \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O anomalies, cooler summer\ntemperatures and phases of drier spring climate in the Alps. Increased water\nstorage by glaciers, snow cover and snow patches susceptible to melting\nprocesses associated with rainfall episodes and abrupt rises in temperature\nsubstantially increased surface runoff on slopes and discharges of alpine\nrivers. This interpretation is in agreement with the findings that the\nsevere and catastrophic historical floods in the Aare since 1670 occurred\nmostly during positive SNAO (Summer North Atlantic Oscillation) pulses after years or even decades dominated by\nnegative SNAO and cooler annual temperatures.",

Hawtree, J. P. Nunes, J. J. Keizer, R. Jacinto, J. Santos, M. E. Rial-Rivas, A.-K. Boulet, F. Tavares-Wahren, and K.-H. Feger<br /><br />The north-central region of Portugal has undergone significant land cover\nchange since the early 1900s, with large-scale replacement of natural\nvegetation types with plantation forests. This transition consisted of an\ninitial conversion primarily to <i>Pinus pinaster</i>, followed by a secondary transition to\n<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>. This land cover change is likely to have altered the hydrologic\nfunctioning of this region; however, these potential impacts are not fully\nunderstood. To contribute to a better understanding of the potential\nhydrologic impacts of this land cover change, this study examines the\ntemporal trends in 75 years of data from the \u00c1gueda watershed (part of\nthe Vouga Basin) over the period of 1936\u20132010. A number of\nhydrometeorological variables were analyzed using a combined Thiel\u2013Sen/Mann\u2013Kendall\ntrend-testing approach, to assess the magnitude and\nsignificance of patterns in the observed data. These trend tests indicated\nthat there have been no significant reductions in streamflow over either the\nentire test period, or during sub-record periods, despite the large-scale\nafforestation which has occurred. This lack of change in streamflow is\nattributed to the specific characteristics of the watershed and land cover\nchange. By contrast, a number of significant trends were found for baseflow\nindex, with positive trends in the early data record (primarily during\n<i>Pinus pinaster</i> afforestation), followed by negative trends later in the data record\n(primarily during <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> afforestation). These trends are attributed to land use\nand vegetation impacts on streamflow generating processes, both due to\nspecies differences and to alterations in soil properties (i.e., infiltration\ncapacity, soil water repellency). These results highlight the importance of\nconsidering both vegetation types/dynamics and watershed characteristic when\nassessing hydrologic impacts, in particular with respect to soil properties.",

On the basis of the AIR survey, the longitudinal temperature\npatterns of the studied rivers differed noticeably. The stable isotopes and\nDSi composition revealed major differences between the studied rivers. The\ngroundwater discharge locations identified in the proximity of 12 municipal water\nintake plants during the low-flow seasons should be considered as potential\nrisk areas for water intake plants during flood periods (groundwater quality\ndeterioration due to bank infiltration), and should be taken under\nconsideration in river basin management under changing climatic situations.",

In an attempt to reduce the required number of ensemble members, an\nadaptive localization method is used. The performance of the adaptive\nlocalization method is compared to the more common distance-based\nlocalization. The relationship between filter performance in terms of\nhydraulic head and discharge error and the number of ensemble members is\ninvestigated for varying numbers and spatial distributions of groundwater\nhead observations and with or without discharge assimilation and parameter\nestimation. The study shows that (1) more ensemble members are needed when\nfewer groundwater head observations are assimilated, and (2) assimilating\ndischarge observations and estimating parameters requires a much larger\nensemble size than just assimilating groundwater head observations. However,\nthe required ensemble size can be greatly reduced with the use of adaptive\nlocalization, which by far outperforms distance-based localization. The\nstudy is conducted using synthetic data only.",

Bre\u00f1a-Naranjo<br /><br />This investigation aims to study the propagation of meteorological\nuncertainty within a cascade modelling approach to flood prediction. The\nmethodology was comprised of a  numerical weather prediction  (NWP) model, a\ndistributed rainfall\u2013runoff model and a 2-D hydrodynamic model. The\nuncertainty evaluation was carried out at the meteorological and hydrological\nlevels of the model chain, which enabled the investigation of how errors\nthat originated in the rainfall prediction  interact at a catchment level and\npropagate to an estimated inundation area and depth. For this, a hindcast\nscenario is utilised removing non-behavioural ensemble members at each stage,\nbased on the fit with observed data. At the hydrodynamic level, an\nuncertainty assessment was not incorporated; instead, the model was setup\nfollowing guidelines for the best possible representation of the case study.\nThe selected extreme event corresponds to a flood that took place in the\nsoutheast of Mexico during November 2009, for which field data (e.g. rain\ngauges; discharge) and satellite imagery were available. Uncertainty in the\nmeteorological model was estimated by means of a multi-physics ensemble\ntechnique, which is designed to represent errors from our limited knowledge\nof the processes generating precipitation. In the hydrological model, a\nmulti-response validation was implemented through the definition of six sets\nof plausible parameters from past flood events. Precipitation fields from the\nmeteorological model were employed as input in a distributed hydrological\nmodel, and resulting flood hydrographs were used as forcing conditions in the\n2-D hydrodynamic model. The evolution of skill within the model cascade shows\na complex aggregation of errors between models, suggesting that in\nvalley-filling events hydro-meteorological uncertainty has a larger effect on\ninundation depths than that observed in estimated flood inundation extents.",

It was found that in a typical aquifer, the error in\n<i>h</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>) at an early point in time is mainly caused by the random initial condition, and the error\nreduces as time progresses to reach a constant error at a later time. The\nduration for which the effect of the random initial condition is\nsignificant may be a few hundred days in most aquifers. The constant error\nin <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>) at a later time is due to the combined effects of the uncertainties in the\nsource/sink and flux boundary: the closer to the flux boundary, the larger\nthe error. The error caused by the uncertain head boundary is limited to a\nnarrow zone near the boundary and remains more or less constant over time.\nThe aquifer system behaves as a low-pass filter which filters out\nhigh-frequency noises and keeps low-frequency variations.

J. Gleason, L. C. Smith, D. C. Finnegan, A. L. LeWinter, L. H Pitcher, and V. W. Chu<br /><br />River systems in remote environments are often challenging to monitor and\nunderstand where traditional gauging apparatus are difficult to install or\nwhere safety concerns prohibit field measurements. In such cases, remote\nsensing, especially terrestrial time-lapse imaging platforms, offer a means\nto better understand these fluvial systems. One such environment is found at\nthe proglacial Isortoq River in southwestern Greenland, a river with a\nconstantly shifting floodplain and remote Arctic location that make gauging\nand in situ measurements all but impossible. In order to derive relevant\nhydraulic parameters for this river, two true color (RGB) cameras were\ninstalled in July 2011, and these cameras collected over 10 000 half hourly\ntime-lapse images of the river by September of 2012. Existing approaches for\nextracting hydraulic parameters from RGB imagery require manual or supervised\nclassification of images into water and non-water areas, a task that was\nimpractical for the volume of data in this study. As such, automated image\nfilters were developed that removed images with environmental obstacles\n(e.g., shadows, sun glint, snow) from the processing stream. Further image\nfiltering was accomplished via a novel automated histogram similarity\nfiltering process. This similarity filtering allowed successful (mean\naccuracy 79.6 %) supervised classification of filtered images from\ntraining data collected from just 10 % of those images. Effective width,\na hydraulic parameter highly correlated with discharge in braided rivers, was\nextracted from these classified images, producing a hydrograph proxy for the\nIsortoq River between 2011 and 2012. This hydrograph proxy shows agreement\nwith historic flooding observed in other parts of Greenland in July 2012 and\noffers promise that the imaging platform and processing methodology presented\nhere will be useful for future monitoring studies of remote rivers.",

F. M\u00fcller and S. E. Thompson<br /><br />We introduce topological restricted maximum likelihood (TopREML) as \na method to predict runoff signatures in ungauged\nbasins. The approach is based on the use of linear mixed models with\nspatially correlated random effects. The nested nature of streamflow networks\nis taken into account by using water balance considerations to constrain the\ncovariance structure of runoff and to account for the stronger spatial\ncorrelation between flow-connected basins. The restricted maximum likelihood\n(REML) framework generates the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of both\nthe predicted variable and the associated prediction uncertainty, even when\nincorporating observable covariates into the model. The method was\nsuccessfully tested in cross-validation analyses on mean streamflow and\nrunoff frequency in Nepal (sparsely gauged) and Austria (densely gauged),\nwhere it matched the performance of comparable methods in the prediction of\nthe considered runoff signature, while significantly outperforming them in\nthe prediction of the associated modeling uncertainty. The ability of TopREML to\ncombine deterministic and stochastic information to generate BLUPs of the\nprediction variable and its uncertainty makes it a particularly versatile\nmethod that can readily be applied in both densely gauged basins, where it\ntakes advantage of spatial covariance information, and data-scarce regions,\nwhere it can rely on covariates, which are increasingly observable via remote-sensing technology.",
