Its associated storm surge breached the extensive levee system that had protected the city. Nearly 2000 residents died, and damages exceeded $100 billion. The storm remains the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, and the resulting economic, social, and environmental turmoil led to the largest mass migration since the U.S. Civil War. A distinguished panel* of scientists and engineers who had been on the scene of Katrina was convened on the eve of the 10th anniversary of this event to address the question: Are American cities better prepared for the next major hurricane?\nAuthor: Marcia McNutt",

        "description": "Brazilian scientists are facing one of the nation's worst funding climates in decades. Battling a slumping economy and debt, Brazil's federal government has taken an ax to spending, and it isn't sparing science. President Dilma Rousseff's administration has cut by 25% the Ministry of Science's projected 2015 budget, and sliced 9% from the budget of the Ministry of Education, which plays an important role in funding graduate students. Research agencies are withholding money for grants that have already been awarded, and have canceled or postponed new calls for proposals. And Rousseff is redirecting funds once earmarked largely for research to send Brazilian students abroad to study. The funding climate is \"the worst in 20 years,\" says Helena Nader, president of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science. At the root of the problem are changes in how Brazil's government spends the royalties generated by Brazil's lucrative offshore oil fields, which have been a major source of funding for science and technology development. In recent years, Brazil's government has redirected much of the oil revenue to other priorities, including health care and education.\nAuthor: Herton Escobar",

On the down side, of the 100 prominent papers analyzed, only 39% could be replicated unambiguously, as a group of 270 researchers describes on page 943. On the up side, despite the sobering results, the effort seems to have drawn little of the animosity that greeted a similar replication effort last year. This time around, even some of the original authors see the replications as a useful addition to their own research. \"This is how science works,\" says Joshua Correll, a psychologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and one of the authors whose results could not be replicated. \"How else will we converge on the truth? Really, the surprising thing is that this kind of systematic attempt at replication is not more common.\" That's encouraging news to Brian Nosek, a psychologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who led the mass replication effort, which began in 2011 with the goal of putting psychological science on more rigorous experimental footing.\nAuthor: John Bohannon",

Now, scientists are converging on an explanation, at least for a fraction of the ALS cases caused by a mutation also associated with a kind of dementia. In cells with the mutation, the new work shows, pores in the membrane separating the nucleus and cytoplasm become clogged, preventing vital molecules from passing through and creating a fatal cellular traffic jam. For now, the work applies only to the mutation dubbed C9orf72\u2014a DNA stutter in which a short nucleotide sequence, GGGGCC, is repeated hundreds to thousands of times in a gene on chromosome 9. Nor do the multiple labs reporting results this week agree on exactly what plugs those nuclear pores and how the cells die. Still, many in the field are calling the work a major breakthrough, and say the findings could point to new therapies, as well as a novel mechanism for neurodegeneration.\nAuthor: Emily Underwood",

Now, a privately funded company has taken what some physicists say is a significant step toward mastering fusion energy with a smaller, cheaper, faster approach. Tri Alpha Energy announced this week that it has built a machine that forms a ball of gas\u2014superheated to about 10 million degrees Celsius\u2014and holds it steady for 5 milliseconds without decaying. Those conditions are well short of what is needed for fusion, but the feat shows for the first time that Tri Alpha's unorthodox approach can trap hot fusion gas in a steady state. Now, the scientists hope to scale up the technique toward times and temperatures that cause atomic nuclei in the gas to fuse together, releasing energy.\nAuthor: Daniel Clery",

A new family tree shows how they owe their diversity to a series of innovations that individually or jointly touched off explosions of new species. The pace of diversification rose after orchids developed a way to lump their pollen into balls called pollinia, which allowed them to exclusively rely on certain insect species for pollination. Many lineages benefited from the evolution of a kind of water-saving photosynthesis. A shift to living in trees opened up many niches, as did a move into tropical mountains such as the Andes.\nAuthor: Erik Stokstad",

Biologists estimate nearly half of U.S. species are imperiled, whereas about a third of the world's crayfish are. Spurred by growing concerns that pollution, habitat destruction, and other threats are placing many crayfish species in harm's way, federal officials are taking a hard look at whether to give legal protection to two: the Guyandotte River crayfish found in southern West Virginia and the Big Sandy crayfish found in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. If the listings go through, a broad range of economically important activities that affect the crayfish, including mining, logging, and recreation, could feel an impact.

        "description": "Today's most successful religions have one thing in common: moralizing gods that care about how people treat one another and will punish those who are selfish and cruel. But for most of human history, these \"big gods\" were the exception. If today's hunter-gatherers are any guide, for thousands of years our ancestors conceived of deities as utterly indifferent to the human realm, and to whether we behaved well or badly. Now, to crack the mystery of why and how people around the world came to believe in moralizing gods, researchers are using a novel tool in religious studies: the scientific method. By combining laboratory experiments, cross-cultural fieldwork, and analysis of the historical record, an interdisciplinary team has proposed that belief in judgmental deities was key to the cooperation needed to build and sustain large, complex societies. And once big gods and big societies existed, their moralizing deities helped religions as dissimilar as Islam and Mormonism to spread by making groups of the faithful more cooperative and therefore more successful. Critics say the big gods team is projecting modern values onto ancient cultures, and that belief in moralizing deities is a byproduct of other social changes. To settle the debate, researchers are looking for quantitative data in novel places, including the historical record.\nAuthor: Lizzie Wade",

And what does \"moralizing\" really mean at different times and in difficult cultures? To answer these questions in a rigorous, scientific way, he and his colleagues are trying to convince historians to turn the nuanced knowledge in their heads into the kind of data scientists need: a database's binary code of yes/no answers.

Natural examples of gene drive from Drosophila include sex-ratio meiotic drive, segregation distortion, and replicative transposition. Synthetic drive systems based on selective embryonic lethality or homing endonucleases have been described previously in Drosophila melanogaster (1\u20133), but they are difficult to build or are limited to transgenic populations. In contrast, RNAguided gene drives based on the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease can, in principle, be constructed by any laboratory capable of making transgenic organisms (4). They have tremendous potential to address global problems in health, agriculture, and conservation, but their capacity to alter wild populations outside the laboratory demands caution (4\u20137). Just as researchers working with self-propagating pathogens must ensure that these agents do not escape to the outside world, scientists working in the laboratory with gene drive constructs are responsible for keeping them confined (4, 6, 7).\nAuthors: Omar S.

In turn, bacterial signals shape immunity in the intestine, promoting intestinal homeostasis in part by inducing and expanding specialized regulatory T (Treg) cells that prevent aberrant inflammatory responses to self and environmental stimuli (1). On pages 989 and 993 of this issue, Ohnmacht et al. (2) and Sefik et al. (3), respectively, report the development and function of a subpopulation of Treg cells found primarily in the large intestine, and characterized by expression of the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t). This is surprising because ROR\u03b3t classically promotes the differentiation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells, a population associated with tissue inflammation in many inflammatory diseases (4). Both studies show that microbiota-derived signals induce the expression of ROR\u03b3t in Treg cells that control intestinal inflammation (see the figure). These findings highlight the diversity of colonic Treg cells, their complex transcriptional programs, and their important role in the intestine.\nAuthors: Ahmed N. Hegazy, Fiona Powrie",

        "description": "Colloidal particles with well-controlled shapes and interactions are an ideal experimental system for exploring how matter organizes itself. Like atoms and molecules, these particles form bulk phases such as liquids and crystals. But they are more than just crude analogs of atoms; they are a form of matter in their own right, with complex and interesting collective behavior not seen at the atomic scale. Their behavior is affected by geometrical or topological constraints, such as curved surfaces or the shapes of the particles. Because the interactions between the particles are often short-ranged, we can understand the effects of these constraints using geometrical concepts such as packing. The geometrical viewpoint gives us a window into how entropy affects not only the structure of matter, but also the dynamics of how it forms.\nAuthor: Vinothan N. Manoharan",

Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) stands out in this regard because of its high speed and low illumination intensities, but typically offers only a twofold resolution gain. We extended the resolution of live-cell SIM through two approaches: ultrahigh numerical aperture SIM at 84-nanometer lateral resolution for more than 100 multicolor frames, and nonlinear SIM with patterned activation at 45- to 62-nanometer resolution for approximately 20 to 40 frames. We applied these approaches to image dynamics near the plasma membrane of spatially resolved assemblies of clathrin and caveolin, Rab5a in early endosomes, and \u03b1-actinin, often in relationship to cortical actin. In addition, we examined mitochondria, actin, and the Golgi apparatus dynamics in three dimensions.\nAuthors: Dong Li, Lin Shao, Bi-Chang Chen, Xi Zhang, Mingshu Zhang, Brian Moses, Daniel E.

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.\nAuthor:  ",

In strongly correlated electron systems, the prefactor A of this T2 resistivity scales with the magnitude of the electronic specific heat, \u03b3. Here we show that one can change the magnitude of A by four orders of magnitude in metallic strontium titanate (SrTiO3) by tuning the concentration of the carriers and, consequently, the Fermi energy. The T2 behavior persists in the single-band dilute limit despite the absence of two known mechanisms for T2 behavior: distinct electron reservoirs and Umklapp processes. The results highlight the absence of a microscopic theory for momentum decay through electron-electron scattering in various Fermi liquids.\nAuthors: Xiao Lin, Beno\u00eet Fauqu\u00e9, Kamran Behnia",

We used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to show that current in a magnetized topological insulator heterostructure (EuS/Bi2Se3) flows at the edge when the Fermi level is gate-tuned to the surface band gap. We further induced micrometer-scale magnetic structures on the heterostructure and detected a chiral edge current at the magnetic domain boundary. The chirality of the current was determined by magnetization of the surrounding domain, and its magnitude by the local chemical potential rather than the applied current. Such magnetic structures provide a platform for detecting topological magnetoelectric effects and may enable progress in quantum information processing and spintronics.\nAuthors: Y. H. Wang, J. R.

Even in the ground state, its position will always have fluctuations, called the zero-point motion. Although the zero-point fluctuations are unavoidable, they can be manipulated. Using microwave frequency radiation pressure, we have manipulated the thermal fluctuations of a micrometer-scale mechanical resonator to produce a stationary quadrature-squeezed state with a minimum variance of 0.80 times that of the ground state. We also performed phase-sensitive, back-action evading measurements of a thermal state squeezed to 1.09 times the zero-point level. Our results are relevant to the quantum engineering of states of matter at large length scales, the study of decoherence of large quantum systems, and for the realization of ultrasensitive sensing of force and motion.\nAuthors: E.

However, many materials have a high propensity to crystallize and are difficult to formulate in an amorphous structure without stabilizers. We fabricated a microfluidic nebulator that can produce amorphous NPs from a wide range of materials, even including pure table salt (NaCl). By using supersonic air flow, the nebulator produces drops that are so small that they dry before crystal nuclei can form. The small size of the resulting spray-dried a-NPs limits the probability of crystal nucleation in any given particle during storage. The kinetic stability of the a-NPs\u2014on the order of months\u2014is advantageous for hydrophobic drug molecules.\nAuthors: Esther Amstad, Manesh Gopinadhan, Christian Holtze, Chinedum O.

In binary choice tests, females\u2019 preferences favored stimulus caller B over caller A; however, with the addition of an inferior \u201cdecoy\u201d C, females reversed their preferences and chose A over B.

        "description": "Life history theory attempts to explain why species differ in offspring number and quality, growth rate, and parental effort. I show that unappreciated interactions of these traits in response to age-related mortality risk challenge traditional perspectives and explain life history evolution in songbirds. Counter to a long-standing paradigm, tropical songbirds grow at similar overall rates to temperate species but grow wings relatively faster. These growth tactics are favored by predation risk, both in and after leaving the nest, and are facilitated by greater provisioning of individual offspring by parents. Increased provisioning of individual offspring depends on partitioning effort among fewer young because of constraints on effort from adult and nest mortality. These growth and provisioning responses to mortality risk finally explain the conundrum of small clutch sizes of tropical birds.\nAuthor: Thomas E. Martin",

        "description": "The global biogeography of microorganisms remains largely unknown, in contrast to the well-studied diversity patterns of macroorganisms. We used arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus DNA from 1014 plant-root samples collected worldwide to determine the global distribution of these plant symbionts. We found that AM fungal communities reflected local environmental conditions and the spatial distance between sites. However, despite AM fungi apparently possessing limited dispersal ability, we found 93% of taxa on multiple continents and 34% on all six continents surveyed. This contrasts with the high spatial turnover of other fungal taxa and with the endemism displayed by plants at the global scale. We suggest that the biogeography of AM fungi is driven by unexpectedly efficient dispersal, probably via both abiotic and biotic vectors, including humans.\nAuthors: J. Davison, M.

        "description": "Glycerophospholipids, the structural components of cell membranes, have not been considered to be spatial cues for intercellular signaling because of their ubiquitous distribution. We identified lyso-phosphatidyl-\u03b2-d-glucoside (LysoPtdGlc), a hydrophilic glycerophospholipid, and demonstrated its role in modality-specific repulsive guidance of spinal cord sensory axons. LysoPtdGlc is locally synthesized and released by radial glia in a patterned spatial distribution to regulate the targeting of nociceptive but not proprioceptive central axon projections. Library screening identified the G protein\u2013coupled receptor GPR55 as a high-affinity receptor for LysoPtdGlc, and GPR55 deletion or LysoPtdGlc loss of function in vivo caused the misallocation of nociceptive axons into proprioceptive zones. These findings show that LysoPtdGlc/GPR55 is a lipid-based signaling system in glia-neuron communication for neural development.\nAuthors: Adam T.

        "description": "DNA strand exchange plays a central role in genetic recombination across all kingdoms of life, but the physical basis for these reactions remains poorly defined. Using single-molecule imaging, we found that bacterial RecA and eukaryotic Rad51 and Dmc1 all stabilize strand exchange intermediates in precise three-nucleotide steps. Each step coincides with an energetic signature (0.3 kBT) that is conserved from bacteria to humans. Triplet recognition is strictly dependent on correct Watson-Crick pairing. Rad51, RecA, and Dmc1 can all step over mismatches, but only Dmc1 can stabilize mismatched triplets. This finding provides insight into why eukaryotes have evolved a meiosis-specific recombinase. We propose that canonical Watson-Crick base triplets serve as the fundamental unit of pairing interactions during DNA recombination.\nAuthors: Ja Yil Lee, Tsuyoshi Terakawa, Zhi Qi, Justin B.

        "description": "Human mutations that truncate the massive sarcomere protein titin [TTN-truncating variants (TTNtvs)] are the most common genetic cause for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a major cause of heart failure and premature death. Here we show that cardiac microtissues engineered from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a powerful system for evaluating the pathogenicity of titin gene variants. We found that certain missense mutations, like TTNtvs, diminish contractile performance and are pathogenic. By combining functional analyses with RNA sequencing, we explain why truncations in the A-band domain of TTN cause DCM, whereas truncations in the I band are better tolerated. Finally, we demonstrate that mutant titin protein in iPS cell\u2013derived cardiomyocytes results in sarcomere insufficiency, impaired responses to mechanical and \u03b2-adrenergic stress, and attenuated growth factor and cell signaling activation. Our findings indicate that titin mutations cause DCM by disrupting critical linkages between sarcomerogenesis and adaptive remodeling.\nAuthors: John T.

        "description": "A challenge of synthetic biology is the creation of cooperative microbial systems that exhibit population-level behaviors. Such systems use cellular signaling mechanisms to regulate gene expression across multiple cell types. We describe the construction of a synthetic microbial consortium consisting of two distinct cell types\u2014an \u201cactivator\u201d strain and a \u201crepressor\u201d strain. These strains produced two orthogonal cell-signaling molecules that regulate gene expression within a synthetic circuit spanning both strains. The two strains generated emergent, population-level oscillations only when cultured together. Certain network topologies of the two-strain circuit were better at maintaining robust oscillations than others. The ability to program population-level dynamics through the genetic engineering of multiple cooperative strains points the way toward engineering complex synthetic tissues and organs with multiple cell types.\nAuthors: Ye Chen, Jae Kyoung Kim, Andrew J.

        "description": "Changes to the symbiotic microbiota early in life, or the absence of it, can lead to exacerbated type 2 immunity and allergic inflammations. Although it is unclear how the microbiota regulates type 2 immunity, it is a strong inducer of proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestine. Here, we report that microbiota-induced Tregs express the nuclear hormone receptor ROR\u03b3t and differentiate along a pathway that also leads to TH17 cells. In the absence of ROR\u03b3t+ Tregs, TH2-driven defense against helminths is more efficient, whereas TH2-associated pathology is exacerbated. Thus, the microbiota regulates type 2 responses through the induction of type 3 ROR\u03b3t+ Tregs and TH17 cells and acts as a key factor in balancing immune responses at mucosal surfaces.\nAuthors: Caspar Ohnmacht, Joo-Hong Park, Sascha Cording, James B.

We now report that symbiotic members of the human gut microbiota induce a distinct Treg population in the mouse colon, which constrains immuno-inflammatory responses. This induction\u2014which we find to map to a broad, but specific, array of individual bacterial species\u2014requires the transcription factor Ror\u03b3, paradoxically, in that Ror\u03b3 is thought to antagonize FoxP3 and to promote T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation. Ror\u03b3\u2019s transcriptional footprint differs in colonic Tregs and TH17 cells and controls important effector molecules. Ror\u03b3, and the Tregs that express it, contribute substantially to regulating colonic TH1/TH17 inflammation. Thus, the marked context-specificity of Ror\u03b3 results in very different outcomes even in closely related cell types.\nAuthors: Esen Sefik, Naama Geva-Zatorsky, Sungwhan Oh, Liza Konnikova, David Zemmour, Abigail Manson McGuire, Dalia Burzyn, Adriana Ortiz-Lopez, Mercedes Lobera, Jianfei Yang, Shomir Ghosh, Ashlee Earl, Scott B.
