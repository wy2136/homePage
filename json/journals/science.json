        "description": "Human activity has had enormous effects on the species composition of floras and faunas, creating new ecological biomes worldwide. A principal challenge in forestry research and conservation is how to deal with these novel ecosystems. Most attention to this phenomenon is centered on the negative effects of species introductions and the need to stem the tide of species invasion. However, we need to scientifically understand new ecosystems and learn to recognize adaptive species combinations that will function sustainably in changing environmental conditions.\nAuthor: Ariel E.

Today, the park is at the center of anoil and gas boom that archaeologists, environmentalists, and Native American activists say threatens a broader landscape filled with hundreds of Chacoan sites. Earlier this month, Chaco experts presented a plan to slow down the granting of drilling leases close to the park. They are also preparing a white paper arguing that the widest possible region around Chaco Canyon should be protected from drilling. Meanwhile, environmental and Native American groups have gone to court to block 239 pending drilling permits in the Chaco area.\nAuthor: Michael Balter",

        "description": "No researchers have applied for required federal permits to conduct invasive research on chimpanzees living in the United States. That suggests that all U.S. biomedical research on chimps has stopped\u2014or is about to stop\u2014and it's unclear whether the work will ever start again. Research on chimpanzees has been waning since 2013, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it would phase out most government-funded chimp research and retire the majority of its research chimps to sanctuaries. The most recent blow came in June, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that all chimpanzees in the United States\u2014including the more than 700 chimps used in research\u2014would be classified as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Any labs that wished to continue invasive work on these animals would need to apply for an ESA permit, and the agency would grant permits only for work that enhances the survival of the species and benefits chimpanzees in the wild. By 17 August, however, not a single lab had applied for an ESA permit. And because the agency needs 90 days or more to review permit requests, no labs will have one by the time the rule goes into effect on 14 September. That means any ongoing projects must stop on that date. \"This is the beginning of the end of invasive chimpanzee research,\" says Stephen Ross, director of the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, who pushed for the FWS rule. Less clear, however, is whether researchers conducting behavioral studies or other non-invasive research involving chimpanzees will need to obtain a permit.\nAuthor: David Grimm",

This column tackles the issue of government red tape, specifically, what portion of a grant is devoted to \"nonresearch\" activities.

One might think that those hunting skills have faded since the advent of agriculture and animal husbandry almost 10,000 years ago. Yet, as Darimont et al. show in a global analysis on page 858 of this issue (1), we are still the unique superpredator that we evolved to be. Analyzing an extensive database of 2135 exploited wild animal populations, the authors find that humans take up to 14 times as much adult prey biomass as do other predators. Our trophic dominance is most pronounced outside our own habitat, in the oceans (see the chart).\nAuthor: Boris Worm",

A striking consequence is that regular matter built from the known particles of the standard model (e.g., quarks, leptons, neutrinos, and photons) accounts for only 4.9% of the total energy-matter density. Most of our universe consists of two components of unknown origin that are colloquially called dark matter (26.8%) and dark energy (68.3%). Two reports in this issue describe experimental efforts in the search for the proposed constituents. On page 849, Hamilton et al.

The consistency and predictability of host-associated microbiomes\u2014like many of the phenotypes of a particular multicellular organism\u2014suggest that they too may, in part, be under the regulation of a genetic blueprint. Indeed, evidence in animals shows that through production of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, the innate immune system shapes the composition of the gut microbiome (3, 4). On page 860 of this issue, Lebeis et al.

It can result in severe liver disease and is the leading cause of liver cancer in many countries. Although directly acting antivirals (DAAs) that target the viral life cycle have created enormous optimism about controlling HCV infection, achieving that goal remains a substantial challenge. Both acute and chronic infections are largely asymptomatic, infection incidence is rising in the United States (2), and comprehensive screening programs are rare in the most highly endemic regions of the world. As a result, less than 5% of the world's HCV-infected population, and only 50% of the United States' HCV-infected population, are aware that they are infected (3, 4) (see the figure). Most of these individuals will not receive treatment and will remain at risk for transmitting the infection to others. Successful control of HCV infection will most likely require a combination of mass global screening to identify those with infection, treatment, and prevention. Prophylactic HCV vaccination would also go a long way to reducing harm for uninfected people who are at risk.\nAuthor: Andrea L. Cox",

Likewise, forest certification systems were created to promote responsible forest management and sustainable practices.

It has been called the \"redwood of the east\" and the \"queen of the conifers.\" A healthy tree resembles an evergreen waterfall; overlapping layers of short, downy needles cascade from the crown almost to the ground. But the iconic tree, found from Georgia to Canada, is under attack. The hemlock woolly adelgid, a tiny sap-sucking insect about the size of a pinhead, has infested more than half of the hemlock's range, killing countless trees. Barring human intervention, it ultimately kills nearly every tree it attacks. Forest managers have been fighting a fierce battle against the adelgid. Many hemlocks are still alive because they've been treated with insecticides. But that's an expensive and labor-intensive tactic, so scientists are searching for more sustainable, long-term strategies. They're rearing and releasing predatory insects that eat the adelgid, for instance, and even looking for rare genes that might help them breed resistant trees. The question is whether such efforts will mature in time to prevent the adelgid from essentially removing one of the defining species from the eastern forest. Eastern hemlocks, warns forester Jesse Webster of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, \"are in intensive care.\"\nAuthor: Gabriel Popkin",

In the vast evergreen forests encircling this small city in Canada's Northwest Territories, years of drought had set the scene for a historic fire year. Across the territories, 3.4 million hectares burned\u2014an area equal to the state of Maryland, and seven times the annual average. The smoke darkened the sky, stung eyes, and filled Yellowknife residents with \"a sense of panic,\" says Frank Lepine, who manages wildfire response for the Northwest Territories government. When the snow fell and the fires died, Lepine's army of firefighters\u2014about 1000 strong at one point\u2014could stand down. But for scientists, the work is just beginning. The fires, they say, were an extreme example of the forces transforming the boreal forest, a stronghold of spruce, pine, and other conifers that rings the top of the planet. With its millions of square kilometers of pristine timber, thick carpet of moss and needles, and organic-rich frozen soil, the boreal forest stores more carbon than any other land ecosystem. And more than any other forest, it is bearing the brunt of climate change, warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet.\nAuthor: Tim Appenzeller",

        "description": "When it came to studying forests, ecologist Robin Chazdon took the road less traveled. In the 1990s, when many tropical researchers were scrambling to study tropical forests before they disappeared, she focused on what grew back once the trees were burned or logged. Many colleagues worked in the forest's shaded understory, an ecosystem celebrated in Hollywood films. She labored in less charismatic deforested plots in the broiling sun, covered head to toe to keep prickly bushes and biting chiggers at bay. For decades, Chazdon worked in relative obscurity on long-term studies of these so-called secondary forests. She took issue with some prevailing views: that tropical forests wouldn't regenerate, and that second growth was a biological wasteland. Chazdon and like-minded colleagues argued that, while protecting intact forest was essential, second growth couldn't be ignored in efforts to protect the environment and human livelihoods. Now the rest of the world is beginning to see her point. Thanks in part to Chazdon's work, many now see secondary forests as key to restoring biodiversity and performing important ecosystems services, such as providing clean water and sequestering carbon. And last year, nations attending a United Nations climate conference set a goal of reforesting 350 million hectares of degraded land\u2014an area larger than India\u2014by 2030.

        "description": "Humans rely on healthy forests to supply energy, building materials, and food and to provide services such as storing carbon, hosting biodiversity, and regulating climate. Defining forest health integrates utilitarian and ecosystem measures of forest condition and function, implemented across a range of spatial scales. Although native forests are adapted to some level of disturbance, all forests now face novel stresses in the form of climate change, air pollution, and invasive pests. Detecting how intensification of these stresses will affect the trajectory of forests is a major scientific challenge that requires developing systems to assess the health of global forests. It is particularly critical to identify thresholds for rapid forest decline, because it can take many decades for forests to restore the services that they provide.\nAuthors: S. Trumbore, P.

        "description": "The boreal forest, one of the largest biomes on Earth, provides ecosystem services that benefit society at levels ranging from local to global. Currently, about two-thirds of the area covered by this biome is under some form of management, mostly for wood production. Services such as climate regulation are also provided by both the unmanaged and managed boreal forests. Although most of the boreal forests have retained the resilience to cope with current disturbances, projected environmental changes of unprecedented speed and amplitude pose a substantial threat to their health. Management options to reduce these threats are available and could be implemented, but economic incentives and a greater focus on the boreal biome in international fora are needed to support further adaptation and mitigation actions.\nAuthors: S.

        "description": "Although disturbances such as fire and native insects can contribute to natural dynamics of forest health, exceptional droughts, directly and in combination with other disturbance factors, are pushing some temperate forests beyond thresholds of sustainability. Interactions from increasing temperatures, drought, native insects and pathogens, and uncharacteristically severe wildfire are resulting in forest mortality beyond the levels of 20th-century experience. Additional anthropogenic stressors, such as atmospheric pollution and invasive species, further weaken trees in some regions. Although continuing climate change will likely drive many areas of temperate forest toward large-scale transformations, management actions can help ease transitions and minimize losses of socially valued ecosystem services.\nAuthors: Constance I.

Planted forests are increasingly threatened by insects and microbial pathogens, which are introduced accidentally and/or have adapted to new host trees. Globalization has hastened tree pest emergence, despite a growing awareness of the problem, improved understanding of the costs, and an increased focus on the importance of quarantine. To protect the value and potential of planted forests, innovative solutions and a better-coordinated global approach are needed. Mitigation strategies that are effective only in wealthy countries fail to contain invasions elsewhere in the world, ultimately leading to global impacts. Solutions to forest pest problems in the future should mainly focus on integrating management approaches globally, rather than single-country strategies. A global strategy to manage pest issues is vitally important and urgently needed.\nAuthors: M. J. Wingfield, E. G. Brockerhoff, B. D. Wingfield, B. Slippers",

Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative \u201cPaleoamerican\u201d relict populations, including the historical Mexican Peric\u00faes and South American Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican Model.\nAuthors: Maanasa Raghavan, Matthias Steinr\u00fccken, Kelley Harris, Stephan Schiffels, Simon Rasmussen, Michael DeGiorgio, Anders Albrechtsen, Cristina Valdiosera, Mar\u00eda C. \u00c1vila-Arcos, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas, Anders Eriksson, Ida Moltke, Mait Metspalu, Julian R.

We experimentally observed this nonergodic evolution for interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasirandom optical lattice and identified the MBL transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder, the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all initial ordering, whereas above a critical disorder strength, a substantial portion of the initial ordering persists. The critical disorder value shows a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Our experiment paves the way to further detailed studies of MBL, such as in noncorrelated disorder or higher dimensions.\nAuthors: Michael Schreiber, Sean S. Hodgman, Pranjal Bordia, Henrik P.

Here, we report the experimental observation of a phase transition of the quantum coherent dynamics of a three-dimensional many-spin system with dipolar interactions. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a solid-state system of spins at room-temperature, we quench the interaction Hamiltonian to drive the evolution of the system. Depending on the quench strength, we then observe either localized or extended dynamics of the system coherence. We extract the critical exponents for the localized cluster size of correlated spins and diffusion coefficient around the phase transition separating the localized from the delocalized dynamical regime.

Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber, we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the field with individual atoms rather than with bulk matter. We thereby constrained a wide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.\nAuthors: P. Hamilton, M. Jaffe, P.

        "description": "Food-web dynamics arise from predator-prey, parasite-host, and herbivore-plant interactions. Models for such interactions include up to three consumer activity states (questing, attacking, consuming) and up to four resource response states (susceptible, exposed, ingested, resistant). Articulating these states into a general model allows for dissecting, comparing, and deriving consumer-resource models. We specify this general model for 11 generic consumer strategies that group mathematically into predators, parasites, and micropredators and then derive conditions for consumer success, including a universal saturating functional response. We further show how to use this framework to create simple models with a common mathematical lineage and transparent assumptions. Underlying assumptions, missing elements, and composite parameters are revealed when classic consumer-resource models are derived from the general model.\nAuthors: Kevin D.

        "description": "Paradigms of sustainable exploitation focus on population dynamics of prey and yields to humanity but ignore the behavior of humans as predators. We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable \u201csuper predator,\u201d which\u2014unless additionally constrained by managers\u2014will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally.\nAuthors: Chris T.

Plant roots grow within extremely diverse soil microbial communities but assemble a taxonomically limited root-associated microbiome. We grew isogenic Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered immune systems in a wild soil and also in recolonization experiments with a synthetic bacterial community. We established that biosynthesis of, and signaling dependent on, the foliar defense phytohormone salicylic acid is required to assemble a normal root microbiome. Salicylic acid modulates colonization of the root by specific bacterial families. Thus, plant immune signaling drives selection from the available microbial communities to sculpt the root microbiome.\nAuthors: Sarah L. Lebeis, Sur Herrera Paredes, Derek S.

        "description": "Elucidating the signaling mechanism of strigolactones has been the key to controlling the devastating problem caused by the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. To overcome the genetic intractability that has previously interfered with identification of the strigolactone receptor, we developed a fluorescence turn-on probe, Yoshimulactone Green (YLG), which activates strigolactone signaling and illuminates signal perception by the strigolactone receptors. Here we describe how strigolactones bind to and act via ShHTLs, the diverged family of \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase-fold proteins in Striga. Live imaging using YLGs revealed that a dynamic wavelike propagation of strigolactone perception wakes up Striga seeds. We conclude that ShHTLs function as the strigolactone receptors mediating seed germination in Striga. Our findings enable access to strigolactone receptors and observation of the regulatory dynamics for strigolactone signal transduction in Striga.\nAuthors: Yuichiro Tsuchiya, Masahiko Yoshimura, Yoshikatsu Sato, Keiko Kuwata, Shigeo Toh, Duncan Holbrook-Smith, Hua Zhang, Peter McCourt, Kenichiro Itami, Toshinori Kinoshita, Shinya Hagihara",

        "description": "Alternative splicing (AS) generates extensive transcriptomic and proteomic complexity. However, the functions of species- and lineage-specific splice variants are largely unknown. Here we show that mammalian-specific skipping of polypyrimidine tract\u2013binding protein 1 (PTBP1) exon 9 alters the splicing regulatory activities of PTBP1 and affects the inclusion levels of numerous exons. During neurogenesis, skipping of exon 9 reduces PTBP1 repressive activity so as to facilitate activation of a brain-specific AS program. Engineered skipping of the orthologous exon in chicken cells induces a large number of mammalian-like AS changes in PTBP1 target exons. These results thus reveal that a single exon-skipping event in an RNA binding regulator directs numerous AS changes between species. Our results further suggest that these changes contributed to evolutionary differences in the formation of vertebrate nervous systems.\nAuthors: Serge Gueroussov, Thomas Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis, Manuel Irimia, Bushra Raj, Zhen-Yuan Lin, Anne-Claude Gingras, Benjamin J.

        "description": "Plasma membrane depolarization can trigger cell proliferation, but how membrane potential influences mitogenic signaling is uncertain. Here, we show that plasma membrane depolarization induces nanoscale reorganization of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate but not other anionic phospholipids. K-Ras, which is targeted to the plasma membrane by electrostatic interactions with phosphatidylserine, in turn undergoes enhanced nanoclustering. Depolarization-induced changes in phosphatidylserine and K-Ras plasma membrane organization occur in fibroblasts, excitable neuroblastoma cells, and Drosophila neurons in vivo and robustly amplify K-Ras\u2013dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Conversely, plasma membrane repolarization disrupts K-Ras nanoclustering and inhibits MAPK signaling. By responding to voltage-induced changes in phosphatidylserine spatiotemporal dynamics, K-Ras nanoclusters set up the plasma membrane as a biological field-effect transistor, allowing membrane potential to control the gain in mitogenic signaling circuits.\nAuthors: Yong Zhou, Ching-On Wong, Kwang-jin Cho, Dharini van der Hoeven, Hong Liang, Dhananiay P.

        "description": "Many transcriptional activators act at a distance from core promoter elements and work by recruiting RNA polymerase through protein-protein interactions. We show here how the prokaryotic regulatory protein CueR both represses and activates transcription by differentially modulating local DNA structure within the promoter. Structural studies reveal that the repressor state slightly bends the promoter DNA, precluding optimal RNA polymerase-promoter recognition. Upon binding a metal ion in the allosteric site, CueR switches into an activator conformation. It maintains all protein-DNA contacts but introduces torsional stresses that kink and undertwist the promoter, stabilizing an A-form DNA\u2013like conformation. These factors switch on and off transcription by exerting dynamic control of DNA stereochemistry, reshaping the core promoter and making it a better or worse substrate for polymerase.\nAuthors: Steven J.

        "description": "Transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) in bacteria requires specific promoter recognition by \u03c3 factors. The major variant \u03c3 factor (\u03c354) initially forms a transcriptionally silent complex requiring specialized adenosine triphosphate\u2013dependent activators for initiation. Our crystal structure of the 450-kilodalton RNAP-\u03c354 holoenzyme at 3.8 angstroms reveals molecular details of \u03c354 and its interactions with RNAP. The structure explains how \u03c354 targets different regions in RNAP to exert its inhibitory function. Although \u03c354 and the major \u03c3 factor, \u03c370, have similar functional domains and contact similar regions of RNAP, unanticipated differences are observed in their domain arrangement and interactions with RNAP, explaining their distinct properties. Furthermore, we observe evolutionarily conserved regulatory hotspots in RNAPs that can be targeted by a diverse range of mechanisms to fine tune transcription.\nAuthors: Yun Yang, Vidya C.
