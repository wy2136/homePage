        "description": "All available evidence suggests that over 60% of new Ph.D.s in science in the United States will not have careers in academic research, yet graduate training in science has followed the same basic format for almost 100 years, heavily focused on producing academic researchers. Given that so many students will not join that community, the system is failing to meet the needs of the majority of its students. Many academic, governmental, and professional leaders and organizations have lamented this disconnect and have suggested worthwhile adjustments, but most of these have been minor changes in graduate course offerings. It is time for the scientific and education communities to take a more fundamental look at how graduate education in science is structured and consider, given the current environment, whether a major reconfiguration of the entire system is needed.\nAuthor: Alan I.

The woman is not cured, stressed the Pasteur Institute's Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, who presented details about the case at an international AIDS conference taking place in Vancouver, Canada, this week: His group found HIV DNA in her blood cells and prodded them to make new copies of the virus. S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n has been following a small cohort of other so-called \"posttreatment controllers,\" but the other all became infected with the virus as adults. He noted that the woman, like other posttreatment controllers, was distinct from the 1% of people known as elite controllers who similarly maintain undetectable plasma levels of HIV without treatment. But the elite controllers, in contrast to posttreatment controllers, keep the virus in check from the earliest days of the infection and have an immune response in many cases that explains how they thwart the virus. The hope is that this new case can help clarify how posttreatment controllers keep the virus in check and then use this information to inform both cure and vaccine research.\nAuthor: Jon Cohen",

If the agreement survives strong opposition in the U.S. Congress, Iran can expect a rapid expansion of scientific cooperation with Western powers. As its nuclear facilities are repurposed, scientists from Iran and abroad will team up in areas such as nuclear fusion, astrophysics, and radioisotopes for cancer therapy. Some scientific activity will take place at the Fordow uranium enrichment facility, which Iran will convert into an international nuclear, physics, and technology center. Russia will help reconfigure 348 centrifuges there to produce stable isotopes for industry. And Fordow may host a small linear accelerator for basic research in nuclear physics and astrophysics. Iran has agreed to invite proposals for collaborative projects at Fordow and hold an international workshop to review them.\nAuthor: Richard Stone",

By sequencing whatever DNA emerges (called eDNA) from even a thimbleful of ancient soil, researchers are reconstructing ancient ecosystems as far back as 700,000 years ago with astonishing clarity. In 2011, they documented that a decline in the big herbivores' favorite foods as the ice age thawed coincided with the animals' disappearance. And a paper this week shows that local extinctions were also tied to bursts of warming. Other eDNA data\u2014in this case from lake sediments\u2014are illuminating how the postglacial thaw transformed other landscapes too, such as temperate forests. Finally, eDNA from Antarctic ice cores promises to reveal what happened in the Southern Hemisphere many thousands of years ago.\nAuthor: Elizabeth Pennisi",

He argued that each element consists of small, highly symmetric corpuscles\u2014the cube for earth, the tetrahedron for fire, the icosahedron for water, and the octahedron for air. The faces of the latter three corpuscles consist of equilateral triangles, which\u2014according to Plato\u2014allows air, water, and fire to interconvert. Plato would likely be thrilled to learn that, as recently confirmed by Huang et al. (1), nanoscale Pt-Ni octahedra are the catalytically most active known material for converting air (molecular oxygen) into water and fire (thermal energy). On page 412 of this issue, Zhang et al. (2) show that octahedral and cubic hollow shells of just a few atomic Pt layers are also versatile catalysts, with the octahedral shells particularly active for oxygen reduction. Such tiny metallic octahedra may one day become the building blocks of electrodes for electrochemical energy conversion.\nAuthor: Peter Strasser",

The human genome encodes ~1500 miRNAs, each with the potential to bind hundreds of different mRNAs (1). miRNAs regulate many biological processes, and the dysregulation of their expression is linked to various human diseases, including cancer (1). To exert their repressive function, miRNAs associate with the Argonaute family of proteins (AGOs) to form the core of miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) (1) (see the figure). In animals, miRISCs silence mRNA expression at two levels, by preventing protein production (translation) and inducing mRNA degradation. Over the past decade, progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanism by which miRISCs induce mRNA degradation, but the question of how miRISCs repress translation remains elusive.\nAuthor: Elisa Izaurralde",

In order to apply them to fold structures such as roofs, solar panels, and space mirrors, for which thickness cannot be disregarded, various methods have been suggested. However, they generally involve adding materials to or offsetting panels away from the idealized sheet without altering the kinematic model used to simulate folding. We develop a comprehensive kinematic synthesis for rigid origami of thick panels that differs from the existing kinematic model but is capable of reproducing motions identical to that of zero-thickness origami. The approach, proven to be effective for typical origami, can be readily applied to fold real engineering structures.\nAuthors: Yan Chen, Rui Peng, Zhong You",

The resulting structure exhibited distinct short- and long-period sheath buckling that occurred reversibly out of phase in the axial and belt directions, enabling a resistance change of less than 5% for a 1000% stretch. By including other rubber and carbon nanotube sheath layers, we demonstrated strain sensors generating an 860% capacitance change and electrically powered torsional muscles operating reversibly by a coupled tension-to-torsion actuation mechanism. Using theory, we quantitatively explain the complementary effects of an increase in muscle length and a large positive Poisson\u2019s ratio on torsional actuation and electronic properties.\nAuthors: Z.

A magnon is a quantum of such collective excitation modes in ordered spin systems. Here, we demonstrate the coherent coupling between a single-magnon excitation in a millimeter-sized ferromagnetic sphere and a superconducting qubit, with the interaction mediated by the virtual photon excitation in a microwave cavity. We obtain the coupling strength far exceeding the damping rates, thus bringing the hybrid system into the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we use a parametric drive to realize a tunable magnon-qubit coupling scheme. Our approach provides a versatile tool for quantum control and measurement of the magnon excitations and may lead to advances in quantum information processing.\nAuthors: Yutaka Tabuchi, Seiichiro Ishino, Atsushi Noguchi, Toyofumi Ishikawa, Rekishu Yamazaki, Koji Usami, Yasunobu Nakamura",

To combine these resources, it is desirable to achieve the coherent coupling of a single spin to photons stored in a superconducting resonator. Using a circuit design based on a nanoscale spin valve, we coherently hybridize the individual spin and charge states of a double quantum dot while preserving spin coherence. This scheme allows us to achieve spin-photon coupling up to the megahertz range at the single-spin level. The cooperativity is found to reach 2.3, and the spin coherence time is about 60 nanoseconds. We thereby demonstrate a mesoscopic device suitable for nondestructive spin readout and distant spin coupling.\nAuthors: J. J. Viennot, M. C. Dartiailh, A. Cottet, T. Kontos",

Density functional theory calculations suggest that the etching is initiated via a mechanism that involves the formation of vacancies through the removal of Pd atoms incorporated into the outermost layer during the deposition of Pt. With the use of Pd nanoscale cubes and octahedra as templates, we obtained Pt cubic and octahedral nanocages enclosed by {100} and {111} facets, respectively, which exhibited distinctive catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction.\nAuthors: Lei Zhang, Luke T.

The discovery of snakes with two legs has shed light on the transition from lizards to snakes, but no snake has been described with four limbs, and the ecology of early snakes is poorly known. We describe a four-limbed snake from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) Crato Formation of Brazil. The snake has a serpentiform body plan with an elongate trunk, short tail, and large ventral scales suggesting characteristic serpentine locomotion, yet retains small prehensile limbs. Skull and body proportions as well as reduced neural spines indicate fossorial adaptation, suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing rather than marine ancestors. Hooked teeth, an intramandibular joint, a flexible spine capable of constricting prey, and the presence of vertebrate remains in the guts indicate that this species preyed on vertebrates and that snakes made the transition to carnivory early in their history. The structure of the limbs suggests that they were adapted for grasping, either to seize prey or as claspers during mating. Together with a diverse fauna of basal snakes from the Cretaceous of South America, Africa, and India, this snake suggests that crown Serpentes originated in Gondwana.\nAuthors: David M.

Here we provide evidence for the existence of microbial communities in ~40\u00b0 to 60\u00b0C sediment associated with lignite coal beds at ~1.5 to 2.5 km below the seafloor in the Pacific Ocean off Japan. Microbial methanogenesis was indicated by the isotopic compositions of methane and carbon dioxide, biomarkers, cultivation data, and gas compositions. Concentrations of indigenous microbial cells below 1.5 km ranged from &lt;10 to ~104 cells cm\u22123. Peak concentrations occurred in lignite layers, where communities differed markedly from shallower subseafloor communities and instead resembled organotrophic communities in forest soils. This suggests that terrigenous sediments retain indigenous community members tens of millions of years after burial in the seabed.\nAuthors: F. Inagaki, K.-U. Hinrichs, Y. Kubo, M. W. Bowles, V. B.

Disruption of experience during a critical period produces neurons that lack specificity for particular stimulus features, such as location in the somatosensory system. Synaptic plasticity is the agent by which sensory experience affects cortical development. Here, we describe, in mice, a developmental critical period that affects plasticity itself. Transient neonatal disruption of signaling via the C-terminal domain of \u201cdisrupted in schizophrenia 1\u201d (DISC1)\u2014a molecule implicated in psychiatric disorders\u2014resulted in a lack of long-term potentiation (LTP) (persistent strengthening of synapses) and experience-dependent potentiation in adulthood. Long-term depression (LTD) (selective weakening of specific sets of synapses) and reversal of LTD were present, although impaired, in adolescence and absent in adulthood. These changes may form the basis for the cognitive deficits associated with mutations in DISC1 and the delayed onset of a range of psychiatric symptoms in late adolescence.\nAuthors: Stuart D.

We found that two similar ER integral membrane proteins, oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)\u2013related protein 5 (ORP5) and ORP8, tethered the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) via the interaction of their pleckstrin homology domains with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in this membrane. Their OSBP-related domains (ORDs) harbored either PI4P or phosphatidylserine (PS) and exchanged these lipids between bilayers. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that ORP5 and ORP8 could mediate PI4P/PS countertransport between the ER and the PM, thus delivering PI4P to the ER-localized PI4P phosphatase Sac1 for degradation and PS from the ER to the PM. This exchange helps to control plasma membrane PI4P levels and selectively enrich PS in the PM.\nAuthors: Jeeyun Chung, Federico Torta, Kaori Masai, Louise Lucast, Heather Czapla, Lukas B.

        "description": "In eukaryotic cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but is highly enriched in the plasma membrane (PM), where it contributes negative charge and to specific recruitment of signaling proteins. This distribution relies on transport mechanisms whose nature remains elusive. Here, we found that the PS transporter Osh6p extracted phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and exchanged PS for PI4P between two membranes. We solved the crystal structure of Osh6p:PI4P complex and demonstrated that the transport of PS by Osh6p depends on PI4P recognition in vivo. Finally, we showed that the PI4P-phosphatase Sac1p, by maintaining a PI4P gradient at the ER/PM interface, drove PS transport. Thus, PS transport by oxysterol-binding protein\u2013related protein (ORP)/oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins is fueled by PI4P metabolism through PS/PI4P exchange cycles.\nAuthors: Joachim Moser von Filseck, Alenka \u010copi\u010d, Vanessa Delfosse, Stefano Vanni, Catherine L.

        "description": "Mutations in the LRBA gene (encoding the lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein) cause a syndrome of autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and humoral immune deficiency. The biological role of LRBA in immunologic disease is unknown. We found that patients with LRBA deficiency manifested a dramatic and sustained improvement in response to abatacept, a CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4)\u2013immunoglobulin fusion drug. Clinical responses and homology of LRBA to proteins controlling intracellular trafficking led us to hypothesize that it regulates CTLA4, a potent inhibitory immune receptor. We found that LRBA colocalized with CTLA4 in endosomal vesicles and that LRBA deficiency or knockdown increased CTLA4 turnover, which resulted in reduced levels of CTLA4 protein in FoxP3+ regulatory and activated conventional T cells. In LRBA-deficient cells, inhibition of lysosome degradation with chloroquine prevented CTLA4 loss. These findings elucidate a mechanism for CTLA4 trafficking and control of immune responses and suggest therapies for diseases involving the CTLA4 pathway.\nAuthors: Bernice Lo, Kejian Zhang, Wei Lu, Lixin Zheng, Qian Zhang, Chrysi Kanellopoulou, Yu Zhang, Zhiduo Liu, Jill M.

        "description": "Superresolution microscopy has recently been making headlines again, not least because it was the breakthrough that spurred Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell, and William Moerner to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2014. The number of superresolution technologies keeps increasing, along with an alphabet soup of acronyms that includes SIM, SPIM, STED, PALM, and STORM. It is difficult enough for the microscopy experts to keep up, but even more challenging for the average biologist, particularly when they are looking for more from their data than a standard or confocal microscope can offer. When faced with the array of possible techniques, how does one decide which technique is going to get the results needed for that next major publication? In this webinar we will discuss the newest developments in superresolution microscopy and provide practical advice on obtaining the best imaging results. Our panelists, including 2014 Nobel Prize winner Eric Betzig, will help you find the right tool to answer your biological question. You will also hear case studies about how superresolution microscopy data has made the difference between acceptance and rejection of key papers by scientific journals.View the Webinar\nAuthors: Eric Betzig, Raman Das, Justin Taraska",
