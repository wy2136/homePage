This study analyzed the wetlands in Shanghai, a province-level city, using remote sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques based on the Chinese national wetland inventory procedure and standards. FORMOSAT imagery acquired in 2012 and Navy nautical charts of the Yangtze estuarine area were used in conjunction with object-oriented segmentation, expert interpretation, and field validation to determine wetland status. Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2013 as well as social-economic data collected from 1985 to 2013 were used to further assess wetland changes. In 2013, Shanghai contained 376970.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha of wetlands, and 78.8% of all wetlands were in marine or estuarine systems. Estuarine waters comprised the single largest wetland category. Between the first national wetland inventory in 2003 and the second national wetland inventory in 2013, Shanghai lost 50519.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha of wetlands, amounting to a mean annual loss rate of 1.2% or an 11.8% loss over the decade. Declines were proportionately higher in marine and estuarine wetlands, with an annual loss of 1.8%, while there was a sharp increase of 1882.6% in constructed water storage areas for human uses. Diking, filling, impoundment and reclamation, which are all attributable to the economic development and urbanization associated with population increases, were the major factors that explained the gain and loss of wetlands. Additional factors affecting wetland losses and gains include sediment trapping by the hydropower system, which reduces supply to the estuary and erodes wetlands, and sediment trapping by the jetties, spur dikes, and diversion bulwark associated with a navigation channel deepening project, which has the converse effect, increasing saltmarsh wetland area at Jiuduansha shoal by three times between 2000 and 2013.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Given the context of climate change, where alterations to seasonal snow patterns are anticipated, and the often-strong coupling between recharge and discharge in karst aquifers, this research area is of great importance. Therefore, we investigated how snowmelt water transits through the vadose and phreatic zone of a karst aquifer. This was accomplished by evaluating the relationships between meteorological data, soil\u2013water content, vadose zone flow in a cave 53<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m below ground and aquifer discharge. Time series data indicate that the quantity and duration of meltwater input at the soil surface influences flow and storage within the soil and epikarst. Prolonged periods of snowmelt promote perched storage in surficial soils and encourage surficial, lateral flow to preferential flow paths. Thus, in karstic watersheds overlain by crystalline loess, a typical pedologic and lithologic pairing in central Europe and parts of North America, soils can serve as the dominant mechanism impeding infiltration and promoting shallow lateral flow. Further, hydrograph analysis of vadose zone flow and aquifer discharge, suggests that storage associated with shallow soils is the dominant source of discharge at time scales of up to several weeks after melt events, while phreatic storage becomes import during prolonged periods without input. Soils can moderate karst aquifer dynamics and play a more governing role on karst aquifer storage and discharge than previously credited. Overall, this signifies that a fundamental understanding of soil structure and distribution is critical when assessing recharge to karstic aquifers, particularly in cold regions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

There has been considerable interest in the application of integrated process-based hydrologic models in recent years. While the models have been applied to address questions of water quantity and to better understand linkages between hydrology and land surface processes, routine applications of these models to address water quality issues are currently limited. In this paper, we first describe a general process-based watershed-scale solute transport modeling framework, based on an operator splitting strategy and a Lagrangian particle transport method combined with dispersion and reactions. The transport and the hydrologic modules are tightly coupled and the interactions among different hydrologic components are explicitly modeled. We test transport modules using data from plot-scale experiments and available analytical solutions for different hydrologic domains. The numerical solutions are also compared with an analytical solution for groundwater transit times with interactions between surface and subsurface flows. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the model to simulate bacterial fate and transport in the Red Cedar River watershed in Michigan and test hypotheses about sources and transport pathways. The watershed bacterial fate and transport model is expected to be useful for making near real-time predictions at marine and freshwater beaches.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

While research has brought forth various approaches for inferring or transferring tuneable model parameters from gauged and calibrated catchments, it has also been recently shown that a few short measurements can support predictions in an ungauged basin by constraining the acceptable range of the parameters. For the present study, we examined a combination of both parameter regionalisation and short-term runoff measurements. More precisely, we attempted to select complete parameter sets from a range of calibrated catchments using a few measurements. Then, we tested a number of ways to combine the hydrographs simulated with these parameter sets with those simulated using a well-established Nearest Neighbour scheme, in order to make use of both actually measured runoff data as well as hydrological similarity. The experimental basis for our study were 49 representative catchments in Switzerland which have been successfully calibrated and regionalised with the hydrological modelling system PREVAH. Results show that even a few short measurements during mean runoff conditions can lead to models that are more efficient than those achieved with hydrological similarity alone. The possible improvement depends largely on the regime type of the catchment examined. Also, the most suitable season to perform measurements varies: In catchments dominated by snow melt or ice melt or both, considerable improvements can be achieved with as few as two measurements during spring or summer, whereas rainfall-dominated catchments show only moderate improvements with no particular season being more suitable for the measurements. Our findings highlight the value of field measurements in mountain areas. The information gained in these regions from short measurements may act as a counterbalance to the sparse operational observation networks.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Nevertheless modelling spatially-distributed hydrological processes can be challenging, particularly in strongly heterogeneous urbanized areas. Multiple interactions occur between urban structures and the water system at various temporal and spatial scales. So far, no universal methodology exists for simulating the urban water system at catchment scale. This paper reviews the state of the art on the scientific knowledge and practice of modelling the urban hydrological system at the catchment scale, with the purpose of identifying current limitations and defining a blueprint for future modelling advances.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">We compare conceptual descriptions of urban physical hydrological processes on basis of a selection of 43 modelling approaches. The complexity of the urban water system at the catchment scale results in an incomplete understanding of the interaction between urban and natural hydrological systems, and in a high degree of uncertainty. Data availability is still a strong limitation since current modelling practice recognizes the need for high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal gaps exist between the physical scales of hydrological processes and the resolution of applied models. Therefore urban hydrology is often simplified either as a study of surface runoff over impervious surfaces or hydraulics of piped systems. Many approaches target very specific objectives and the level of detail in representing physical processes is not consistent. Based on our analysis, we propose a blueprint for a highly complex integrated urban hydrological model. We regard flexibility, in terms of model structure and data assimilation, as the key characteristic for overcoming these limitations. We advocate the use of modular, process-based approaches, which are flexible and adaptable to research needs. Higher complexity is inevitable, and higher uncertainty is a major consequence. Remote sensing data, measurable model parameters and new spatially-distributed calibration techniques might help to reduce uncertainties.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The drainage performance of the resulting system varies spatially and complicates runoff and nutrient load generation within the fields. We presented a method to estimate the drainage performance of a heterogeneous subsurface drainage system by simulating the area with the three-dimensional hydrological FLUSH model. A GIS analysis was used to delineate the surface runoff contributing area in the field. We applied the method to reproduce the water balance and to investigate the effectiveness of a subsurface drainage network of a clayey field located in southern Finland. The subsurface drainage system was originally installed in the area in 1971 and the drainage efficiency was improved in 1995 and 2005 by installing new drains. FLUSH was calibrated against total runoff and drain discharge data from 2010 to 2011 and validated against total runoff in 2012. The model supported quantification of runoff fractions via the three installed drainage networks. Model realisations were produced to investigate the extent of the runoff contributing areas and the effect of the drainage parameters on subsurface drain discharge. The analysis showed that better model performance was achieved when the efficiency of the oldest drainage network (installed in 1971) was decreased. Our analysis method can reveal the drainage system performance but not the reason for the deterioration of the drainage performance. Tillage layer runoff from the field was originally computed by subtracting drain discharge from the total runoff. The drains installed in 1995 bypass the measurement system, which renders the tillage layer runoff calculation procedure invalid after 1995. Therefore, this article suggests use of a local correction coefficient based on the simulations for further research utilizing data from the study area.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The objectives of the study were: first, to establish a conceptual hydrogeological model of the karst groundwater system; second, to estimate the proportion of extra glacier melt water infiltrating the karst aquifer that is being induced by the regional climate warming; third, to calculate the karst-related flux of carbon into the karst aquifer. Knowledge of the local hydrogeological background from previous work was the starting point of the hydrochemical and stable isotopic study. Some representative spring waters and recharge waters (i.e. glacier melt water and rainwater) were investigated both spatially and temporally by hydrochemical and isotopic techniques, including analysis of major and some minor ions and O and H stable isotopes. A conceptual hydrogeological model of a fracture-diffuse flow karst groundwater aquifer was proposed.

This is particularly true in water resource studies that depend on model-based assessments of alternative management strategies. In recent decades, Bayesian data assimilation methods have been widely used in hydrology to assess uncertain model parameters and predictions. In this case study, a particular data assimilation algorithm, the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA) (Emerick and Reynolds, 2012), is used to derive posterior samples of uncertain model parameters and forecasts for a distributed hydrological model of Yanqi basin, China. This model is constructed using MIKESHE/MIKE11software, which provides for coupling between surface and subsurface processes (<cross-refs refid=\"b0060 b0065 b0070 b0075\" id=\"r8005\">DHI, 2011a\u2013d</cross-refs>). The random samples in the posterior parameter ensemble are obtained by using measurements to update 50 prior parameter samples generated with a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) procedure. The posterior forecast samples are obtained from model runs that use the corresponding posterior parameter samples. Two iterative sample update methods are considered: one based on an a perturbed observation Kalman filter update and one based on a square root Kalman filter update. These alternatives give nearly the same results and converge in only two iterations. The uncertain parameters considered include hydraulic conductivities, drainage and river leakage factors, van Genuchten soil property parameters, and dispersion coefficients. The results show that the uncertainty in many of the parameters is reduced during the smoother updating process, reflecting information obtained from the observations. Some of the parameters are insensitive and do not benefit from measurement information. The correlation coefficients among certain parameters increase in each iteration, although they generally stay below 0.50.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Previous studies of freshwater lenses have mainly focused on interface geometries, disregarding flow patterns within the lens. In this study we use physical, analytical and numerical modeling to investigate the influence of vertically and horizontally layered aquifers and variations in recharge on the age stratification, travel times and transient development of freshwater lenses. Four generalized settings were examined in detail on a laboratory-scale. The experiments show significant deviations from homogeneous models. The case of a high permeability layer underlying a layer of lower permeability shows the strongest deviations in the processes investigated here. Water in the more permeable lower layer overtakes water flowing only through the upper layer, causing a bimodal distribution of travel times and a vertical repeating of the age stratification near the coast. The effects of heterogeneities revealed by the physical model experiments are expected to also occur on real islands and have thus to be considered when developing conceptual models for the management of such freshwater lenses.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Classically, channel geometry is defined using data, yet at larger scales the necessary information and model structures do not exist to take this approach. We therefore propose a fundamentally different approach where the structural uncertainty in channel geometry is represented using a simple parameterisation, which could then be estimated through calibration or data assimilation. This paper first outlines the development of a computationally efficient numerical scheme to represent generalised channel shapes using a single parameter, which is then validated using a simple straight channel test case and shown to predict wetted perimeter to within 2% for the channels tested. An application to the River Severn, UK is also presented, along with an analysis of model sensitivity to channel shape, depth and friction. The channel shape parameter was shown to improve model simulations of river level, particularly for more physically plausible channel roughness and depth parameter ranges. Calibrating channel Manning\u2019s coefficient in a rectangular channel provided similar water level simulation accuracy in terms of Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency to a model where friction and shape or depth were calibrated. However, the calibrated Manning coefficient in the rectangular channel model was \u223c2/3 greater than the likely physically realistic value for this reach and this erroneously slowed wave propagation times through the reach by several hours. Therefore, for large scale models applied in data sparse areas, calibrating channel depth and/or shape may be preferable to assuming a rectangular geometry and calibrating friction alone.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, runoff projections are affected by uncertainties in the modelling process that limit their utility to decision makers. The main source of uncertainty in runoff projections are the Global Climate Models (GCMs) used to produce future climate projections. The impact on projected runoff of this uncertainty has mainly been assessed through comparison of multi-model runs of future climate with little exploration of uncertainties inside the models due to different parameterisations. Here we investigate the uncertainty response of projected runoff due to perturbed physics parameter variations within a GCM using a novel 2500 member ensemble from the HadCM3L model. Our research evaluates the uncertainties in runoff modelling for southwest Western Australia, a Mediterranean climate region which has experienced reductions in precipitation during the last decades. Results for future projections in southwest Western Australian catchments indicate reductions in modelled precipitation between 0% and 40% and increases in temperature that fluctuate between 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C and 3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C by 2050\u20132080 compared to 1970\u20132000, which lead to reductions in projected runoff of between 10% and 80%. This range of uncertainty for projected runoff is larger than that calculated for previous estimates of within-model uncertainties of runoff. The perturbed physics approach indicates that current water management assessments underestimate uncertainties in runoff projections.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Further, several approaches are presented in this study to evaluate the efficiency of WRF simulated soil moisture for SMD estimation and compared against Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) downscaled and non-downscaled soil moisture.

Community-led watershed-based nutrient reduction planning has been promoted as a strategy for water quality restoration and initial nitrate load criteria have been proposed for the impacted estuaries. An integrated modeling approach was developed to predict base flow nitrate loads to inform the planning activities in the groundwater-dominated agricultural watersheds. Nitrate load is calculated as base flow multiplied by the average of nitrate concentration at the receiving watershed outlet. The average of nitrate concentration is estimated as the integration of nitrate leaching concentration over the watershed area minus a nitrate loss coefficient that accounts for long-term nitrate storage in the aquifer and losses from the recharge to the discharge zones. Nitrate leaching concentrations from potato rotation systems were estimated with a LEACHN model and the land use areas were determined from satellite image data (2006\u20132009) using GIS. The simulated average nitrate concentrations are compared with the arithmetic average of nitrate concentration measurements in each of the 27 watersheds for model calibration and in 138 watersheds for model verifications during 2006\u20132009. Sensitivity of the model to the variations of land use mapping errors, nitrate leaching concentrations from key sources, and nitrate loss coefficient was tested. The calibration and verification statistics and sensitivity analysis show that the model can provide accurate nitrate concentration predictions for watersheds with drainage areas more than 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and nitrate concentration over 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>, while the model resolution for watersheds with drainage areas below 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and/or nitrate concentration below 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> may not be sufficient for nitrate load management purposes. Comparisons of normalized daily stream discharges among the active hydrometric stations indicated that stream base flow could be prorated for nitrate load calculation from the nearest gauging station in the absence of discharge measurements. Annual nitrate losses, including aquifer long-term storage, denitrification, and riparian plant uptake were estimated to be 0.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>L<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>, corresponding to 3.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>.

From among the 75 watersheds selected for model verification, the maximum and median base flow nitrate loads to the estuaries were estimated to be 29 and 5.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> respectively with RMSE as 2.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>kg<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>N<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>. At the estuaries with nitrate loads above the medians, the predominant nitrate sources (75\u201398%) were derived from the potato rotation lands, highlighting the importance of N use management with potato production for water quality restoration; nitrate load derived from atmospheric N deposits was estimated to account for 3.6\u201313% of annual nitrate loads in watersheds with nitrate loads exceeding the median values. The application of the model to nutrient reduction planning in the Southwest River watershed implies that a significant change on cropping practices has to be made in order to mitigate the anoxic events in this highly impacted agricultural watershed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

While GIWs are therefore spatially isolated, field-based studies have observed a continuum of hydrologic connections between these systems and other surface waters. Yet few studies have quantified the watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on downstream hydrology. Further, existing modeling approaches to evaluate GIW effects at a watershed scale have utilized conceptual or spatially disaggregated wetland representations. Working towards wetland model representations that use spatially explicit approaches may improve current scientific understanding concerning GIW effects on the downstream hydrograph. The objective of this study was to quantify the watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on downstream hydrology while emphasizing a spatially explicit representation of GIWs and GIW connectivity relationships. We constructed a hydrologic model for a \u223c202<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> watershed in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, a watershed with a substantial population of GIWs, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We applied a novel representation of GIWs within the model, facilitated by an alternative hydrologic response unit (HRU) definition and modifications to the SWAT source code that extended the model\u2019s \u201cpothole\u201d representation. We then executed a series of scenarios to assess the downstream hydrologic effect of various distributions of GIWs within the watershed. Results suggest that: (1) GIWs have seasonally dependent effects on baseflow; (2) GIWs mitigate peak flows; and (3) The presence of GIWs on the landscape impacts the watershed water balance. This work demonstrates a means of GIW simulation with improved spatial detail while showing that GIWs, in-aggregate, have a substantial effect on downstream hydrology in the studied watershed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This paper investigates the temporal changes of the hydraulic conductivities of the rocks and engineered structures via a thorough analysis of hydrological data collected at the Dokam Dam, Iraq, and a numerical model that simulates the Darcian component of the seepage. Analysis of the data indicates increased seepage with time and suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of the rocks increased as the conductivity of the grout curtain decreased. Conductivity changes on the order of 10<sup loc=\"post\">\u22128</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m/s, in a 20-yr period were quantified using the numerical analysis. It is postulated that the changes in hydraulic properties in the vicinity of Dokan Dam are due to suspension of fine materials, interbedded in small fissures in the rocks, and re-settlement of these materials along the curtain. Consequently, the importance of the grout curtain to minimize the downstream seepage, not only as a result of the conductivity contrast with the rocks, but also as a barrier to suspended clay sediments, is demonstrated. The numerical analysis also helped us to estimate the proportion of the disconnected karstic conduit flow to the overall flow.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, because of its nonlinearity, prediction of daily rainfall with high accuracy and long prediction lead time is difficult. There are many daily rainfall prediction methods in the literature, but they are known to yield inaccurate predictions with short lead time, require many physical parameters and involve complicated mathematical equations with huge computational burden. Recently, artificial neural network has been used for predicting rainfall with the objective of addressing the above mentioned problems. But still, the accuracy has not been satisfactory and predictions are with short lead time. In this study, two methods called combined season-multilayer perceptron (SAS-MP) and hybrid wavelet-season-multilayer perceptron (W-SAS-MP) were developed to enhance prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time of daily rainfall up to 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days by using data from two stations in Turkey. These two models were compared with the stand-alone multilayer perceptron and another most commonly used method called combined wavelet-multilayer perceptron (W-MP). The performances of the models were evaluated by using coefficient of determination, coefficient of efficiency and root mean squared error. The SAS-MP model was found to be better than W-MP in most cases, except lead time day 1, where W-MP performed better. Throughout all the lead times, however, the hybrid W-SAS-MP model performed best with CE values of 0.911 and 0.909, respectively, for prediction lead time of 1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day and 0.588 and 0.570, respectively, for prediction lead time of 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days at Stations 17836 and 17837, respectively, at the model testing (validation) phase. Therefore, W-SAS-MP can be an appropriate tool for enhancing daily rainfall prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The electromagnetic induction (EMI) method is one of the geophysical techniques potentially useful in this regard. Indeed, it does not require contact with the ground, it allows a relatively fast survey of hillslope, it gives information related to soil depth greater than few centimetres and it can also be used in wooded areas. In this study, apparent electrical conductivity (EC<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf>) and soil moisture (SM) measurements were jointly carried out by using a multi-frequency EMI sensor (GEM-300) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes, respectively. The aim was to retrieve SM variations at the hillslope scale over four sites, characterized by different land-soil units, located in a small mountainous catchment in southern Italy. Repeated measurements of EC<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf> carried out over a fixed point showed that the signal variability of the GEM-300 sensor (Std. Err. \u223c[0.02\u20130.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mS/m]) was negligible. The correlation estimated between point EC<inf loc=\"post\">a</inf> and SM, measured with both portable and buried TDR probes, varied between 0.24 and 0.58, depending on the site considered. In order to reduce the effect of small-scale variability, a spatial smoothing filter was applied which allowed the estimation of linear relationships with higher coefficient of correlation (<italic>r</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u223c<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.46\u20130.8).

Single-porosity numerical models often give satisfactory results for simulating flow. However, simulating transport is more challenging and results based on single-porosity assumptions can yield inaccurate results. Seven cases are reviewed where travel times were found to be unexpectedly short. Results show that dual-porosity flow is common, with advective flow through fracture networks and immobile storage in the matrix. However, in some cases a dual- or multiple-permeability (or porosity) approach provides better simulations of aquifer behavior. Fracture porosity of bedrock aquifers is usually &amp;lt;1%, resulting in rapid groundwater velocities in many aquifers. Overestimation of the effective porosity is the most common reason for the overestimation of travel times. Residence times of artificial tracers in bedrock aquifers are typically two to three orders of magnitude less than residence times of environmental tracers because the latter are retarded by matrix diffusion.

The approach involves identification of a separate set of attributes corresponding to each of the sites (being considered in the study area/region) in a recursive manner according to their importance, and utilizing those attributes to construct effective regional regression relationships to estimate statistical raw moments (SMs) of peak flows. The SMs are then utilized to arrive at parameters of flood frequency distribution and quantile estimate(s) corresponding to target return period(s). Effectiveness of the RMS approach in arriving at flood quantile estimates for ungauged sites is demonstrated through leave-one-out cross-validation experiment on watersheds in Indiana State, USA.

A decomposition method is adopted by separating the original problem into a linear diffusion equation (DE) and two correction functions. The linear DE satisfies all the initial and boundary conditions, reflecting the basic characteristics of groundwater movement. The correction functions quantitatively measure the errors due to the degeneration from the original BEQ to a linear DE. As the correction functions must be linearized to obtain analytical solution forms, the proposed method is an approximate approach. In the case studies, we apply this method to four different situations of water level variation (i.e., constant, sudden, linear and periodic change) resting on vertical or sloping boundaries.

The goal of the study was to analyze the impact of these changes on the magnitude and timing of winter maximum daily flows. Hydrologic series for seventeen tributaries of the St. Lawrence River were analyzed over the period from 1934 to 2010. The most noteworthy result, obtained using the Lombard method, was to highlight a nearly generalized shift in mean values of the series in the early 1970s. This shift reflects a significant increase in the magnitude of winter maximum daily flows after that decade, interpreted to result primarily from snowmelt, which is increasingly frequent at the end of winter. The frequency of the dates of occurrence of winter maximum daily flows increased significantly during the last winter decade (ten days) after the 1970s for most rivers in southern Quebec. The copula method did not, however, reveal any significant change in the dependency between the timing and magnitude of winter maximum daily flows over time. Finally, canonical correlation analysis revealed that the magnitude of winter maximum daily flows is positively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while their dates of occurrence are correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We applied Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess the effects of potential land use change and climate variability on hydrologic processes of large agriculture dominated Big Sioux River (BSR) watershed located in North Central region of USA. Future climate change scenarios were simulated using average output of temperature and precipitation data derived from Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (B1, A1B, and A2) for end-21st century. Land use change was modeled spatially based on historic long-term pattern of agricultural transformation in the basin, and included the expansion of corn (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) cultivation by 2, 5, and 10%. We estimated higher surface runoff in all land use scenarios with maximum increase of 4% while expanding 10% corn cultivation in the basin. Annual stream discharge was estimated higher with maximum increase of 72% in SRES-B1 attributed from higher groundwater contribution of 152% in the same scenario. We assessed increased precipitation during spring season but the summer precipitation decreased substantially in all climate change scenarios. Similar to decreased summer precipitation, discharge of the BSR also decreased potentially affecting agricultural production due to reduced future water availability during crop growing season in the basin. However, combined effects of potential land use change with climate variability enhanced for higher annual discharge of the BSR. Therefore, these estimations can be crucial for implications of future land use planning and water resources management of the basin.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Formal Bayesian approaches are commonly employed for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis, but are often criticized for making strong assumptions about the nature of model residuals via the likelihood function that may not be well satisfied (or even checked). This technical note outlines a residual error model (likelihood function) specification framework that aims to provide guidance for the application of more appropriate residual error models through a nested approach that is both flexible and extendible. The framework synthesizes many previously employed residual error models and has been applied to four synthetic datasets (of differing error structure) and a real dataset from the Black River catchment in Queensland, Australia. Each residual error model was investigated and assessed under a top-down approach focused on its ability to properly characterize the errors.

The HBMA is an ensemble method for prediction and is used to segregate the sources of model structure uncertainty in ANNs and investigate their variance contributions to total prediction variance. Specific sources of uncertainty considered in ANNs include the uncertainty in neural network weights and biases (model parameters), uncertainty of selecting an activation function for the hidden layer, and uncertainty of selecting a number of hidden layer nodes (model structure). Prediction uncertainties due to uncertain inputs and ANN model parameters are represented by within-model variance. Prediction uncertainties due to uncertain activation function and uncertain number of nodes for the hidden layer are represented by between-model variance. The method is demonstrated through a study that employs ANNs to predict fluoride concentration in the aquifers of the Maku area, Azarbaijan, Iran.

Their initiation in unsaturated soils is regulated by rainfall infiltration which reduces the matric suction and hence shear strength. Analysis of such phenomena is of strategic importance especially when it aims to mitigate landslide risk by means of early warning systems (EWSs). In this framework, physically-based models need to reproduce the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the slopes through numerical analyses, whose main uncertainty concerns the hydraulic conditions at the boundaries of the studied domain and hydraulic conductivity functions of unsaturated soils. Hence consummate knowledge of both these factors is absolutely necessary for efficient predictions. In this paper hydraulic boundary conditions and hydraulic conductivity functions are investigated at the scale of the slope through an application of soil water balance based on in-situ monitoring at the test site of Monteforte Irpino (southern Italy). Meteorological data, matric suction and soil water content measurements were collected over four years at the test site. The soil water balance was analysed on a seasonal time scale with regard to the whole pyroclastic cover resting on the steep limestone substratum. Infiltration and runoff are estimated, interaction between the soil cover and the substratum is investigated, and the hydraulic conductivity functions operative at the site scale are defined.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Incorporation of uncertainty assessment within hydrological models can facilitate the calibration process and improve the degree of credibility to the subsequent prediction. In this study, an inexact-variance hydrological modeling system (IVHMS) is developed for assessing parameter uncertainty on modeling outputs in the Kaidu River Basin, China. Through incorporating the techniques of type-2 fuzzy analysis (T2FA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) within the semi-distributed land use based runoff processes (SLURP) model, IVHMS can quantitatively evaluate the individual and interactive effects of multiple uncertain parameters expressed as type-2 fuzzy sets in the hydrological modeling system. The modeling outputs indicate a good performance of SLURP model in describing the daily streamflow at the Dashankou hydrological station. Uncertainty analysis is conducted through sampling from fuzzy membership functions under different \u03b1-cut levels. The results show that, under a lower degree of plausibility (i.e. a lower \u03b1-cut level), intervals for peak and average flows are both wider; while intervals of peak and average flows become narrower under a higher degree of plausibility. Results based on ANOVA reveal that (i) precipitation factor (PF), one of main factors dominating the runoff processes, should be paid more attention in order to enhance the model performance; (ii) retention constant for fast store (RS) controls the amount and timing of the outflow from saturated zone and has a highly nonlinear effect on the average flow; (iii) the interaction between retention constant for fast store (RF) and maximum capacity for fast store (MF) has statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) effect on modeling outputs through affecting the maximum water holding capacity and the soil infiltration rate.

In this study, the uncertainties around impact projections from several sources (climate models, natural variability of the weather, hydrological model calibration) are calculated and compared for the Geer catchment (465<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>) in Belgium. We use a surface\u2013subsurface integrated model implemented using the finite element code HydroGeoSphere, coupled with climate change scenarios (2010\u20132085) and the UCODE_2005 inverse model, to assess the uncertainty related to the calibration of the hydrological model. This integrated model provides a more realistic representation of the water exchanges between surface and subsurface domains and constrains more the calibration with the use of both surface and subsurface observed data. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were performed on predictions. The linear uncertainty analysis is approximate for this nonlinear system, but it provides some measure of uncertainty for computationally demanding models. Results show that, for the Geer catchment, the most important uncertainty is related to calibration of the hydrological model. The total uncertainty associated with the prediction of groundwater levels remains large.

Although prediction of the SWRC and SHC from available parameters, such as textural data, organic matter, and bulk density have been under investigation for decades, up to now no research has focused on the effect of sample dimensions on the soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions development. The main purpose here is investigating sample internal diameter and height (or length) effects on the prediction of the soil water retention curve and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. We, therefore, develop pedotransfer functions using a novel approach called contrast pattern aided regression (CPXR) and consider the sample dimensions as input variables. Two datasets including 210 and 213 soil samples with known sample dimensions were extracted from the UNSODA database to develop and evaluate pedotransfer functions for the SWRC and SHC, respectively. The 10-fold cross-validation method is applied to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed regression-based models.

Contributions of phosphorus from groundwater have typically been assumed minor, though elevated concentrations have been associated with riparian areas and urban settings. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of groundwater as a pathway for phosphorus and nitrogen input to a gaining urban stream. The stream at the 28-m study reach was 3\u20135<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m wide and straight, flowing generally eastward, with a relatively smooth bottom of predominantly sand, with some areas of finer sediments and a few boulders.

Detailed concentration distributions in discharging groundwater were mapped using in-stream piezometers and diffusion-based peepers, and showed elevated levels of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium compared to the stream (while nitrate levels were lower), especially along the south bank, where groundwater fluxes were lower and geochemically reducing conditions dominated. Field evidence suggests the ammonium may originate from nearby landfills, but that local sediments likely contribute the SRP. Ammonium and SRP mass discharges with groundwater were then estimated as the product of the respective concentration distributions and the groundwater flux distribution.

Downflow the confluence of tributaries, most large rivers exhibit transverse and longitudinal inhomogeneities that can be detected for tens or even hundreds of kilometers. Concordantly, a noticeable cross-sectional chemical asymmetry in the dissolved load was distinguished in the Middle Paran\u00e1 River, after the confluence of its main tributaries (i.e., the Paraguay and Upper Paran\u00e1 rivers). Water chemistry and isotopic signature in three cross-sections along the Middle Paran\u00e1 River, as well as from main and minor tributaries, and some deep (\u223c105<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>bs) and shallow boreholes (\u223c15<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>bs) located near both river banks, were analyzed in order to define the extent of mixing and identify possible contributions from groundwater discharges. Downflow the confluence of the Upper Paran\u00e1 and Paraguay rivers a chemical and isotopic asymmetry was observed, mainly through the values of EC, major ions (Ca<sup loc=\"post\">2+</sup>, Na<sup loc=\"post\">+</sup>, Mg<sup loc=\"post\">2+</sup>, Cl<sup loc=\"post\">\u2212</sup> and SO<inf loc=\"post\">4</inf> <sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> <sup loc=\"post\">\u2212</sup>), some trace elements (Fe, U, Th, Ba, Sr, As and REE) and stable isotopes (\u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O and \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">2</sup>H). Toward its western margin, higher elemental concentrations which resembled that of the Paraguay River were measured, whereas at the eastern border, waters were more diluted and preserved the chemical signature of the Upper Paran\u00e1 River. This variability remained detectable at least until \u223c225<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km downflow the confluence, where differences between western and eastern margins were less evident. At \u223c580<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km downflow the confluence, a slight inversion in the transverse chemical asymmetry was observed. This trend switch can be the result of the input of solutes from minor tributaries that reach the main channel from the East and/or may be due to higher groundwater discharges from the East bank. A mass balance model was applied, as a first approach, to estimate the groundwater inflow using the geochemical tracer <sup loc=\"pre\">222</sup>Rn. The results indicate that groundwater contributions represent between \u223c0.5% and 6% of the total water inputs to the Middle Paran\u00e1 River under baseflow conditions. This implies that the chemical asymmetry in the Middle Parana River is mostly due to the incomplete mixing of the main tributaries. Though the influence of groundwater is not a determining factor in the chemical variability of the river, it may partially explain the higher concentrations of some trace elements found in the eastern margin \u223c580<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km downflow the confluence.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

From a theoretical point of view this approach for hydrological applications should be looked upon as a generalisation of a Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve expansion. The eigenvalue problem is then represented by a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind over the spatial domain, which in a hydrological application is defined by the principal drainage area. Most methods for numerical solution of this equation entail reduction to an approximately equivalent algebraic problem. The problem is to correctly account for drainage areas and drainage patterns, as the irregularity in sizes of drainage areas might violate the orthogonality if not accounted for correctly. A basic solution to the problem is developed and demonstrated on discharge observations from the Upper Magdalena drainage basin, Colombia. Seven discharge time series are used to determine the empirical orthogonal functions and principal components and four series are used for validation of the application for gap filling and estimation at ungauged sites. The results show a high accuracy for larger basins while those for mountain headwater stations are moderately good. For these latter stations the gain of a short period of observations compared to no observations at all is 5% increase in the coefficient of determination. The results confirm the plausibility of the theoretical approach.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
