This study explores the existence of previously unrecognised features in this area \u2013 karst pocket valleys \u2013 and gives a review on pocket valleys worldwide. Initial GIS analyses were followed up by detailed field work, sampling, mapping and measuring of morphological, geological, and hydrological characteristics of representative valleys on the Wylie and Hampton scarps of the Nullarbor Plain. Rock and sand samples were examined for mineralogy, texture and grain size, and a U\u2013Pb dating of a speleothem from a cave within a pocket valley enabled the establishment of a time frame of the pocket valleys formation and its palaeoenvironmental implications. The pocket valleys document the hydrological evolution of the Nullarbor karst system and the Neogene\u2013Pleistocene palaeoclimatic evolution of the southern hemisphere. A review of pocket valleys in different climatic and geological settings suggests that their basic characteristics remain the same, and their often overlooked utility as environmental indicators can be used for further palaeoenvironmental studies. The main period of intensive karstification and widening of hydrologically active underground conduits is placed into the wetter climates of the Pliocene epoch. Subsequent drier climates and lowering of the watertable that followed sea-level retreat in the Quaternary resulted in formation of the pocket valleys (gravitational undermining, slumping, exudation and collapse), which, combined with periodic heavy rainfall events and discharge due to impeded drainage, caused the retreat of the pocket valleys from the edge of escarpments.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Based on its geomorphological characteristics, we divided this zone into three types that have hillside profiles with distinct shapes and gradients, grain components and sizes, and land uses. Although the three types of the zone have experienced the same set of geomorphological processes under the new annually cyclic hydrological regime, their responses and the associated morphologies are distinguishable. Thus we depicted them separately. Accompanied with these processes are geochemical and biological processes that bring about exacerbated pollution and destroyed ecosystem in this zone.

This is not sufficient to explain the 6\u20139<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m MSL rise estimated for the LIG, which implies that a significant contribution to the LIG highstand came from Antarctica. Following the LIG the GrIS grew and attained its maximum volume of about 12<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m global sea-level equivalents (SLEs) between 18 and 16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP. Since then the GrIS margins have retreated on an order of several hundred km, following a general pattern of lagged response to changes in high-latitude summer insolation and global greenhouse gas concentrations. On shorter timescales and over smaller spatial scales the combination of internal ice-sheet dynamics and external climate dynamics has often resulted in a more complex and asynchronous behaviour of the ice-sheet margin. The GrIS probably reached its minimum Holocene extent around 4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP, and modelling studies suggest that it contributed to a rise in global MSL of less than 0.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m relative to the present at this time. A period of steady growth followed the Holocene minimum and in many areas the ice sheet advanced beyond its present limits during the \u2018Little Ice Age\u2019 (i.e. the last few centuries). Currently the GrIS occupies an area of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00d7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>10<sup loc=\"post\">6</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and features a volume of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.96<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00d7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>10<sup loc=\"post\">6</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>, which amounts to ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>7.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m SLE. Observations show that the rate of mass loss from the GrIS has been accelerating over the past few decades, and ice sheet modelling indicates that we have to go back to the last deglaciation (around 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP) in order to find sustained melt rates that were higher than those experienced over the last decade. The future development of the GrIS will have a profound influence on sea level, both globally and regionally, but there are large uncertainties related to how the GrIS will respond to future global warming. Based on a range of modelling studies employing different emission scenarios, the GrIS is expected to contribute about 0.1\u20130.3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m to global MSL rise by the end of the 21st century. In a longer time perspective, modelling suggests that melting of the GrIS may replace ocean thermal expansion as the most important factor in future sea-level rise, potentially contributing with 0.7\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m SLE within the next 500<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years. Multi-millennial simulations show that the entire ice sheet (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>7.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m SLE) might disappear completely within less than three thousand years under high-emission scenarios, i.e. with atmospheric CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> reaching four times preindustrial levels.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, the role of soil in landscape evolution is usually not well acknowledged. In modeling landscape evolution, soil is only treated as a residue of weathering that is transported and redistributed along the hillslope. Weathering is considered as a process that produces clays and generates unconsolidated materials available for erosion. While pedology has been debating the form of qualitative factorial models for 75<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years; models for soil water, heat, solute, gas and chemical reactions in a profile have matured. As soils are distributed continuously in three dimensions across landscapes, the profile models need to consider lateral fluxes. This review outlines the role of soil in landscape modeling. First, we review the role of soil in the current landscape evolution models. We then review data and models on soil weathering rates and transport processes. We discuss soil profile models that simulate soil formation processes, and combined soil\u2013landscape evolution models. Finally we discuss how the models can be tested and validated in the real world and suggest how both soil scientists and landscape modelers can work together to address the grand challenges in modeling earth surface processes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Due to the widespread occurrence of fault zones, either in extensional or contractional regimes, knowledge about the fault sealing behaviour is of great importance to a wide spectrum of disciplines in geosciences, for instance, structural geology, geochemistry, petroleum geology, etc. Geologists have extensively studied the sealing properties of a fault zone over the last decades, ranging from fault zone architecture, fault seal types, fault seal processes, fault rock classification, research methods and controlling factors.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Although there have not been universal agreements reached on the fault seal classifications, two types of fault seals have already been recognised, which are juxtaposition seals and fault rock seals.

The study on the detailed fault zone architecture also implies the importance of fault arrays that increase the complexity of overall stratigraphic juxtaposition between hanging wall and footwall. The fault seal processes and their generated fault rocks play an important control on sealing properties of a fault zone. Temperature and stress history, which are closely related to burial history, are also found to control the sealing capacity of a fault zone to some extent.

In this paper, we review the periods of seismic unrest leading up to the 2011\u20132012 El Hierro eruption, the timeline of eruptive events, the erupted products, the wider societal impacts, and the insights garnered for our understanding of ocean island growth mechanisms and hazard management.

White coloured \u201cfloating stones\u201d (\u201cxeno-pumice\u201d) were described within the first few days of the events, the origin of which were hotly debated because of their potential implications for the character of the eruption.

In principal component analysis (PCA), also called empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, a set of orthogonal eigenfunctions is found from a spatial covariance function. These empirical basis functions often lend useful insights into physical processes in the data and serve as a useful tool for developing statistical methods. The underlying assumption in PCA is the stationarity of the data analyzed; that is, the covariance function does not depend on the origin of time. The stationarity assumption is often not justifiable for geophysical and climate variables even after removing such cyclic components as the diurnal cycle or the annual cycle. As a result, physical and statistical inferences based on EOFs can be misleading.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Some geophysical and climatic variables exhibit periodically time-dependent covariance statistics.

Most classifications of deltas have focused on subaerial plan morphology as a simplistic function of river, tide, and wave energy. New work, however, is revealing the importance of subaqueous deposits, and in particular shore-parallel sediment redistribution, in the shaping of delta planform. Delta asymmetry has emerged as an important characteristic reflective of patterns of alongshore sediment dispersal. Asymmetry has been described from onshore and offshore environments from several different types of modern deltas, but aspects of asymmetry have not been fully documented and the degree to which these patterns are recorded in deltaic strata is not yet known. This study is a comprehensive literature review of sediment distributions in modern deltas focusing on studies with high resolution geomorphic, geophysical, and geochronological datasets. We reviewed 27 deltas using over 100 papers primarily from the past 15\u201320<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years. Morphological, facies, and stratigraphic aspects were analyzed across the entire spectrum of deposits from the delta apex to the most distal muds of the prodelta. We define quantifiable indices of asymmetry describing upcurrent vs. downcurrent distribution of sediment volume, sediment area, sediment caliber, and distributary channels. Most deltas are asymmetrical to some degree with respect to one or more of these parameters. Many deltas are increasingly skewed toward the downcurrent side from proximal to distal sub-environments (i.e. delta plain, delta front, prodelta). Some deltas are skewed toward the upcurrent side in one sub-environment and toward the downcurrent side in another sub-environment. Sand is preferentially deposited on the downcurrent side of most deltas, but distributary channels tend to develop toward the upcurrent side. The highest sand:mud ratios are often on the upcurrent side in the lower delta plain, but in the delta front these ratios are highest on the downcurrent side. These complex patterns of asymmetry reflect different combinations of controls including discharge partitioning, lobe abandonment and localized transgression, plume deflection by coastal currents, dominance of longshore current direction, variable subsidence, and other factors. These processes may result in upcurrent\u2013downcurrent variations in clinoform geometry, rates of progradation, and stratal lapping relationships. Asymmetry has multiple aspects, manifestations, and controls \u2013 even within a single delta \u2013 but the long-term preservation potential of these patterns likely varies, depending on depositional setting and shoreline trajectory. Studies of ancient deltas will be better-informed by recognizing the wide variety of controls on sediment distribution and avoiding the tendency toward a single model of delta asymmetry.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, the production of cement, key ingredient of concrete, releases roughly a tonne of CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf> into the environment with each tonne of cement production. The environmental concerns and sustainability issues associated with cement and concrete necessitate alternative and better approach in the construction. Nature, on the other hand, has a plethora of examples of sustainable habitats such as coral reefs, silk webs and ant hills. Recent advances in biotechnology have great potential of emulating nature\u2019s way of building in modern days infrastructures at a scale that would sustain increasing population. Further, many of the biological materials of nature, be it ceramics or polymeric composites formed in the process of biomineralization, provides basis for sustainable construction. This paper elaborates nature\u2019s way of construction based on biomineralization and discusses the progress of different biological pathways for sustainable construction. Main milestones achieved have been identified and the effect of biological intervention on the properties of structural materials has been highlighted. Variety of applications of biomineralization based technology in the construction has been reported. The paper briefly documents the future directions of the technology.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The closure happened in the Early Jurassic. After that time, lithosphere in Transbaikalia went through two phases of rifting; in the Early Cretaceous and again in the Late Cretaceous until present. The latter rifting event is known as the Baikal rifting. We consider the chronology of the volcanism and basin formation in the Baikal rift and show that there has been a complex relationship between the two. Extension initiated in the central part of the rift system; this area is now occupied by Lake Baikal. Sedimentary basins initially developed by deepening and widening of the central part of the rift system and then by bilateral propagation of basin formation outwards. Volcanism was generally offset from the axial rift. Considering along axis distribution of volcanism, it initiated in the central part of the system and propagated bilaterally to the modern rift ends. We argue that tectonic stress controlled localization of the eruptive centres. Extension and shearing probably caused melting at mantle depth, suggestive of the passive model of volcanism. However, when considering the Baikal rift and adjacent non-rifted regions of Mongolia in a wider context of tectonics and volcanism of Central and East Asia, it is not possible to rule out that the volcanism may be associated with mantle transition zone diapirs; thus the active model of volcanism may also apply. The diapirs are located by regional isostatic gravity anomalies and considered as upwelling parts of the upper mantle convective cell controlled by the Pacific subduction and slab stagnation in the mantle transition zone. We do not see any geochemical, geophysical and geochronological evidence for involvement of deeper mantle to explain volcanism in either Baikal rift, non-rifted regions of Mongolia or anywhere else within Central and East Asia.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Geyserites are sinters affiliated with the highest temperature (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>75\u2013100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b0C), natural geothermal fluid emissions, comprising localized, lithologically distinctive, hydrothermal silica precipitates that develop around geysers, spouters and spring-vents. They demarcate the position of hot-fluid upflow zones useful for geothermal energy and epithermal mineral prospecting. Near-vent areas also are \u201cextreme environment\u201d settings for the growth of microbial biofilms at near-boiling temperatures. Microbial biosignatures (e.g., characteristic silicified microbial textures, carbon isotopes, genetic material, lipid biomarkers) may be extracted from modern geyserite. However, because of strong taphonomic filtering and subsequent diagenesis, fossils in geyserite are very rare in the pre-Quaternary sinter record which, in and of itself, is patchy in time and space back to about 400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma. Only a few old examples are known, such as geyserite reported from the Devonian Drummond Basin (Australia), Devonian Rhynie cherts (Scotland), and a new example described herein from the spectacularly well-preserved, Late Jurassic (150<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma), Yellowstone-style geothermal landscapes of Patagonia, Argentina. There, geyserite is associated with fossil vent-mounds and silicified hydrothermal breccias of the Claudia sinter, which is geologically related to the world-class Cerro Vanguardia gold/silver deposit of the Deseado Massif, a part of the Chon Aike siliceous large igneous province. Tubular, filament-like micro-inclusions from Claudia were studied using integrated petrographic and laser micro-Raman analysis, the results of which suggest a biological origin. The putative fossils are enclosed within nodular geyserite, a texture typical of subaerial near-vent conditions. Overall, this worldwide review of geyserite confirms its significance as a mineralizing geological archive reflecting the nature of Earth's highest temperature, habitable terrestrial sedimentary environment. Hot-spring depositional settings also may serve as analogs for early Earth paleoenvironments because of their elevated temperature of formation, rapid mineralization by silica, and morphologically comparable carbonaceous material sourced from prokaryotes adapted to life at high temperatures.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Leaf shape is a key determinant of both function and structural diversity of plants, but relatively little is known about the tempo and mode of leaf morphological diversification and its correlation with tracheophyte diversity and abiotic changes during this remarkable macroevolutionary event, the greening of the continents. We use the extensive record of Paleozoic tracheophytes from South China to explore models of morphological evolution in early land plants. Our findings suggest that tracheophyte leaf disparity and diversity were decoupled, and that they were under different selective regimes. Two key phases in the evolution of South Chinese tracheophyte leaves can be recognized. In the first phase, from Devonian to Mississippian, taxic diversity increased substantially, as did leaf disparity, at the same time as they acquired novel features in their vascular systems, reproductive organs, and overall architecture. The second phase, through the Carboniferous\u2013Permian transition, saw recovery of wetland communities in South China, associated with a further expansion of morphologies of simple leaves and an offset shift in morphospace occupation by compound leaves. Comparison with Euramerica suggests that the floras from South China were unique in several ways. The Late Devonian radiation of sphenophyllaleans contributed significantly to the expansion of leaf morphospace, such that the evolution of large laminate leaves in this group occurred much earlier than those in Euramerica. The Pennsylvanian decrease in taxic richness had little effect on the disparity of compound leaves. Finally, the distribution in morphospace of the Permian pecopterids, gigantopterids, and equisetaleans occurred at the periphery of Carboniferous leaf morphospace.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Also the understanding of their potential and limitations is essential. For example, using only information deriving from historically and/or instrumentally recorded earthquakes, as it has been commonly applied in the past, it is not sufficient and it could be, sometimes, even misleading in terms of SHA. In the present paper, the importance of using geological information for better defining the principal seismotectonic parameters of a seismogenic source is discussed and emphasized. In order to show this, four case studies of active faults recently reactivated by strong earthquakes have been selected from the Greek Database of Seismogenic Sources (GreDaSS). Each seismogenic source is analysed twice and separately for the two <italic>sources of information</italic>: firstly, on the basis of the <italic>single-event effects</italic> as mainly provided by historically or instrumentally recorded data, and secondly, on the basis of the <italic>cumulative effects</italic> consisting of any, mainly geological, evidence caused by multiple and repeated fault reactivations of the specific seismogenic source.

As a matter of fact, an improved geological, in its broader sense, knowledge will help to fill in the gap of the geodetically and/or seismologically determined tectonic activity of hazardous regions. Moreover, including in a catalogue also the seismogenic sources that are not associated with historical and/or instrumental earthquakes will have a remarkable impact in future SHA analyses either probabilistic or deterministic ones.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The earliest episode (9.3\u20137.3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka) was exclusively confined in the upper Gangetic plain. This episode covers 29% of total time span and contributes 13% of total faults including their reactivations. Development of six faults associated with terminal fans having large age gaps indicate relatively slow rate of faulting activities in the early Holocene. The second faulting episode was started at 6.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka and continued up to 2.3<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka covering 60% time of the total time span and contributed 69% of total faults (including their reactivations). Though in most of the time the faulting events were confined in the upper Gangetic plain, but development of few faults in the middle Gangetic plain in the middle of this episode shows a transitional shift of tectonic front from the upper to the middle Gangetic plain. The third faulting episode (1.5\u20130.75<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka) is mainly confined in the middle Gangetic plain. This episode covers 11% time of the total time span and contributes 18% of faults. Out of the eight faults, seven of them are in the middle Gangetic plains. Though these three episodes have contributed in segmentation of the Gangetic plains, but the second episode was responsible for major segmentation of the region. Two major tectonically stable periods (7.3\u20136.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka and 2.3\u20131.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka) and three minor periods (in duration of 0.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka) have been observed in the region. Episodic development of faults in individual tectonic blocks indicates that the stress distribution along the plains is non-uniform which can also be correlated to the adjacent corresponding segments of the Himalayan tectonics. It has been observed that, in each fault-bounded block the faulting events start slowly and later becomes more frequent. Previous work pointed out four tectonically active episodes between the Ghaghara and Kosi rivers with the oldest faulting event at 7.89<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka. However, the region west of it (i.e., between the Ghaghara and Ghaggar rivers which includes rest of the upper Gangetic plain) shows that neotectonic activities are earlier than 7.89<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ka (the oldest faulting event observed by previous study). The youngest faulting episode of the present study coincides with that of previous study and suggests that the region between the Gandak and Kosi rivers is tectonically most active at present. The tectonically stable periods pointed out in the previous study between the Ghaghara\u2013Kosi region is occupied by the faulting events in the upper Gangetic plains. Hence, instead of four tectonically active episodes, the whole Ganga plain witnesses three segmentation episodes with two major intervening stable periods. The change of orientation of the faults in the plain may be correlated to directional change of Indian plate motion, differential convergence, and upliftment rates along the Himalayan front and the spatial extension of subsurface Precambrian basement ridges into the plains.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A contributing and supporting factor to this evolution is the emergence over the last two decades of technologies able to acquire high resolution topography (HRT) (meter and sub-meter resolution) data. Landscape features can now be captured at an appropriately fine spatial resolution at which surface processes operate; this has revolutionized the way we study Earth-surface processes. The wealth of information contained in HRT also presents considerable challenges. For example, selection of the most appropriate type of HRT data for a given application is not trivial. No definitive approach exists for identifying and filtering erroneous or unwanted data, yet inappropriate filtering can create artifacts or eliminate/distort critical features. Estimates of errors and uncertainty are often poorly defined and typically fail to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the dataset, which may introduce bias or error for many analyses. For ease of use, gridded products are typically preferred rather than the more information-rich point cloud representations. Thus many users take advantage of only a fraction of the available data, which has furthermore been subjected to a series of operations often not known or investigated by the user. Lastly, standard HRT analysis work-flows are yet to be established for many popular HRT operations, which has contributed to the limited use of point cloud data.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">In this review, we identify key research questions relevant to the Earth-surface processes community within the theme of mass and energy transfer across landscapes and offer guidance on how to identify the most appropriate topographic data type for the analysis of interest. We describe the operations commonly performed from raw data to raster products and we identify key considerations and suggest appropriate work-flows for each, pointing to useful resources and available tools. Future research directions should stimulate further development of tools that take advantage of the wealth of information contained in the HRT data and address the present and upcoming research needs such as the ability to filter out unwanted data, compute spatially variable estimates of uncertainty and perform multi-scale analyses. While we focus primarily on HRT applications for mass and energy transfer, we envision this review to be relevant beyond the Earth-surface processes community for a much broader range of applications involving the analysis of HRT.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

It has been found that a significantly enhanced East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is characterized by increased rainfall in northern China and by reduced rainfall in southern China, and this relationship occurs on different time scales during the Holocene. This study presents results from a diverse range of proxy paleoclimatic records from northern China where precipitation variability is traditionally considered as an EASM proxy. Our aim is to evaluate the evolution of the EASM during the Holocene and to compare it with all of the published stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the Asian monsoon region in order to explore the potential mechanism(s) controlling the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O. We found that the intensity of the EASM during the Holocene recorded by the traditional EASM proxy of moisture (or precipitation) records from northern China is significantly different from the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records. The EASM maximum occurred during the mid-Holocene, challenging the prevailing view of an early Holocene EASM maximum mainly inferred from stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in eastern China. In addition, all of the well-dated Holocene stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records, covering a broad geographical region, exhibit a remarkably similar trend of variation and are statistically well-correlated on different time scales, thus indicating a common signal. However, in contrast with the clear consistency in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in all of the cave records, both instrumental and paleoclimatic records exhibit significant spatial variations in rainfall on decadal-to-centennial time scales over eastern China. In addition, both paleoclimatic records and modeling results suggest that Holocene East Asian summer monsoon precipitation reached a maximum at different periods in different regions of China. Thus the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, modern observations indicate that the moisture for precipitation in the East Asian monsoon region is mainly derived from the Indian Ocean. The moisture transport route from the Indian Ocean to the East Asian monsoon region during the Holocene is almost identical to that of modern precipitation. Therefore the strong correlation of \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in the EASM and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regions, and the similarity of the pattern of latitudinal changes in \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in stalagmites and in modern meteoric precipitation along the water vapor transport route, further suggests that the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region are essentially a signal of the isotopic composition of precipitation, which is determined mainly by changes in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O of atmospheric vapor in the upstream source region over the Indian Ocean and Indian Monsoon region via the upstream depletion mechanism. Finally, the main trends of the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records are strongly correlated with the known evolution of the ISM, and therefore these records reflect the history of the ISM rather than that of the EASM. Our findings support the conclusion that EASM variability is mainly controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and was strongly modulated by ice volume during the last deglaciation and early Holocene, which delayed the response of the EASM maximum to peak insolation forcing.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Osmoregulation is a key characteristic in determining the ability of a marine body type to tolerate freshwater. The literature on over three hundred localities worldwide covering Phanerozoic lacustrine sites and Paleozoic to Lower Triassic marine-influenced sites were searched and those containing microconchid fossils ranging from \u201cfreshwater to marine\u201d were documented; data collection included presence or absence of these worm tubes, their preservation mode as transported or in life position, and their associated fauna and flora along with paleoenvironmental interpretation. These worm tubes are not documented from any purely freshwater continental paleoenvironment unconnected to the ocean. All fossil occurrences of these microconchid tubes are in association with coastlines, whether within a nonmarine-marine transition (tidal coast, estuary, delta) or a distal transition floodplain within a low-gradient coastal area potentially affected by rare storm surges or tsunamis. The biology of this organism supports a marine affinity because of its and its sister phylum Brachiopoda need for osmoregulation within marine salinities only. Opportunistic settling on hard substrates or plants and the growth of a shell occurring within an hour during larval settlement are similar to modern spirorbid polychaete worms.

Indeed, the Danube River and tributaries may themselves be responsible for the transportation of large volumes of silt that ultimately drive loess formation in the middle and lower reaches of this large catchment. However, this vast loess province lacks a unified stratigraphic scheme. European loess research started in the late 17th century in the Danube Basin with the work of Count Luigi Ferdinand Marsigli. Since that time numerous investigations provided the basis for the pioneering stratigraphic framework proposed initially by Kukla (1970, 1977) in his correlations of loess with deep-sea sediments. Loess\u2013palaeosol sequences in the middle and lower reaches of the Danube River basin were a key part of this framework and contain some of the longest and most complete continental climate records in Europe, covering more than the last million years. However, the very size of the Danube loess belt and the large number of countries it covers presents a major limiting factor in developing a unified approach that enables continental scale analysis of the deposits. Local loess\u2013palaeosol stratigraphic schemes have been defined separately in different countries and the difficulties in correlating such schemes, which often change significantly with advances in age-dating, have limited the number of basin-wide studies. A unified basin-wide stratigraphic model would greatly alleviate these difficulties and facilitate research into the wider significance of these loess records. Therefore we review the existing stratigraphic schemes and define a new Danube Basin wide loess stratigraphy based around a synthetic type section of the Mo\u0161orin and Stari Slankamen sites in Serbia. We present a detailed comparison with the sedimentological and palaeoclimatic records preserved in sediments of the Chinese Loess Plateau, with the oxygen isotope records from deep-sea sediments, and with classic European Pleistocene stratigraphic subdivisions. The hierarchy of Danubian stratigraphic units is determined by climatically controlled environmental shifts, in a similar way to the Chinese loess stratigraphic scheme. A new unified Danube loess stratigraphic model has a number of advantages, including preventing confusion resulting from the use of multiple national schemes, a more transparent basis, and the potential to set Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental changes recorded in the Danube catchment area into a global context. The use of a very simple labelling system based on the well-established Chinese loess scheme facilitates interpretation of palaeoenvironmental information reported from the Danube Basin loess sites in a wider more accessible context that can be readily correlated world-wide. This stratigraphic approach also provides, for the first time, an appropriate framework for the development of an integrated, pan-European and potentially pan-Eurasian loess stratigraphic scheme.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, the margins of many ancient ice-sheets are poorly defined on palaeogeographic reconstructions. The extent and outlines of ancient ice sheets can be better understood through careful documentation of sediments deposited at the ice-sheet margin. An outstanding example is provided herein based on an end-Ordovician archive in Libya (Tihemboka area, Murzuq Basin). The four sets of structures include: i) subglacial glaciotectonic structures and soft sediment deformations from flowing glacier ice, such as intraformational glacial striae, intraformational deformation (shear planes, sheath folds), normal microfaults, and large-scale glaciotectonic folds-and-thrusts; (ii) structures resulting from overpressured subglacial (meltwater) flows such as clastic dykes and tunnel valleys; (iii) proglacial depositional structures and facies related to high-magnitude meltwater floods such as sandstone intraclasts, large-scale bedforms resulting from supercritical flows, climbing-dune cross-stratification and kettle holes; and (iv) deformation structures resulting from free floating and nonglacier ice such as ice-keel scours and ice-crystal marks. Such a set of structures points to an ice-marginal (essentially continental) depositional setting, and provides an excellent suite of criteria to identify margins of ancient ice sheets in the stratigraphic record. At a regional scale, a reconstruction through time and space of the related depositional wedge is proposed. This corresponded to a seismic-scale (&amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>120<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m in thickness, 40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km in length) ice-marginal wedge in front of an essentially warm-based ice-sheet inducing concomitant large-scale glaciotectonic deformation, glacial basin and tunnel valley downcuttings. The related ice-front was associated with high-energy meltwater flows feeding a network of deeply incised proglacial channels downstream and, beyond them, a fluvioglacial deltaic system. Shallow ice-marginal permafrost most likely affected the depositional wedge. At a larger scale, the Tihemboka ice-marginal wedge is interpreted as related to a still-stand period over the Gondwana platform, developed over an estimated interval of a few thousands of years. Based on these data, the conditions that arose in a particularly favourable context for the development, the preservation and the identification of ice-marginal wedges in the geological record are reviewed. Significant meltwater-derived sediment deposition and aggradation in an accommodation space resulting either from preglacial inheritance, glacial downcuttings and/or glacio-isostatic lithospheric flexure, or active tectonic subsidence (&amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Myr) are required for their formation and subsequent preservation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Such information is, however, of a great importance to study the role of magmatism and volcanism as forces contributing to continental rifting. Nyamulagira (or Nyamuragira) volcano, located in the western branch of the East African Rift System, is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth and, hence, represents a good case study to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of eruptive activity in a youthful extensional setting. Since 1882, Nyamulagira produced at least 42 eruptions, offering a dense historical record for that time period. Using scientific literature, including colonial scientific documents archived at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium, field data and a detailed mapping of the volcanic field, the spatial and temporal evolution of the eruptive activity of Nyamulagira is studied in order to 1) review the current state of knowledge on eruption history and dynamics at that volcano, and 2) infer the influence of the rift on factors controlling the location, occurrence and characteristics of Nyamulagira eruptions. The results show that the duration and location of eruptions allow the distinction of four eruption groups: summit/upper-flank, classical flank, long-lived flank and remote eruptions. The interpretation of these groups suggests that Nyamulagira eruptions are related to the main crustal magmatic system and are strongly influenced by the gravitational stress field induced by the main central edifice. However, remote eruptions (1904, 1912, 1948, 1991\u20131993) are not influenced by this edifice loading and seem directly related to deeper magma reservoirs. The 1938\u20131940 eruption is also atypical, but is related to an important drainage of the upper magma plumbing system, which triggered a caldera collapse. No tectonic trigger of eruption is evidenced, but cone and eruptive fissure alignments suggest that rift structures can also influence the eruption location. In addition, the present study suggest that the major eruptions of Nyamulagira along structural axes close to Nyiragongo can induce a change in the eruptive activity of the latter hazardous volcano. Hence, the historical eruptive activity of Nyamulagira highlights the complex interplay between the magmatic system and the local and regional stress fields in controlling the location and characteristics of eruptions, in this youthful extensional tectonic setting where main volcanic edifices developed.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Most often, the estimation of the geological PoS is based on subjective judgements about probabilities for individual geological risk factors. However, such subjective probabilities are not reliable in the low-validity environments with significant degrees of uncertainty and unpredictability, to which many exploration projects belong. When explorers assign probabilities for risk factors, they are geared by their variably incomplete knowledge and fragmentary experience, use judgemental heuristics under the influence of cognitive and motivational biases, and are prone to logical fallacies (unless they are aware of these limitations and account for them in scientifically responsible ways). As a result, assessments of geological PoS tend to be inconsistent across an exploration company, which leads to biased portfolios that fail to deliver on promise. Recent research and experience from other industries suggest that algorithms are superior to expert judgements in low-validity environments. This paper presents a review of relevant literature on the psychology of decision making and risk assessment methods used in petroleum exploration, and proposes a new algorithm for geological PoS assessment, realized in the form of systematic risk tables for probabilities of six geological risk factors (structure, presence of reservoir facies, reservoir deliverability, seal, source presence and maturity, and migration). The risk tables enable explorers to convert geological information into quantitative probabilities while counteracting the deficiencies of expert judgement and reducing the effects of biases. The risk tables take into account both the data-derived and model-derived positive, negative and neutral evidence for each of the risk factors, utilize the most elementary, fundamental and relevant subsurface information and can be used in a wide variety of exploration projects. The risk tables shift the focus of geological risk assessment from arguing about the probability values to a more objective and consistent evaluation of subsurface data and models. Probabilities are extracted from risk tables in a manner transparent to all involved, including peers, managers and investors. Implementation of the risk tables will allow explorers to dispassionately and consistently put high PoS values on relatively low-risk prospects and low PoS values on relatively high-risk prospects, and would enable managers to make well-informed drilling decisions. The use of risk tables will lead to less biased prospect inventories, effective portfolio management and better long-term exploration performance.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

As a result, changes in gateway geometry can significantly alter both the pattern of global ocean circulation and associated heat transport and climate, as well as having a profound impact on local environmental conditions. Mediterranean-Atlantic marine corridors that pre-date the modern Gibraltar Strait, closed during the Late Miocene and are now exposed on land in northern Morocco and southern Spain. The restriction and closure of these Miocene connections resulted in extreme salinity fluctuations in the Mediterranean, leading to the precipitation of thick evaporites. This event is known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC). The evolution and closure of the Mediterranean-Atlantic gateways are a critical control on the MSC, but at present the location, geometry and age of these gateways is still highly controversial, as is the impact of changing Mediterranean outflow on Northern Hemisphere circulation. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the Late Miocene gateways and the nature of Mediterranean-Atlantic exchange as deduced from published studies focussed both on the sediments preserved within the fossil corridors and inferences that can be derived from data in the adjacent basins.

Primary architecture of basement and sedimentary cover rocks, which included a thick passive margin section deposited along the western continental margin, influenced patterns of subsequent deformation. The Cordilleran orogenic system, comprised of an interrelated forearc accretionary complex, magmatic arc, retroarc hinterland, Sevier fold-thrust belt, and foreland basin locally deformed by Laramide arches, developed during Jurassic to Paleogene Andean-style subduction and terrane accretion. The Sevier belt formed as a foreland-propagating (west to east) wedge mostly during Cretaceous to Paleogene time, and included a western thrust system with aerially extensive thrust sheets that carried thick passive margin strata, and an eastern thrust system that carried thinner strata. Within the Wyoming salient of the Sevier belt, major thrust and fold traces display systematic map-view curvature about an average N-S structural trend, reflecting a component of primary curvature related to sedimentary prism architecture, followed by 60-80% vertical-axis rotation of thrust sheets related to curved fault slip and interaction with Laramide arches at the salient ends. Internal deformation in the western thrust sheets was limited within strong shallower levels, whereas deeper levels underwent shear and vertical flattening near a weak basal fault zone. Internal deformation in the eastern thrust sheets included widespread early layer-parallel shortening (LPS), followed by concentration of slip onto weak fault zones. Approximately 200<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km of thin-skin shortening in the Sevier belt was transferred into lower crustal thickening and uplift of an orogenic plateau in the hinterland to the west. Synorogenic strata were deposited in an evolving foreland basin to the east that formed during flexural loading of thrust sheets and regional dynamic subsidence during subduction. Overall E-oriented shortening in the Sevier belt is interpreted to reflect increased gravitational potential energy and evolving topographic slopes from a hinterland plateau through a growing thrust wedge. Laramide basement-cored arches and intervening basins developed during later Cretaceous to Paleogene time, overlapping with younger stages of Sevier deformation. Arches and associated reverse faults display a wide range of trends within an overall NW-SE oriented, anastomosing network, partly reflecting primary basement heterogeneities. Limited vertical-axis rotations were localized along obliquely trending arch forelimbs and near arch intersections. Internal deformation in the foreland included limited LPS that refracted near variably trending arches. Laramide deformation was spatially and temporally correlated with a region of flat-slab subduction, recorded by changes in magmatic and subsidence patterns. Overall ENE-oriented shortening in the Laramide belt was at low angles to relative plate motion, likely reflecting increased plate coupling near a cratonic lithosphere keel. An integrated model for tectonic evolution of the Sevier and Laramide belts includes: influence of primary sedimentary architecture and basement weaknesses; enhanced plate coupling from increased overriding plate motion, fast convergence rates, and development of a flat-slab segment; linkage of upper crustal shortening in the Sevier belt with lower crustal thickening and uplift of a hinterland plateau; interaction between frontal thrusts in the Sevier belt and Laramide arches with differently oriented stress fields; concentrated slip along weak fault zones; redistribution of mass by erosion and deposition of synorogenic strata; and a switch to orogenic collapse during decreased convergence rates and slab removal.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study synthesizes existing clay mineralogical and geochemical data from ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1500 samples from the seafloor and surrounding rivers, deepwater mooring observation results, and high-resolution glacial-cyclic clay mineralogy records from six high-quality sediment cores. Source-to-sink sediment transport from the river mouth to the continental shelf and then to the abyssal basin is investigated at two time scales: modern process and Late Quaternary glacial cycles. The results firstly show the high diversity of clay mineralogical and geochemical compositions in riverbed surface sediments surrounding the South China Sea, e.g., dominant illite and chlorite in Taiwan, overwhelming majority of smectite in Luzon, dominant kaolinite in South China, and similar amounts of the four clay mineral species in Red and Mekong river systems. The formation of these fluvial sediments through chemical weathering in surrounding drainage systems is controlled principally by the East Asian monsoon climate with warm temperature and high precipitation, and subordinately by tectonic activity and specific lithological character. The basin-wide distribution of clay mineral assemblages combined with neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions reflects strong provenance control and differential settling effects. The differential settling of kaolinite in slightly saline and proximal regions relative to smectite in more saline and distal regions is well demonstrated in the South China Sea. Through combining clay mineralogical distributions on the seafloor with observed oceanic current systems, the modern transport pathways can be well established, e.g., in the northern South China Sea, illite and chlorite from Taiwan are mainly carried by contour currents with the strong influence of mesoscale eddies.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">High-resolution sediment dynamic analysis for the Late Quaternary reveals different sediment transport patterns in the northern, western, and southern South China Sea when the land-sea configuration dramatically changed during glacial conditions.

In the south, the clay mineral input indicates intensive chemical weathering during interglacial periods and strengthened physical erosion during glacial periods. The transport of terrigenous sediments since the last glaciation is quantitatively reconstructed through studying two deepwater sediment cores located in the northern South China Sea. The relative contributions from three provenances (South China, Luzon, and Taiwan) highlight their distinct variability over the last 28<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, implying that the southward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at 16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP caused an increased sediment contribution from South China, the intensified influence of the Kuroshio Current intrusion controls more efficient westward transport of Luzon sediments, and the stronger deepwater current transports Taiwan-sourced sediments further westward from the last glaciation to the Holocene.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Notches are found from the Tropics to the Poles and in a wide range of rock types, virtually tideless to megatidal seas, and high to low wave energy environments. The emphasis in the literature has been on notches in calcareous rocks in warm, microtidal seas, and with the general assumption that they have been produced by bioerosion or chemical dissolution. Few scientifically rigorous attempts have been made to determine the processes responsible for notch formation in different environments and rock types, however, or to determine whether different processes produce distinct notch morphologies within the same tidal and wave environments. The use of notches as palaeo-sea level markers, and to determine rates of tectonic uplift, has been particularly important in the Mediterranean. Notches are more difficult to employ for this purpose in the middle latitudes, where higher waves and tides amplify the range of elevations over which the erosional mechanisms are effective, as well as increasing the exposure and effect of rocks of variable resistance to erosion. To maximize the utility of notches as sea level markers, and to better understand and model their development in a wide range of environments, we need to understand and be able to quantify the relationship between notch shape and size and the elevational efficacy of the various erosional processes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The North China Craton (NCC) represents a natural laboratory to evaluate early Precambrian crustal evolution. The tectonic framework of the NCC is composed of two major crustal blocks, the Western Block (WB) and the Eastern Block (EB). The northwestern margin of the EB preserves voluminous metamorphosed supracrustal basaltic to andesitic rocks of ca. 2522\u20132640<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma in the Fuxin greenstone belt within the Western Liaoning Province (WLP). These were intruded by the magmatic precursors of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2495\u20132521<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma granitoid gneisses, which were generally metamorphosed under ca. 2485<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma regional metamorphism up to granulite facies, followed by ca. 2401\u20132450<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma amphibolite facies retrogression. Geochemically, the metamorphosed volcanic rocks can be subdivided into five groups with affinities to MORBs, island arc tholeiites (IATs), calc-alkaline basalts (CABs), high-magnesium andesites (HMAs), and adakites. The petrogenesis and temporal\u2013spatial distribution of these metamorphosed volcanic rocks and the intrusive granitoid gneisses in the WLP indicate that this basement terrane probably evolved as an intra-oceanic arc system, with major crustal growth at ca. 2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga. These rocks record complex crust\u2013mantle evolution history as follows. Partial melting of the depleted to slightly enriched asthenospheric mantle at a spreading ridge occurred at ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2600\u20132640<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma, generating both MORB-like rocks and juvenile oceanic lithospheric mantle sources. The mantle sources were gradually metasomatized by slab-derived fluids and melts during ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2506\u20132550<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma, and the partial melting of both the metasomatized lithospheric mantle and the descending oceanic slabs generated IATs, CABs, HMAs, and adakites (as well as tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite (TTG) gneisses of the high-magnesium group). Meanwhile, the coeval underplating of mantle-derived materials triggered the partial melting of the arc-root materials, yielding TTG gneisses of the low-magnesium group. Finally, the accretion of the intra-oceanic arc terrane to the ancient nucleus of the EB at ca. 2490<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma resulted in the regional granulite-facies metamorphism and crustal anatexis (resulting in the formation of potassium-rich granitoid rocks), possibly related to asthenospheric upwelling.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Based on a comprehensive analysis of the basement terranes in the EB, we propose that a late Neoarchean (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) intra-oceanic arc system with relict MORB-like basaltic rocks bordering the northwestern margin of the continental nucleus (ca. 2.7\u20133.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) was established, extending from northern Liaoning Province, through western Liaoning Province, the Zunhua\u2013Qinglong block of eastern Hebei Province, northern Hebei Province, and the Huai\u2019an\u2013Xuanhua complexes of northwestern Hebei Province, up to the Wutai complex. To the northwest of the proposed \u201cWutai\u2013Zunhua\u2013Majuanzi\u201d boundary, the intra-oceanic arc system is characterized by the lack of ancient crystalline basement (\u2265<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga), and late Neoarchean metamorphosed basaltic rocks showing geochemical affinities to MORBs\u2013IATs\u2013CABs represent the oldest rocks yet identified.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">Accordingly, the development of both plume-related komatiites and metamorphosed arc-related calc-alkaline volcanic rocks as well as granitoid gneisses within the interior of the EB to the east suggest early Neoarchean (ca. 2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) plume\u2013craton and plume\u2013arc interactions as the major crust\u2013mantle geodynamic processes. In contrast, late Neoarchean (ca. 2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) slab\u2013wedge interaction and arc\u2013continent accretion processes are compatible with the intra-oceanic arc system as well as the asymmetric distribution of the basement rocks.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The lined or mantled burrows <italic>Skolithos linearis</italic> Haldeman, 1840, may be also included as potential senior synonym of <italic>Laevicyclus</italic>. The eponym of the ichnofamily, the trace fossil <italic>Siphonichnus</italic>, is a common ichnogenus which has been frequently reported from the Devonian to modern deposits around the world, particularly in connection with coal mining and from well cores in the oil and gas industry. Although already known as burrows with an eye-shaped cross-section and <italic>Planolites ophthalmoides</italic> to the coal miners in Germany since the 1930-ties, <italic>Siphonichnus</italic> became formally introduced not until 1980. Moreover, some characteristic features (e.g., variable orientation) were not included in the original ichnogeneric diagnosis but are important for its recognition. The clarification of its ichnotaxonomical status becomes necessary, for instance in order to use this trace fossil as palaeoenvironmental indicator. Consequently, <italic>Siphonichnus ophthalmoides</italic> (Jessen, 1950) is the valid type ichnospecies of the ichnogenus <italic>Siphonichnus</italic>. By means of modern analogues, <italic>Siphonichnus</italic> can be attributed to the activity of endobenthic bivalves such as tellinids and nuculids, which include siphon-bearing species with a predominantly deposit-feeding behaviour. Previous interpretations have regarded <italic>Siphonichnus</italic> as the dwelling trace (domichnion) of bivalves feeding on organic material from the sediment surface or above it, which are able to adjust their position with respect to erosion and deposition (equilibrichnion). However, the characteristics of the emended diagnosis also indicate the activity of a (temporarily?) vagile endobenthic organism for the purpose of locomotion and partly deposit-feeding. A review of reported occurrences of <italic>S. ophthalmoides</italic> (and its synonyms) shows it as a clear indicator of shallow-marine and marginal-marine environments, often related to fluctuating salinities and freshwater influx. Its distribution ranges from proximal offshore and shoreface to deltaic, estuarine and lagoonal environments, and rarely into the deep sea.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This review broadens the typical definition of legacy sediments and discusses human activities that create legacy effects on sediments in terms of three categories: activities that reduce sedimentation within river corridors \u2014 defined as channels, floodplains and riparian zones, and hyporheic zones; activities that enhance sedimentation in river corridors; and activities that contaminate river sediments with diverse pollutants. People reduce sedimentation within river corridors via three basic mechanisms: reducing sediment supply to the river corridor through changes in land cover or by trapping and storing sediment within the river corridor; increasing the ability of a river to transport sediments downstream by either increasing water supply to the channel or reducing physical channel complexities that promote flow separation, hydraulic resistance, and sedimentation; and disconnecting channels from floodplains, which are typically sediment storage zones and sediment sources for the channel. Conversely, enhanced sedimentation within river corridors results from increased sediment supply from uplands or upstream river segments and from decreased ability of a river to transport sediments downstream. Contamination of river sediments can result from nearly every conceivable human activity within a drainage basin (e.g., deforestation, agriculture, urbanization, industrial facilities, wastewater treatment). Contaminants can also enter a drainage basin from sources outside the basin boundaries because of contaminant transport within the tissues of migratory animals and via atmospheric deposition. Because many contaminants travel adsorbed to sediments, these pollutants can be concentrated within river corridors by activities that enhance sediment deposition. Legacy effects on sediments are now ubiquitous and abundant within river corridors around the world and can continue to alter river form and function long after cessation of the human activity that created the legacy. River management must be informed by accurate knowledge of the distribution and characteristic of legacy effects on sediments and geoscientists can contribute specialized knowledge to understanding and managing these sediments.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Nowadays, the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) can be obtained from ground-based global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and space-borne GNSS Radio Occultation, which can be used to investigate the seismo-ionospheric disturbances and may provide insights on the earthquake. In this paper, GNSS ionospheric seismology is presented and reviewed, including methods, observation results and characteristics. Case studies of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake are presented using ground-based GNSS observations. Significant co-/post-seismic ionospheric anomalies are found from continuous GNSS observations near the epicenters, showing that the seismic ionospheric total electron content (TEC) disturbances were derived mainly from the main shock. The detailed pattern and evolution of the ionospheric disturbance are revealed by denser GNSS observations. Some simulations explore the nature of the ionospheric perturbation, highlighting that acoustic-gravity waves are generated close to the epicenter, and that surface Rayleigh waves and tsunamis generate in the atmosphere/ionosphere acoustic and gravity waves respectively. These waves are induced by solid-Earth/ocean and atmosphere coupling at the ground or ocean interface with the atmosphere propagating upward until the ionosphere create strong perturbation in plasma density and plasma velocity.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The defining element of a platform is width that is used in many calculations such as determining a platform's evolutionary state or inferring how wave energy is distributed along the shore. Although a critical variable, there are no uniform criteria for defining the seaward edge. Quantification of platform width has been driven by site-specific variables, with the seaward edge defined on the basis of tides, morphology, biology, processes and sediment coverage. The lack of a uniform definition has meant that comparative studies are difficult and results are possibly spurious, as widths derived from very different criteria can vary by an order of magnitude just on the basis of which criteria is used to determine its edge. In this review a combination of morphologic and process elements is used to define the seaward edge of a shore platform. The development of strict criteria is especially needed in an environment of rising sea levels if measurements of landscape change are to be made. In addition, the advent of seamless datasets that cross the land\u2013sea boundary means that the delineation of platform morphology is no longer limited by physical access. This review concludes that the seaward edge of a shore platform will occur at or landward of wave base and should be defined as: the point where active erosion of the bedrock ceases, characterised by erosional features such as notches and block-plucking scars or the deposition of sediment of such a thickness that the underlying bedrock is not exposed during storm events.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Despite more than 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years of extensive geological and geophysical research, there remains significant conjecture concerning the timing of sea-floor spreading initiation, the extent of spreading along the axis of the Red Sea, and the geodynamic processes responsible for the onset of crustal extension. Red Sea tectonic models based on geological data are dominated by single stage rift models involving protracted stretching of continental crust followed by sea floor spreading at ca 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma, and include both asymmetric and symmetrical extension models. Geophysical data suggest that an oceanic crust occurs beneath the Red Sea shelves, although exactly how this crust has evolved remains undecided. Equally, arguments have been made in favor of the sedimentary shelves forming on extended continental crust, and that oceanic crust is restricted to the present day Red Sea axial valley. However, our synthesis shows that none of the models proposed so far is applicable to the entire Red Sea basin. The distribution and timing of the Red Sea crustal extension and sea-floor spreading may have been influenced by subduction-related far field forces due to complex plate interactions along the northern edge of the Arabian plate during Early Miocene. Our reassessment suggests that following the arrival of the Afar plume the southern Red Sea underwent rapid extension culminating in the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading, which stalled during the early Miocene in the central Red Sea due to either slowing of the convergence between Arabia and Eurasia or the onset of the Arabian plate passive margin collision with Eurasia. Off axis magmatism is focused on the Arabian margin and Afar depression and has been episodically active since the Miocene. We consider a formation of the Red Sea as a hybrid process involving both \u201cactive and passive\u201d rifting.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A revision of the rich and well preserved Mesozoic African naiad fauna remained one of the last main gaps. The African naiad assemblages are of Mid and Late Jurassic, late Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous age. The associations are composed of representatives of the orders Trigoniida and Unionida, the latter containing two new families and one new superfamily. Jurassic associations consist predominantly of Unionida with a distinct Eurasian link while Early Cretaceous assemblages are dominated by Asian trigoniids. Representatives of the Iridinidae and Etheriidae, African families considered to belong to the Gondwana superfamily Mullerioidea and presently widespread and highly diversified (Iridinidae), remain conspicuously absent in the fossil record till Late Cretaceous times, when a single genus is found. The conclusion that during Early Cretaceous times, a one-directional species transfer took place between Africa and Asia appears inevitable. Alternatively, the striking absence of all Gondwana families (Superfamily Mullerioidea) during Jurassic and Early Cretaceous times indicates that, for freshwater mussels, an impenetrable barrier existed between South America and North Africa, though both continents were (supposedly) still linked during most of that period.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The geomorphic and stratigraphic products of this source-to-sink sediment transfer record signals of external environmental forcings, as well as internal, or autogenic, dynamics of the sedimentary system. Here, we evaluate environmental signal propagation across sediment-routing systems with emphasis on sediment supply, Qs, as the carrier of up-system forcings. We review experimental, numerical, and natural examples of source-to-sink sediment routing and signal propagation during three timescales: (1) Historic, which includes measurement and monitoring of events and processes of landscape change and deposition during decades to centuries; (2) Centuries to several millions of years, referred to as intermediate timescale; and (3) Deep time. We discuss issues related to autogenic dynamics of sediment transport, transient storage, and release that can introduce noise, lags, and/or completely mask signals of external environmental forcings. We provide a set of conceptual and practical tools for evaluating sediment supply within a source-to-sink context, which can inform interpretations of signals from the sedimentary record. These tools include stratigraphic and sediment-routing system characterization, sediment budget determination, geochronology, detrital mineral analysis (e.g., thermochronology), comparative analog approaches, and modeling techniques to measure, calculate, or estimate the magnitude and frequency of external forcings compared to the characteristic response time of the sediment-routing systems.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The transient state is often related to the (dis)connectivity of the many constituent parts of geomorphic systems as a result of sediment storage along the sediment flow path from its source to the final sink. The response time of geomorphic systems to external changes is thus depended on the residence time of sediment in various storage compartments. Here, I present a mathematical concept based on reservoir theory to model residence time of sediment using millennial scale sediment budgets. The framework sheds light on the limitation of the sediment delivery ratio, which is often used as a measure of sediment connectivity in geomorphic systems, and provides analytical information on process type, pace of sediment flux and connectivity of storage compartments along the sediment cascade. The application of the reservoir theory to geomorphic systems under agricultural land use show that sediment delivery ratios are linked to the virtual velocity of the eroded sediment, the time since the onset of agricultural land use and the size of the studied basins. With respect to the temporal evolution of sediment storages that temporaryly remove sediment from the conveyor belt, the framework aims to estimate the sediment residence time in storages, which is linked to the effective timescale of disconnectivity. Reanalysis of a long-term empirical sediment budget from Central Europe reveals that the response to agricultural land use, which started ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>5000<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>yrs. BP, is mainly buffered by the long residence time of sediment on hillslopes (in the order of 10<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years), which results in a delayed floodplain aggradation. Furthermore, the framework was applied to paraglacial mountain systems that inherit striking evidences of Pleistocene glacial erosion and still recover from the change from glacial to interglacial conditions as a consequence of the reduced lateral and longitudinal connectivity. I show that paraglacial response times of sediment flux in mountain headwater in the Canadian Rocky Mountains range in the order of 100\u2013400<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka. The results indicate that response times at the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions are much longer than the return interval of major glaciations, causing a transient behavior of mountain headwater basins during interglacial periods. The presented reanalysis of millennial-scale sediment budgets of agricultural and mountain geosystems provides an integrative framework to link paleo-environmental reconstructions with the connectivity of transient geomorphic system to external changes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

While some authors postulate that distributary (or distributive) fluvial systems (DFS) patterns are the most common systems likely to dominate the present day continental sedimentary basins and the alluvial rock record, others suggest that a variety of fluvial styles including axial fluvial systems, are preserved, thus rejecting the dominance of DFSs. Arguments in favor or against the dominance of DFSs in the geological basins are mainly based on two-dimensional analysis of recent axial rivers and DFSs. However, the Quaternary record of the largest depositional tracts on Earth was not assessed in a comparative way. To fill that void, the most important Quaternary areas of sedimentation in the world, such as the alluvial belts of the largest rivers, the largest megafans and other impressive fluvial dominated wetlands in active tectonic basins are analyzed. These results are based on field work conducted by the author in many of the discussed areas, a literature review and analysis of remotely sensed imagery. Specific examples are examined from the largest axial rivers of the Amazon basin, the Paran\u00e1 River, Yangtze River, among others, and from the large depositional tracts in forelands, and intraplate basins such as the Chaco, the Bananal, Pantanal, and Ucamara, which contain a variety of complex avulsive systems and megafans.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">The present day occurrence and characteristics of braided, meandering and anabranching rivers are reviewed. It is concluded that the scarcity of purely braided systems in large rivers is notable as they are constrained to small-medium sized rivers, relatively short length piedmont courses, alluvial fans or proximal areas of some megafans. Meandering and mainly a variety of anabranching systems are dominant in large rivers but anabranching systems are the end member for megarivers. Once considered an oddity, anabranching rivers are now considered major and fundamental representatives of the fluvial world. Previous studies related the appearance of anabranching rivers to the diversification of terrestrial vegetation. To that end, the hypothesis that anabranching styles diversified after the emergence of grass in the Tertiary is considered.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">A quantitative assessment on area coverage and sediment trap capacity of major rivers (Amazon and major tributaries, Parana, Magdalena among others) and megafans (Chaco and Pantanal among others) in South America is used to compare the potential preservation and storage capacity of axial rivers, avulsive rivers, and megafans. Results demonstrate that axial and avulsive rivers cover more area than the largest megafans from Chaco and Pantanal, and they currently trap more sediment.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0020\" view=\"all\">The potential preservation of the fluvial sediments is discussed and it is concluded that a major part of the DFSs recorded in wedge-top depositional zones, fore-arc settings and peripheral forelands are susceptible to short term preservation or destruction (tens of million year scale) by tectonic deformation and erosion. A variety of intraplate basins, aulacogen, and foreland mixed zones (forebulge\u2013backbulge-platforms basins) containing the largest rivers, avulsive systems, and the distal part of gigantic megafans, are more favorable tectonic settings for long-term potential preservation. Finally, it is concluded that megafans, a variety of other avulsive systems, and linear (axial) fluvial belts of major rivers have the potential for preservation in the geological record.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0025\" view=\"all\">Despite findings based on Quaternary records, a major challenge remains to identify characteristic facies assemblages for reconstructing large rivers, avulsive fluvial systems and megafans in the geological archive.

Specifically-reduced maximum sizes of benthic marine invertebrates have been proposed for the entire Early Triassic. This concept was originally based on observations on Early Triassic gastropods from the western USA basin and the Dolomites (N Italy) and it stimulated subsequent studies on other taxonomic groups. However, only a few studies have tested the validity of the Lilliput effect in gastropods to determine whether the paucity of large-sized gastropods is a genuine signal or the result of a poor fossil record and insufficient sampling. In combination with a review of the literature, we document numerous new, abundant, large-sized gastropods from the Griesbachian outcrops of Greenland and from the Smithian\u2013early Spathian interval in the southwestern USA. We show that large-sized (\u201cGulliver\u201d) gastropods (i) were present soon after the PT mass extinction, (ii) occurred in various basins, sedimentary facies and environmental contexts (from shallow to deeper settings), and (iii) belong to diverse higher-rank taxa. Focusing on the western USA basin, we investigate areas from which microgastropod shell-beds were previously presented as being typical. However, we show that Gulliver gastropods do occur in the very same areas. Insufficient sampling effort is probably the main reason for the rarity of reports of large Early Triassic gastropods, which is supported by preliminary rarefaction-based simulations. Finally, it appears that the recently documented middle to late Smithian climate shifts and the severe end-Smithian extinction of nekto-pelagic faunas did not reduce maximum shell sizes of gastropods.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",
