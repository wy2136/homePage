        "description": "\n\nTime series of horizontal velocities, echo intensity, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure were collected for \u223c200 days in a Patagonian fjord to explore pycnocline motions produced by the Southern Hemisphere's baroclinic annular mode (BAM). The BAM variability occurs between 20 and 30 days and is associated with fluctuations in atmospheric kinetic energy and in turbulent fluxes of heat. Spectra of horizontal velocities and normalized echo intensity in the fjord's water showed highest energy between 25 and 30 days. This was explained by sustained westerly winds associated with extreme low-pressure systems (\u223c900 hPa) that had periodicity related to the BAM. Wind forcing produced >40 cm s-1 along- and cross-channel currents in the surface layer, which in turn created a wind-induced setup toward the head of the fjord. The setup was accompanied by a deepening of the pycnocline (from 5 to 15 m depth) with \u223c25 to 30-day periodicity, as derived from the normalized echo intensity. The dominant empirical orthogonal function mode of the normalized echo intensity profiles explained 70.8% of the variance and also exhibited a \u223c25 to 30-day periodicity. Further, a wavelet and spectral analysis of 10 years of atmospheric pressure indicated peaks between 25 and 30 days each year, indicating that the BAM consistently influences weather patterns in Chilean Patagonia. This is the first documented case of baroclinic annular variability in a specific region of the Southern Hemisphere, and of its effects on fjord systems. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nSuspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration profiles of the lowest 2 m of the water column and particle size distribution at 2 m above the bed were measured in a coastal turbidity maximum area (southern North Sea) during more than 700 days between 2006 and 2013. The long-term data series of SPM concentration, floc size and settling velocity have been ensemble averaged according to tidal range, alongshore residual flow direction and season, in order to investigate the seasonal SPM dynamics and its relation with physical and biological processes. The data show that the SPM is more concentrated in the near bed layer in summer, whereas in winter the SPM is better mixed throughout the water column. The decrease of the SPM concentration in the water column during summer is compensated by a higher near bed concentration indicating that a significant part of the SPM remains in the area during summer rather than being advected out of it. The opposite seasonality between near-bed layer and water column has to our knowledge not yet been presented in literature. Physical effects such as wave heights, wind climate or storms have a weak correlation with the observed seasonality. The argument to favor microbial activity as main driver of the seasonality lies in the observed variations in floc size and settling velocity. On average the flocs are larger and thus settling velocities higher in summer than winter. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Zanzibar Channel lies between the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar Island in the tropical western Indian Ocean, is about 100 km long, 40 km wide, and 40 m deep, and is essential to local socioeconomic activities. This paper presents a model of the seasonal and tidal dynamics of the Zanzibar Channel based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and a comparison of the model and observations. The seasonal dynamics of the channel is forced by remote processes and the local wind. Remote forcing creates the East African Coastal Current, a portion of which flows through the channel northward with a seasonally varying magnitude. The local wind enhances this seasonality in the surface Ekman layer, resulting in a stronger northward flow during the southwest monsoon season and a weak northward or occasionally southward flow during the northeast monsoon season. The tidal flows converge and diverge in the center of the channel and reduce the transport in the channel. The remotely forced, wind-forced, and tidal dynamics contain 5%, 3%, and 92% of the total kinetic energy, respectively. Despite their low kinetic energy, the remotely forced and wind-forced flows are most relevant in advecting channel water to the open ocean, which occurs in 19 days at the peak of the southwest monsoon season. The channel is well mixed, except during brief periods in the two rainy seasons, and temporarily cools between December and February. The dispersion of passive tracers is presented as an example of potential model applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA global high-resolution ocean circulation model forced by atmospheric fields and the M2 tidal constituent is used to explore plausible scenarios for the damping of low-mode internal tides. The plausibility of different damping scenarios is tested by comparing the modeled barotropic tides with TPXO8, a highly accurate satellite-altimetry constrained tide model, and by comparing the modeled coherent baroclinic tide amplitudes against along-track altimetry. Five scenarios are tested: (1) a topographic internal wave drag, argued here to represent the breaking of unresolved high vertical modes, applied to the bottom flow (default configuration), (2) a wave drag applied to the barotropic flow, (3) absence of wave drag, (4) a substantial increase in quadratic bottom friction along the continental shelves (with wave drag turned off), and (5) application of wave drag to the barotropic flow at the same time that quadratic bottom friction is substantially increased along the shelves. Of the scenarios tested here, the default configuration (1) yields the most accurate tides. In all other scenarios (2-5), the lack of damping on open-ocean baroclinic motions yields baroclinic tides that are too energetic and travel too far from their sources, despite the presence of a vigorous mesoscale eddy field which can scatter and de-cohere internal tides in the model. The barotropic tides are also less accurate in the absence of an open-ocean damping on barotropic motions, that is, in scenarios (3) and (4). The results presented here suggest that low-mode internal tides experience substantial damping in the open-ocean. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSeasonal variations of the upper ocean, such as mixed layer depth (MLD) and sea surface temperature (SST), responding to the atmospheric forcing in the North Pacific (10oN \u2013 50oN), are investigated by analyzing the Argo and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 data. The OAFlux data are also used for comparison. During the early heating period in the high-latitude ocean north of 30oN, where a seasonal thermocline is formed above the deep mixed layer under strong surface heating, the MLD h is found to be scaled as h\u221d(L\u03bb)1/2, where L is the Monin-Obukhov length scale and \u03bb is the Ekman length scale. On the other hand, in the low latitude ocean south of 30oN, where the preexisting MLD is shallow and surface heating is weak, h is found to be scaled by \u03bb. It is found that a large amount of heat flux across the MLD occurs, especially in the high-latitude ocean during the late heating period, in which h is small. It suggests the contribution by turbulent mixing across the MLD in addition to radiation penetration, and the eddy diffusivity in the high-latitude ocean is estimated as Kv \u223c 10\u22124 - 10\u22123 m2s\u22121. The heat budget of the mixed layer reveals that the contribution from the ocean heat transport is much smaller than the surface heat flux in the high-latitude ocean except in the Kuroshio region, but it is sometimes comparable in the low-latitude ocean.

        "description": "\n\nRecent field investigations of the damping of ocean surface waves over fluid muds have revealed waves on the interface between the thin layer of fluid mud and the overlying much thicker column of clear water, accompanied by bedforms on the erodible seabed beneath the fluid mud. The frequencies and wavelengths of the observed interfacial waves are qualitatively consistent with the linear dispersion relationship for long interfacial waves, but the forcing mechanism is not known. To understand the forcing, a linear model is proposed, based on the layer-averaged hydrostatic equations for the fluid mud, together with the Meyer-Peter-Mueller equation for the sediment transport within the underlying seabed, both subject to oscillatory forcing by the surface waves. If the underlying seabed is non-erodible and flat, the model indicates parametric instability to interfacial waves, but the threshold for instability is not met by the observations. If the underlying seabed is erodible, the model indicates that perturbations to the seabed elevation in the presence of the oscillatory forcing create interfacial waves, which in turn produce stresses within the fluid mud that force a net transport of sediment within the seabed toward the bedform crests, thus causing growth of both bedforms and interfacial waves. The frequencies, wavelengths, and growth rates are in qualitative agreement with the observations. A competition between mixing created by the interfacial waves and gravitational settling might control the thickness, density, and viscosity of the fluid muds during periods of strong forcing.

        "description": "\n\nWe analyzed long-term time series of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations collected along the Palagru\u017ea Sill transect (middle Adriatic) between 1952 and 2010. The data have been mostly collected on seasonal basis, allowing for extraction of seasonal signal from the series. By applying Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method, a kind of unsupervised neural network method, the processes on a decadal timescale emerged as the most relevant for changes of oceanographic properties in the middle Adriatic area. Sensitivity studies revealed that oceanographic patterns obtained by SOM were not sensitive to shortening of time series, to removal of data from one station or to removal of DO from the analysis. Simultaneous SOM-based mapping of sea surface heights in the northern Ionian Sea, with these heights serving as a proxy for the Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System (BiOS), revealed asymmetry between anticyclonic and cyclonic BiOS patterns and correlated the decadal oscillations in the middle Adriatic with the reversals in the BiOS circulation regimes. These reversals are found to either rapidly change oceanographic properties in the middle Adriatic (e.g. during the Eastern Mediterranean Transient), or to change them with a time lag of 2-3 years. The mapped connections may be used for a short-time (a few years) forecasting of the Adriatic oceanographic properties or for mapping future climate decadal oscillations as seen by ocean climate models.

        "description": "\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the quality of an ocean reanalysis will depend not only on the ocean data assimilation system, but also on the availability of observational data. Among the data assimilated in the tropical Pacific, observations from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) moored array are an important contributor. Due to various reasons, in the last couple of years, TAO had a very low data delivery rate at some of the mooring sites. In this work, we examined the influence of the availability of in-situ TAO data from all ten equatorial mooring sites in 1999-2014 by comparing ocean temperature from two data assimilation systems at National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP): the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Our working hypothesis is that missing of in-situ observational data should lead to less observational constraint, and consequently, larger divergence between ocean reanalyses. Compared with periods of no in-situ TAO observations, the disagreements of ocean temperature between CFSR and GODAS are indeed smaller when in-situ TAO observations are available. The disagreements are largest along the thermocline due to its being the region of strongest variability. Thus, it is suggested that without the constraint of in-situ TAO observations, the inconsistency between the ocean reanalyses from two NCEP data assimilation systems is larger, highlighting the contribution of TAO observations. Moreover, it is also suggested that the disagreement of ocean temperature between GODAS and CFSR is mainly caused by the difference of the models used in the assimilation systems and the impact of in-situ TAO availability plays a secondary, but important role. To improve the quality of the assimilation products, it is necessary both to reduce model bias and to assimilate more high quality data. This article is protected by copyright.

We demonstrated using a high-resolution biophysical model that vertical mixing alone resulted only in weak asymmetry after the passage of the storm. The enhanced bloom was caused instead by decreased turbulence due to re-stratification by sub-mesoscale recirculation cells preferentially produced on the right side, rightward shift of cool isotherms, and spin-up of a subsurface jet. We showed using a two-time scale asymptotic expansion that these slower evolving features were forced by resonance Reynolds stresses of the energetic and rapidly oscillating near-inertial internal waves.

        "description": "\n\nIncipient motion experiments were conducted with natural gravel, acetate beads and coarse gravel-sized electronic grains called Smart Sediment Grains in a Small-Oscillatory Flow Tunnel. Measurements of fluid velocity were made using Particle Image Velocimetry. The strength of the fluid shear stresses and the pressure gradients were examined for a range of oscillatory flow conditions at the onset of motion of the sediment particles to determine which mechanism had induced particle motion. The three sediment types utilized in these experiments facilitated an assessment of the effects of sediment grain size diameter, shape and density on incipient motion. Results suggested that the onset of sediment motion was dominated by the pressure gradients for flows with small orbital excursion amplitudes, by the shear stresses for flows with large orbital excursion amplitudes and by the combined effects for intermediate flows. The denser, angular gravel required greater free-stream accelerations to trigger sediment motion than the spherical, less dense acetate beads and Smart Sediment Grains. A combined parameter for incipient motion that accounts for the simultaneous effects of both shear stresses and pressure gradients while depending on the static coefficient of friction and the packing concentration of the mobile bed layer was evaluated for accuracy using a range of sediment types. The results suggested that the combined parameter may be a better indicator of sediment mobilization under oscillatory flows than the typically assumed shear stress criterion.

        "description": "\n\nDecadal salinity variability is an important characteristic of the ocean. It characterizes differences in evaporative and precipitation fluxes at the surface, and in the subsurface it contributes to steric sea level change and freshwater/salt transports. In this paper, we identify and describe westward moving and decadally-varying salinity anomalies within the thermocline of the tropical South Indian Ocean (SIO) based on ocean state estimates from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 2.2.4 (SODA). This signature in the salinity anomalies is expressed at the depth of 20\u00b0C isotherm (D20). A two-dimensional radon transform quantifies the westward speeds as being between 0.4\u20131.7 cm s\u22121. These speeds are slower than those of first baroclinic-mode Rossby waves or mean advection speeds of the background flow in the same regions. The decadal salinity anomaly originates in the subtropical eastern SIO (\u223c 39% of the variance explained) and merges with remote anomalies from the western tropical Pacific Ocean (WTPO) via the Indonesian Seas (\u223c 11% of the variance explained). The eastern SIO displays both decadal (\u223c 10\u201315 years) and interdecadal (\u223c 15\u201330 years) variability influenced by the WTPO, whereas the decadal variability in the western SIO seems to be more influenced by signals originating in the subtropical eastern SIO. We conclude that these salinity anomalies are consistent with signatures of non-linear baroclinic disturbances as explained in the recent literature, and possible interaction of higher order baroclinic-mode Rossby waves with the mean flow.

These data suggest that along one side of the iceberg, wind forcing leads to Ekman transport away from the iceberg, which causes upwelling of the cool saline water from below. The upwelling water mixes with the water above the thermocline, causing the mixed layer to become cooler and more saline. Along the opposite side of the iceberg, the surface Ekman transport moves towards the iceberg, which causes a sharpening of the thermocline as warm fresh water is trapped near the surface. This results in higher mixed layer temperatures and lower mixed layer salinities on this side of the iceberg. Based on these in situ measurements, we hypothesize that the asymmetries in water properties around the iceberg, caused by the opposing effects of upwelling and sharpening of the thermocline, lead to differential deterioration around the iceberg. Analysis of satellite imagery around iceberg PII-B-1 over a six month monitoring period reveals differential decay around the iceberg, in agreement with this mechanism.

Fluorescent Rhodamine WT dye, released near the shoreline continuously for 6.5 h, is advected alongshore by breaking wave- and wind-driven currents, and ejected offshore from the surfzone to the inner-shelf by transient rip currents. Novel aerial-based multispectral dye concentration images and in situ measurements of dye, waves, and currents provide tracer transport and dilution observations spanning about 350 m cross-shore and 3 km alongshore. Downstream dilution of near-shoreline dye follows power law decay with exponent -0.33, implying that a 10-fold increase in alongshore distance reduces the concentration about 50%. Coupled surfzone and inner-shelf dye mass balances close, and in 5 h roughly 1/2 of the surfzone-released dye is transported offshore to the inner-shelf. Observed cross-shore transports are parameterized well using a bulk exchange velocity and mean surfzone to inner-shelf dye concentration difference (r2 = 0.85, best fit slope = 0.7). The best fit cross-shore exchange velocity u*=1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 ms\u22121 is similar to a temperature-derived exchange velocity on another day with similar wave conditions. The u* magnitude and observed inner-shelf dye length scales, time scales, and vertical structure indicate the dominance of transient rip currents in surfzone to inner-shelf cross-shore exchange during moderate waves at this alongshore-uniform beach.

The granular model presented is based on simplified momentum equations for ice floe motion between collisions and on the resolution of linear complementarity problems to deal with ice floe collisions. Between collisions, the motion of an individual ice floe satisfies the linear and angular momentum conservation equations, with classical formulae applied to account for atmospheric and oceanic skin drag. To deal with collisions, before they lead to interpenetration, we included a linear complementarity problem based on the Signorini condition and Coulombs law. The nature of the contact is described through a constant coefficient of friction \u03bc, as well as a coefficient of restitution (0\u2264\u025b\u22641) describing the loss of kinetic energy during the collision. In the present version of our model, this coefficient is fixed. The model was validated using data obtained from the motion of interacting artificial wood floes in a test basin. The results of simulations comprising few hundreds ice floes of various shapes and sizes, exposed to different forcing scenarios and under different configurations, are also discussed. They show that the progressive clustering of ice floes as the result of kinetic energy dissipation during collisions is well-captured, and suggest a collisional regimes of floe dispersion at small scales, different from a large scale regime essentially driven by wind forcing.

        "description": "\n\nSnow is a principal factor in controlling heat and light fluxes through sea ice. With the goal of improving radiative and heat flux estimates through sea ice in regional and global models without the need of detailed snow property descriptions, a new parameterisation including subgrid-scale snow thickness variability is presented. One-parameter snow thickness distributions depending only on the gridbox-mean snow thickness are introduced resulting in analytical solutions for the fluxes of heat and light through the snow layer. As the snow pack melts, these snow thickness distributions ensure a smooth seasonal transition of the light field under sea ice. Spatially homogenous melting applied to an inhomogeneous distribution of snow thicknesses allows the appearance of bare sea ice areas and melt ponds before all snow has melted. In comparison to uniform-thickness snow used in previous models the bias in the under sea ice light field is halved with this parameterisation. Model results from a one-dimensional ocean turbulence model coupled with a thermodynamic sea ice model are compared to observations near Resolute in the Canadian High Arctic.

In the North Atlantic, the distribution of sea level change is more due to the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing, whereas it is more due to the \u201cwind\u201d forcing in the North Pacific; in the Southern Ocean, the \u201cthermal\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d forcing have a comparable influence. In the ocean adjacent to Antarctica the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing leads to an inflow of warmer waters on the continental shelves, which is somewhat attenuated by the \u201cwind\u201d forcing. The structure of the vertically-integrated heat uptake is set by different processes at low and high latitudes: at low latitudes it is dominated by the heat transport convergence, whereas at high latitudes it represents a small residual of changes in the surface flux and advection of heat. The structure of the horizontally-integrated heat content tendency is set by the increase of downward heat flux by the mean circulation and comparable decrease of upward heat flux by the subgrid-scale processes; the upward eddy heat flux decreases and increases by almost the same magnitude in response to, respectively, the \u201cthermal\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d forcing. Regionally, the surface heat loss and deep convection weaken in the Labrador Sea, but intensify in the Greenland Sea in the region of sea ice retreat. The enhanced heat flux anomaly in the subpolar Atlantic is mainly caused by the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nFlemish Pass, located at the western subpolar margin, is a passage (sill depth 1200 m) that is constrained by the Grand Banks and the underwater plateau Flemish Cap. In addition to the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) pathway offshore of Flemish Cap, Flemish Pass represents another southward transport pathway for two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), the lightest component of North Atlantic Deep Water carried with the DWBC. This pathway avoids potential stirring regions east of Flemish Cap and deflection into the interior North Atlantic. Ship based velocity measurements between 2009 and 2013 at 47\u00b0N in Flemish Pass and in the DWBC east of Flemish Cap revealed a considerable southward transport of Upper LSW through Flemish Pass (15 - 27%, -1.0 to -1.5 Sv). About 98% of the denser Deep LSW were carried around Flemish Cap as Flemish Pass is too shallow for considerable transport of Deep LSW. Hydrographic time series from ship-based measurements show a significant warming of 0.3\u00b0C/decade and a salinification of 0.03/decade of the Upper LSW in Flemish Pass between 1993 and 2013. Almost identical trends were found for the evolution in the Labrador Sea and in the DWBC east of Flemish Cap. This indicates that the long-term hydrographic variability of Upper LSW in Flemish Pass as well as in the DWBC at 47\u00b0N is dominated by changes in the Labrador Sea, which are advected southward. Fifty years of numerical ocean model simulations in Flemish Pass suggest that these trends are part of a multi-decadal cycle. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Coriolis-Stokes (CS) force is a wave-induced forcing of the Eulerian mean motion in a rotating ocean. For idealized conditions it is demonstrated by comparison with Lagrangian results that the appropriate surface boundary condition for the Eulerian mean wave-induced flow is that of vanishing vertical shear. The Eulerian mean current derived by applying this condition plus the inviscid Stokes drift yield the Lagrangian wave-induced drift velocity, apart from a small boundary-layer correction. Appreciation of the importance of the CS force in the momentum balance has led to investigations of the role of the CS force in the energy budget. The present study shows that the CS force is not a source for the rate of change of the total average energy density in the fluid, when the vertical integration is performed to the moving material surface. However, results to forth order in wave steepness confirm earlier findings that the CS force acts to change the vertically-integrated Eulerian kinetic energy of the mean flow. A new interpretation relates this effect to the fact that the mean Eulerian Coriolis force performs work in acting along the motion of the Lagrangian wave-induced mass (caused by the divergence effect) at the surface.

        "description": "\n\nThe California Current System is an eastern boundary upwelling system (EBUS) with high biological production along the coast. Oligotrophic offshore waters create cross-shore gradients of biological and physical properties, which are affected by intense mesoscale eddy activity. The influence of eddies on ecosystem dynamics in EBUSs is still in debate. To elucidate the mechanisms that influence the dynamics of ecosystems trapped in eddies, and the relative contribution of horizontal and vertical advection in determining local production, we analyze a particular cyclonic eddy using Lagrangian particle-tracking analyses of numerical Eulerian. The eddy formed in a coastal upwelling system; coastal waters trapped in the eddy enabled it to leave the upwelling region with high concentrations of plankton and nutrients. The ecosystem was initially driven mainly by recycling of biological material. As the eddy moved offshore, production in its core was enhanced compared to eddy exterior waters through Ekman pumping of nitrate from below the euphotic zone; this Ekman pumping was particularly effective due to the shallow nitracline in the eddy compared to eddy exterior waters. Both eddy trapping and Ekman pumping helped to isolate and maintain the ecosystem productivity in the eddy core. This study shows the importance of cyclonic eddies for biological production in EBUS: they contribute both to the redistribution of the coastal upwelling ecosystem and are local regions of enhanced new production. Together, these processes impact cross-shore gradients of important biological properties. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

The coastal mean annual amplitude of the seasonal cycle varies between zero and 24 cm, reaching a maximum between July and January. The maximum mean semi-annual amplitude is 7 cm, peaking between March and June. Along the coast, the seasonal cycle accounts for up to 92% of the mean monthly sea level variability. Atmospheric pressure explains a significant portion of the seasonal cycle with dominant annual signals in the northern SCS, the Gulf of Thailand and the north-western Philippines Sea. The wind forcing is dominant on the shelf areas of the SCS and the Gulf of Thailand where a simple barotropic model forced by the local wind shows annual amplitudes of up to 27 cm. In the deep basin of the SCS, the Philippines Sea and the shallow Malacca Strait, the steric component is the major contributor with the maximum annual amplitudes reaching 15 cm. Significant variability in the seasonal cycle is found on a year-to-year basis. The annual and semi-annual amplitudes vary by up to 63% and 45% of the maximum values, 15 cm and 11 cm, respectively. On average, stepwise regression analysis of contribution of different forcing factors accounts for 66% of the temporal variability of the annual cycle. The zonal wind was found to exert considerable influence in the Malacca Strait. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Sea surface temperature data were retrieved from AVHRR satellite imagery and from a realistic ROMS numerical simulation. The development and variability of the observed filaments were characterized and analyzed during each upwelling season of the ten year period. Filaments were generally found anchored to the main bathymetric and coastal features but off the more regular northern coast of the Western Iberian Margin their locations were more variable. The results from the modeling analysis reproduced well the general features of filament development. Moreover results of model and observation showed very similar characteristics as those found in the earlier study of Haynes et al [1993]. The model output was used to relate filament patterns, eddy activity and wind forcing. There was a clear relation between upwelling-favorable wind strength and number and length of filaments, although the relation was weaker in the north of the region. Model filaments were clearly related to eddies only during periods of weak winds. The filament detection method was also applied to a climatologically forced ROMS simulation, which reproduced only gross features of the observed and interannually forced model filament development. This suggests that direct wind forcing and its spatial structure are highly important. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

To determine the relative importance of these and their dependence on background flow conditions, we examine a much longer (6-month) dataset from a moored ADCP/thermistor chain with 2-m vertical spacing in which over 600 NLIWs are detected. Turbulent properties of the 318 waves with detectable overturning instabilities are documented using Thorpe scales. 130 waves detected while an ADCP was functioning are classified based on a Froude number criterion (Fr=, where u is velocity in the wave propagation direction, c is the wave phase speed). Of these, 108 waves are identified as shear-instability (Type I; Fr <1) waves and 22 as convective-instability (Type II; Fr >1). Composites are constructed by averaging in a wave coordinate frame over all waves in each category, showing the mean spatial structure of dissipation and other wave quantities. Turbulence is highest at the sheared interface for Type I waves and throughout the wave core for Type II waves. No relationship between wave instability mechanisms and wave/background parameters such as wave steepness, stratification or mean flow is found, except that unstable waves tend to be more energetic, demonstrating a need to better understand wave propagation and breaking in complex and variable coastal oceanographic background flows.

We present a survey of temperature, salinity, O2, pH, and currents at intermediate depths (defined here as 50\u2013500 m) in the summer (June 30 to July 10) and winter (December 8 to 15) of 2012 in the southern region of the Southern California Bight. Observations of temperature, salinity, and currents reveal that local bathymetry and small gyres play an important role in the flow path of the California Undercurrent (CU). Using spiciness (\u03c0) as a tracer, we observe a 10% increase of Pacific Equatorial Water (PEW) in the core of the CU during the summer versus the winter. This is associated with an increase in \u03c0 of 0.2, and a decrease in O2 and pH of 30 \u00b5mol kg\u22121 and 0.022, respectively; the change in pH is driven by increased CO2, while total alkalinity remains unchanged. The high-\u03c0, low-O2, low-pH waters during the summer are not distributed uniformly in the study region. Moreover, mooring observations at the edge of the continental shelf reveal intermittent intrusions of PEW onto the shelf with concomitant decreases in O2 and pH. We estimate that increased advection of PEW in the CU could account for approximately 50% of the observed decrease in O2, and between 49 and 73% of the decrease in pH, over the past three decades.

        "description": "\n\nWaves and current processes, both surface and near-bed were simulated for major storms on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland using integrated wave, 3D tidal and ocean current models. Most storms track southwest to northeast and pass to the north or northwest of the Grand Banks. Significant wave heights can reach up to \u223c14 m and are predominantly to the northeast at the peak of storms. Extreme surface currents reach approximately 1 m s\u22121 and are largely to the southeast. The strongest bottom currents, up to 0.8 m s\u22121, occur on St. Pierre Bank and are dominantly to the south and southeast. While wave height and wind-driven current generally increase with wind speed, factors such as storm paths, the relative location of the storm center at the storm peak, and storm translation speed also affect waves and currents. Surface and near-bed wind-driven currents both rotate clockwise and decrease in strength as the storm traverses the Grand Banks. While the spatial variability of the storm impact on surface currents is relatively small, bottom currents show significant spatial variation of magnitude and direction as well as timing of peak current conditions. These spatial variations are controlled by the changes of bathymetry and mixed layer depth over the model domain. The storm-generated currents can be 7 to 10 times stronger than the background mean currents. These strong currents interact with wave oscillatory flows to produce shear velocities up to 15 cm s\u22121 and cause wide occurrences of strong sediment transport over nearly the entire Grand Banks.

The IW is defined as the water mass with a local salinity minimum along the Kuroshio path. An empirical formula is developed to estimate the IW salinity minimum east of Taiwan using temperature measurements around 580-m depth. Properties of the IW east of Taiwan vary greatly as a result of variable contributions from three water masses including the high salinity South China Sea Intermediate Water (SCSIW), the low salinity North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), and the intermediate salinity Kuroshio Intermediate Water (KIW). Our analysis concludes that NPIW is predominantly found east of Taiwan and the northward transport of KIW from northeast of Luzon to east of Taiwan is not a steady process. Concurrent mooring measurements at these two locations enable us to correlate the variations of the layer thickness of the Kuroshio near its origin (KLTo) northeast of Luzon to the nature of the IW east of Taiwan. When the Kuroshio is deep, i.e. large KLTo, KIW is transported northward across the Luzon Strait, where its salinity increases presumably due to turbulence mixing with SCSIW. This modified KIW is then transported to the east of Taiwan. When the Kuroshio is shallow, i.e. small KLTo, the KIW transport east of Luzon is nil or southward. East of Taiwan, NPIW feeds in below the Kuroshio and is transported northward beyond the I-Lan Ridge. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

The forcing data includes the most complete compilation of Baltic river loads for dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and total alkalinity (TA). In addition, we apply the most recent estimates of internal TA generation in the system. Our results clearly demonstrate how air-water CO2 fluxes of a coastal sea depend on river loads of carbon, TA and nutrients as well the freshwater import itself. Long-term changes in DIC loads are shown to be compensated by corresponding changes in air-water CO2 exchange. By adding Aorg, a discrepancy in the carbonate system calculations was removed, and the simulated net CO2 absorption of the system decreased by 11%. A new parameterization for cyanobacteria growth significantly improved the seasonal development of pCO2 in the central Baltic Sea, although the net effect on CO2 fluxes was below 5%. By applying either a linear, quadratic, or cubic wind speed dependence for gas transfer, the long-term net CO2 exchange was adjusted by less than 5%. There is no clear indication that any one of these parameterizations provides a more accurate estimate of CO2 fluxes than the other two.

Here, we address this gap using a high-resolution (5 km) coupled physical-biogeochemical numerical simulation (ROMS). The results reveal (i) that the offshore transport is a very substantial component of any material budget in this region, (ii) that it reaches more than 800 kilometers into the offshore domain, and (iii) that this transport is largely controlled by mesoscale processes, involving filaments and westward propagating eddies. The process starts in the nearshore areas, where nutrient and organic matter-rich upwelled waters pushed offshore by Ekman transport are subducted at the sharp lateral density gradients of upwelling fronts and filaments located at \u223c25-100 km from the coast. The filaments are very effective in transporting the subducted material further offshore until they form eddies at their tips at about 100-200 km from the shore. The cyclonic eddies tend to trap the cold, nutrient and organic matter-rich waters of the filaments, whereas the anticyclones formed nearby encapsulate the low nutrient and low organic matter waters around the filament. After their detachment, both types of eddies propagate further in offshore direction, with a speed similar to that of the first baroclinic mode Rossby waves, providing the key mechanism for long-range transport of nitrate and organic matter from the coast deep into the offshore environment.

The gravity current splits at the density step, and the portion of the buoyancy flux becoming an interflow is largely controlled by the vertical distribution of velocity and density within the gravity current and the magnitude of the density step between the two ambient layers. This is in agreement with recent laboratory observations. The strongest changes in the ambient density profiles occur as a result of the impingement of supercritical currents with strong density contrasts, for which a large portion of the gravity current detaches from the bottom and becomes an interflow. We characterize the current partition process in the simulated experiments using the densimetric Froude number of the current (Fr) across the density step (upstream and downstream). When underflows are formed, more supercritical currents are observed downstream of the density step compared to upstream (Fru\u2009<\u2009Frd), and thus, stronger mixing of the current with the ambient water downstream. However, when split flows and interflows are formed, smaller Fr values are identified after the current crosses the density step (Fru\u2009>\u2009Frd), which indicates lower mixing between the current and ambient water after the impingement due to the significant stripping of interfacial material at the density step.

The objectives of this study are to document our recent modeling experiences on the simulation of the lake thermal structure and to explore underlying dynamic explanations of the observed modeling success. In this study, we use a three dimensional hydrodynamic model (FVCOM - Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) and an assimilative weather forecasting model (WRF - Weather Research and Forecasting Model) to study the annual heating and cooling cycle of Lake Superior. Model experiments are carried out with meteorological forcing based on interpolation of surface weather observations, on WRF and on Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis data, respectively. Model performance is assessed through comparison with satellite products and in-situ measurements. Accurate simulations of the lake thermal structure are achieved through 1) adapting the COARE algorithm in the hydrodynamic model to derive instantaneous estimates of latent/sensible heat fluxes and upward longwave radiation based on prognostic surface water temperature simulated within the model as opposed to pre-computing them with an assumed surface water temperature; 2) estimating incoming solar radiation and downward longwave radiation based on meteorological measurements as opposed to meteorological model-based estimates; 3) using the weather forecasting model to provide high-resolution dynamically-constrained wind fields as opposed to wind fields interpolated from station observations. Analysis reveals that the key to the modeling success is to resolve the lake-atmosphere interactions and apply appropriate representations of different meteorological forcing fields, based on the nature of their spatiotemporal variability. The close agreement between model simulation and observations also suggests that the 3-D hydrodynamic model can provide reliable spatiotemporal estimates of heat budgets over Lake Superior and similar systems. Although there have been previous studies which analyzed the impact of the spatiotemporal variability of overwater wind fields on lake circulation, we believe this is the first detailed analysis of the importance of spatiotemporal variability of heat flux components on hydrodynamic simulation of 3-D thermal structure in a lake.

Our most striking findings are: i) limited within their critical latitudes, the wave extrema coincide with a significant number of vortices; ii) eddy\u2013wave coincidence occurs at a preferred latitude that depends on the wave period; iii) among the vortices that, at some point of their existence coincide with a wave, a relatively large percentage of them remained their whole lifetime with the wave, and iv) a mechanism is proposed to explain why eddies tend to remain over the wave extrema (crests and troughs). Our answer to the title question is: yes, they often do. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nAntarctic coastal polynyas are biologically rich ecosystems that support large populations of mammals and birds and are globally significant sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide. To support local phytoplankton blooms, these highly productive ecosystems require a large input of iron (Fe), the sources of which are poorly known. Here we assess the relative importance of six different environmental factors in controlling the amount of phytoplankton biomass and rates of net primary production (NPP) in 46 coastal polynyas around Antarctica. Data presented here suggest that melting ice shelves are a primary supplier of Fe to coastal polynyas, with basal melt rates explaining 58% of the between-polynya variance in mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. In a multiple regression analysis, which explained 78% of the variance in chlorophyll a (Chl a) between polynyas, basal melt rate explained twice as much of the variance as the next most important variable. Fe upwelled from sediments, which is partly controlled by continental shelf width, was also important in some polynyas. Of secondary importance to phytoplankton abundance and NPP were sea surface temperature and polynya size. Surprisingly, differences in light availability and the length of the open water season explained little or none of the variance in either Chl a or NPP between polynyas. If the productivity of coastal polynyas is indeed sensitive to the release of Fe from melting ice shelves, future changes in ice shelf melt rates could dramatically influence Antarctic coastal ecosystems and the ability of continental shelf waters to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide.

        "description": "\n\nResults from an Ice Stress Buoy deployed near the center of a multiyear floe in the Viscount Melville Sound of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago between 10 October 2010 and 17 August 2011 are presented. The position record indicates the landlocked season was approximately 5 months, from 18 January to 22 June, when the sea ice was fast to Melville Island and Victoria Island. Thermal stresses (ranging from -84 to 66 kPa) dominate the internal stress record, with only a few dynamic stress events (\u223c50 kPa) recorded before the landlocked season. Intriguingly, the thermal stresses are isotropic before the landlocked ice onset and anisotropic during the landlocked season. Two possible causes to explain anisotropy in thermal stresses are considered: preferred c-axis alignment of the ice crystal, and land confinement associated with the nearby coastline. The orientation of the principal stresses indicates that land confinement is responsible for the anisotropy. The stress record also clearly shows the presence of residual compressive stresses at the melt onset, suggesting a viscous creep relaxation time constant of several days. Finally, results show an interesting reversal in the sign of the correlation (from negative to positive) between surface air temperature and thermal stress after the onset of surface melt. We attribute this to the onset of water infiltration within sea ice after which colder night temperature leads to re-freezing and compressive stresses. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that anisotropic thermal stresses have been reported in sea ice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe equatorial Indian Ocean is characterized by strong eastward flows in the upper 80-100 m during boreal spring and fall referred to as the Wyrtki jets. These jets are driven by westerly winds during the transition seasons between the southwest and northeast monsoons and represent a major conduit for mass and heat transfer between the eastern and western sides of the basin. Since their discovery over 40 years ago, there have been very few estimates from direct observations of the volume transports associated with these currents. In this paper we describe seasonal-to-interannual time scale variations in volume transports based on 5 years of unique measurements from an array of acoustic Doppler current profilers in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. The array was centered at 0\u00b0, 80.5\u00b0E and spanned latitudes between 2.5\u00b0N and 4\u00b0S from August 2008 to December 2013. Analysis of these data indicates that the spring jet peaks in May at 14.9\u00b12.9 Sv and the fall jet peaks in November at 19.7\u00b12.4 Sv, around which there are year-to-year transport variations of 5-10 Sv. The relationship of the interannual transport variations to zonal wind stress forcing, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and surface current variations associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are further highlighted. We also illustrate the role of wind-forced equatorial waves in affecting transport variations of the fall Wyrtki jet during the peak season of the IOD. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nA three-dimensional sea ice model is presented with resolved snow thickness variations and melt ponds. The model calculates heating from solar radiative transfer and simulates the formation and movement of brine/melt water through the ice system. Initialization for the model is based on observations of snow topography made during the summer melt seasons of 2009, 2010, and 2012 from a location off the coast of Barrow, AK. Experiments are conducted to examine the importance of snow properties and snow and ice thickness by comparing observed and modeled pond fraction and albedo.\nOne key process simulated by the model is the formation of frozen layers in the ice as relatively warm fresh water grid cells freeze when cooled by adjacent, cold brine-filled grid cells. These layers prevent vertical drainage and lead to flooding of melt water commonly observed at the beginning of the melt season. Flooding persists until enough heat is absorbed to melt through the frozen layer. The resulting long-term melt pond coverage is sensitive to both the spatial variability of snow cover and the minimum snow depth. For thin snow cover, initial melting results in earlier, reduced flooding with a small change in pond fraction after drainage of the melt water. Deeper snow tends to generate a delayed, larger peak pond fraction before drainage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Terra satellite ASTER imagery reveals a sediment color front emerging from Nanjemoy Creek when the Potomac is near maximum ebb. Nearly contemporaneous ASTER and Landsat ETM+ imagery are used to extract surface velocities, which suggest a velocity shear front is collocated with the color front. In-situ velocities (measured by RiverRay traverses near the Nanjemoy Creek mouth) confirm the shear front's presence.\nA finite-element simulation (using ADCIRC) replicates the observed velocity-shear front and is applied to decipher its physics. Three results emerge: 1.) The velocity-shear front forms, confined to a shoal downstream of the creek-river confluence for most of the tidal cycle, 2.) A simulation with a flat bottom in Nanjemoy Creek and Potomac River (i.e., no bathymetry variation) indicates the velocity-shear front never forms, hence the front cannot exist without the bathymetry, and 3.) An additional simulation with a blocked-off Creek entrance demonstrates that while the magnitude of the velocity-shear is largely unchanged without the creek, shear front formation is delayed in time. Without the Creek there is no advection of the M6 tidal constituent (generated by nonlinear interaction of the flow with bottom friction) onto the shoals, only a locally generated contribution. A tidal phase difference between Nanjemoy and Potomac causes the ebbing Nanjemoy Creek waters to intrude into the Potomac as far south as its deep channel, and draw from a similar location in the Potomac during Nanjemoy flood.

To assess the error statistics of two low-resolution Eulerian ice drift products, we use high-resolution Lagrangian ice motion derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The Lagrangian trajectories from the SAR data are converted to an Eulerian format to serve as reference for the error assessment of the Eulerian products. The statistical error associated with the conversion is suppressed to an acceptable level by applying a threshold for averaging. By using the SAR ice drift as a reference, we formulate the uncertainty of monthly mean ice drift as an empirical function of drift speed and ice concentration. The empirical functions are applied to derive uncertainty maps of Arctic ice drift fields. The estimated uncertainty maps reasonably capture an increase of uncertainty with the progress of summer melting season. The uncertainties range from 1.0 cm s\u22121 to 2.0 cm s\u22121, which indicates that the low-resolution Eulerian products for summer seasons are of practical use for climate studies, model validation and data assimilation, if their uncertainties are appropriately taken into account.

Geographic variability of bottom pressure is in general smaller than variability of sea level, particularly at equatorial sites. However, existing bottom pressure recorder technology suffers from drift of several cm/yr, too much for practical realization of these purposes. Therefore, we investigate the use of a tall hydrographic mooring to detect trends in ocean bottom pressure, using data from the Rapid experiment in the North Atlantic. The accuracy of the method is dependent on the number of instruments on the mooring, and we demonstrate how an ocean model (in our case NEMO) can be used to provide an estimate of accuracy of this technique and hence guide mooring design. We also show how it is also dependent on the operational calibration of instruments. We find that, together with altimetry and sea-surface temperatures, such a mooring can be used to provide bottom pressure variations to within about 1 mbar (1 cm sea level). We estimate that an optimally calibrated mooring in the North Atlantic could detect a trend in bottom pressure to an accuracy of \u00b11 mm/yr after approximately 12 years of operation.\n",

Here skewness of sea level anomaly (SLA) from 1992 to 2013 is coupled with a meandering Gaussian jetw model to estimate the mean position, meridional width, and the percent variance that each front contributes to total SLA variability. The SAF and PF have comparable widths (85 km) in the circumpolar average, but their widths differ significantly in the East Pacific Basin (85 and 60 km, respectively). Interannual variability in the positions of the SAF and PF are also estimated using annual subsets of the SLA data from 1993 to 2012. The PF position has enhanced variability near strong topographic features such as the Kerguelen Plateau, the Campbell Plateau east of New Zealand, and downstream of Drake Passage. Neither the SAF nor the PF showed a robust meridional trend over the 20 year period. The Southern Annular Mode was significantly correlated with basin-averaged SAF and PF positions in the East Pacific and with the PF south of Australia. A correlation between the PF and the basin-scale wind stress curl anomaly was also found in the western extratropical Pacific but not in other basins.\n",

Sixty ensemble members are generated by adding realistic noise to the forcing parameters related to the temperature. The ensemble is diagnosed and validated by comparison between the ensemble spread and the model/observation difference, as well as by rank histogram before the assimilation experiments. An incremental analysis update scheme is applied in order to reduce spurious oscillations due to the model state correction. The results of the assimilation are assessed according to both deterministic and probabilistic metrics with independent/semiindependent observations. For deterministic validation, the ensemble means, together with the ensemble spreads are compared to the observations, in order to diagnose the ensemble distribution properties in a deterministic way. For probabilistic validation, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is used to evaluate the ensemble forecast system according to reliability and resolution. The reliability is further decomposed into bias and dispersion by the reduced centered random variable (RCRV) score in order to investigate the reliability properties of the ensemble forecast system. The improvement of the assimilation is demonstrated using these validation metrics. Finally, the deterministic validation and the probabilistic validation are analyzed jointly.

The analysis is based on a combination of in situ SSS observations collected in the last three decades from voluntary observing ships, TAO/TRITON and PIRATA moorings, Argo floats, and (few) CTD profiles. The mean latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific low SSS waters appear 1\u00b0\u20133\u00b0 further poleward than the Evaporation minus Precipitation (E-P) minima linked to the Inter Tropical Convergence Zones (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ).

On the other hand, the seasonal displacements of E-P and SSS minima are in antiphase in the central and western parts of the Pacific ITCZ. At the interannual time scale, the E-P and SSS minima migrate poleward during La Nina events in the Pacific and during the positive phase of the Atlantic Meridional Dipole (AMD) in the Atlantic (and vice versa during El Nino and the negative phase of the AMD).

Here we present data from an oceanographic mooring deployed on the eastern flank of the SAT from September 2009 to September 2010 as well as CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) sections across the SAT. A distinct vertical density front over the SAT eastern slope deeper than \u223c50 m is attributed to the outflow of Barents Sea branch water to the Arctic Ocean. In turn, the Barents Sea branch water flow to the Arctic Ocean is conditioned by two water masses defined by relative low and high fractions of the Atlantic Water. They are also traceable in the Nansen Basin downstream of the SAT entrance. A persistent northward current was recorded in the subsurface layer along the SAT eastern slope with a mean velocity of 18 cm s\u22121 at 134\u2013218 m and 23 cm s\u22121 at 376\u2013468 m. Observations and modeling suggest that the SAT flow has a significant density-driven component. It is therefore expected to respond to changes in the cross-trough density gradient conditioned by interaction between the Fram Strait and Barents Sea branches. Further modeling efforts are necessary to investigate hydrodynamic instability and eddy generation caused by the interaction between the SAT flow and the Arctic Ocean Fram Strait branch water boundary current.\n",

Most of the infragravity wave energy is trapped or dissipated near coastlines, but a small percentage escapes into the open oceans. The source of deep ocean infragravity waves is debated, specifically whether they come mostly from regions with strong source waves or from sites with particular morphologies/orientations. We correlate measurements of infragravity waves in the deep North Atlantic Ocean with infragravity wave generation parameters throughout the Atlantic Ocean to find the dominant sources of deep ocean infragravity wave energy in the North Atlantic Ocean. The deep ocean infragravity wave data are from a 5 year deployment of absolute pressure gauges west of the Azores islands (37\u00b0N, 35\u00b0W) and shorter data sets from seafloor tsunami gauges (DART buoys). Two main sources are identified: one off of the west coast of southern Europe and northern Africa (25\u00b0N\u201340\u00b0N) in northern hemisphere winter and the other off the west coast of equatorial Africa (the Gulf of Guinea) in southern hemisphere winter. These regions have relatively weak source waves and weak infragravity wave propagation paths to the main measurement site, indicating that that the site morphology/orientation dominates the creation of deep ocean infragravity waves. Both regions have also been identified as potential sources of global seismological noise, suggesting that the same mechanisms may be behind the generation of deep ocean infragravity waves and global seismological noise in the frequency band from 0.001 to 0.04 Hz.\n",

This process plays an important role in cross-shelf material exchange in the East China Sea (ECS), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study suggests that the penetrating fronts are the response of buoyant coastal water to along-isobath undulation of the ambient pycnocline that is controlled by the temperature stratification in seawater. When the ambient pycnocline descends sharply in the downshelf direction, coastal water is transported offshore due to the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief (JEBAR), and thus generates a penetrating front. Along-isobath pycnocline undulation in the ECS can arise from nonuniform tidal mixing due to tidal wave divergence off the Min-Zhe Coast. Onshelf intrusion of cold and dense Kuroshio subsurface water prevents thorough mixing of the pycnocline. Different from the common cross-shelf transport phenomena induced by winds or frontal instabilities, such a tidal mechanism should produce penetrating fronts at specific locations, in agreement with observations.\n",

However, few details are known regarding where, when, and how the freshwater transverses the vast Siberian shelf seas. This paper investigates the mechanism, variability, and pathways of the fresh Kara Sea outflow through Vilkitsky Strait toward the Laptev Sea. We utilize a high-resolution ocean model and recent shipboard observations to characterize the freshwater-laden Vilkitsky Strait Current (VSC), and shed new light on the little-studied region between the Kara and Laptev Seas, characterized by harsh ice conditions, contrasting water masses, straits, and a large submarine canyon. The VSC is 10\u201320 km wide, surface intensified, and varies seasonally (maximum from August to March) and interannually. Average freshwater (volume) transport is 500\u2009\u00b1\u2009120 km3 a\u22121 (0.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 Sv), with a baroclinic flow contribution of 50\u201390%. Interannual transport variability is explained by a storage-release mechanism, where blocking-favorable summer winds hamper the outflow and cause accumulation of freshwater in the Kara Sea. The year following a blocking event is characterized by enhanced transports driven by a baroclinic flow along the coast that is set up by increased freshwater volumes. Eventually, the VSC merges with a slope current and provides a major pathway for Eurasian river water toward the western Arctic along the Eurasian continental slope. Kara (and Laptev) Sea freshwater transport is not correlated with the Arctic Oscillation, but rather driven by regional summer pressure patterns.\n",

The reasons for preferential influence of certain remote excitation sites are explored by examining model time sequences of tsunami wave patterns emanating from the source. Distant bathymetric features in the West and Central Pacific can redirect tsunami energy into narrow paths with anomalously large wave height that have disproportionate impact on small areas of coastline. The source region generating the waves can be as little as 100 km along a subduction zone, resulting in distinct source-target pairs with sharply amplified wave energy at the target. Tsunami spectral ratios examined for transects near the source, after crossing the West Pacific, and on approach to the coast illustrate how prominent bathymetric features alter wave spectral distributions, and relate to both the timing and magnitude of waves approaching shore. To contextualize the potential impact of tsunamis from high-amplitude source-target pairs, the source characteristics of major historical earthquakes and tsunamis in 1960, 1964, and 2011 are used to generate comparable events originating at the highest-amplitude source locations for each coastal target. This creates a type of \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d a replicate of each region's historically largest earthquake positioned at the fault segment that would produce the most incoming tsunami energy at each target port.

        "description": "\n\nThe results of a 20 year high-resolution simulation that spans from 1989 to 2008 are analyzed to study the year-to-year changes of the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC), and its effects on the temperature and salinity variability on the Western Iberian Margin. The model results are compared with satellite data and with data measured at two moored multiparametric buoys. The model reproduces the events of strong sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies described in the literature, for the northern and western coasts, and it helps to explain the connection between the IPC intensity, temperature, and salinity. By analyzing some specific winters, with different characteristics, it is confirmed that years of stronger IPC result in higher transport of heat and salt, and the development of positive anomalies of temperature and salinity. However, local air-sea fluxes are also important and explain the temperature and salinity anomalies observed in some of the winters. The interplay between the IPC transport, or advection, and the local heat and salt fluxes explain why the temperature and salinity anomalies may be in antiphase or uncorrelated with the IPC magnitude. It is shown that from November to January, the IPC magnitude depends mostly on the intensity of the southerly winds, and it has a significant negative correlation with the NAO index.\n",

Conductivity, temperature, and depth profiles were collected during three summer field seasons (2011\u20132013), and two moorings were deployed during 2011\u20132012. Within the sound, salinity increases with increasing depth while water temperature cools reaching a minimum of \u22121.49\u00b0C at roughly 100 m. Below 100 m, the water becomes both warmer and saltier. Temperature-salinity curves for each year followed a similar pattern, but the entire water column in Cumberland Sound cooled from 2011 to 2012, and then warmed through the summer of 2013. Even though the sound's maximum depth is over a kilometer deeper than its sill, water in the entire sound is well oxygenated. A comparison of water masses within the sound and in Davis Strait shows that, above the sill, the sound is flooded with cold Baffin Island Current water following an intermittent geostrophic flow pattern entering the sound along the north coast and leaving along the south. Below the sill, replenishment is infrequent and includes water from both the Baffin Island Current and the West Greenland Current. Deep water replenishment occurred more frequently on spring tides, especially in the fall of 2011. Although the sound's circulation is controlled by outside currents, internal water modifying processes occur such as estuarine flow and wind-driven mixing.\n",

In spring 2011, we examined the distribution of dissolved Al in the East China Sea (ECS) to assess the potential passage of coastal water across the shelf to the western Pacific. Measurement of dissolved Al in coastal, shelf, and shelf break waters indicated decreasing concentrations with distance from the coast. However, the northward increase of dissolved Al in the upper 100 m along the shelf break transect, corresponding to the northward flow of Kuroshio Water along the Okinawa Trough from the north of Taiwan to the Tokara strait, indicates contributions of terrestrial material. The presence of an Al plume indicated cross-shelf transport at the subsurface at a potential density of 23.3\u201324.0 kg/m3. This plume originates from the near-bottom layer along the coast off Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, and first moves southeastward (to the north of Taiwan) and then northeastward (to shelf break with export at 29\u00b0N, 127\u00b0E). We calculated the cross-shelf fluxes of water and dissolved Al based on simulation results of the 3-D Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). The calculated cross-shelf fluxes of Al at the subsurface layer indicate that the ECS is highly efficient in pumping Al-rich coastal waters northward to the Japan Sea/East Sea and/or eastward into the western Pacific. We also identified an important role of the monsoon, with a change from northeasterly wind to southwesterly wind in spring, on the cross-shelf transport of Al by use of numerical tracer experiments.\n",

Unfortunately, because ship survey data are not synoptic, it is difficult to obtain spatially resolved estimates of the rates of change of tracers sampled in a moving fluid. Here we present a pseudo-Lagrangian transformation to remap data from underway surveys to a pseudo-synoptic view. The method utilizes geostrophic velocities to back advect and relocate sampling positions, removing advection aliasing. This algorithm produces a map of true relative sampling locations, and allows for determination of the relative locations of observations acquired along streamlines, as well as a corrected view of the tracer's spatial gradients. We then use a forward advection scheme to estimate the tracer's relative change along streamlines, and use these to calculate spatially resolved, net specific rates of change. Application of this technique to Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence data around an ocean front is presented. We obtain 156 individual estimates of Chl-a fluorescence net specific rate of change, covering \u223c1200 km2. After incorporating a diffusion-like model to estimate error, the method shows that the majority of observations (64%) were significantly negative. This pseudo-Lagrangian approach generates more accurate spatial maps than raw survey data, and allows spatially resolved estimates of net rates of tracer change. Such estimates can be used as a rate budget constraint that, in conjunction with standard rate measurements, will better determine biogeochemical fluxes.\n",

The average model transport of ULSW decreases southward from 6.7 Sv at 53\u00b0N to 4.5 Sv at 45\u00b0N due to interior pathways. The largest fraction of the total ULSW volume transport goes around Flemish Cap within the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC, 72%) but a significant part goes through Flemish Pass (20%). At interannual timescales, the variability at Flemish Pass shows a distinct behavior when compared to the variability in the DWBC and to the upstream fluctuations. A running correlation method is applied to obtain the connection of the transport variability at Flemish Pass with several quantities, representative for different physical mechanisms: (1) the North Atlantic Oscillation index, (2) the Ekman transport, (3) the rate of ULSW formation in the Labrador Sea, (4) the position of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) relative to the slope and (5) the averaged transport in the subpolar gyre. Weakened or strengthened transport of ULSW through Flemish Pass coincides with changes of the atmospheric forcing or with changes of the NAC\u2018s position. Strong meandering of the NAC close to the DWBC reduces the transport off Flemish Cap, and the ULSW flow is \u201credirected\u201d into the Flemish Pass, enhancing the transport there. In contrast, the transport variability in the DWBC is mainly caused by upstream fluctuations and changes according to the rate of ULSW formation.\n",

Here we use a three-dimensional circulation model coupled with a simple oxygen model to examine the physical controls on hypoxia generation on the LA shelf. The model assumes a constant oxygen utilization rate in the water column and a sediment oxygen consumption rate that depends on the bottom water oxygen concentration and temperature. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the observed variability of dissolved oxygen and hypoxia on the LA shelf, highlighting the importance of physical processes. Model results demonstrate that both river discharge and wind forcing have a strong effect on the distribution of the river plume and stratification, and thereby on bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations and hypoxia formation on the LA shelf. The seasonal cycle of hypoxia is relatively insensitive to the seasonal variability in river discharge, but the time-integrated hypoxic area is very sensitive to the overall magnitude of river discharge. Changes in wind speed have the greatest effect on the simulated seasonal cycle of hypoxia and hypoxic duration, while changes in wind direction strongly influence the geographic distribution of hypoxia. Given that our simple oxygen model essentially reproduces the evolution of hypoxia simulated with a full biogeochemical model and that physical processes largely determine the magnitude and distribution of hypoxia, a full biogeochemical model might not be necessary for short-term hypoxia forecasting.\n",

Over the satellite altimetry era, there have been numerous evidence that surface mesoscale eddies play an important role in the offshore transport of rich coastal waters, but it has been only recently that few observational/numerical studies have highlighted the importance of the subsurface eddies. The eddy field variability is explored using the results of a high-resolution model experiment from 1979 to 2012. The model results indicate an asymmetry of the surface and subsurface eddy fields. While surface-intensified cyclones are slightly more frequent than anticyclones, the subsurface field is dominated by anticyclones (IntrathermoclineEddies; ITEs), triggered by the instability of the subsurface Peru Chile undercurrent (PCUC). Composite maps are consistent with in situ observations. ITEs are associated with maximum vorticity around 150\u2013200 m depth, warmer and more saline core, characteristic of the equatorial subsurface water from the PCUC. We find that the variability of the ITEs is significantly correlated with the ENSO equatorial signal. During strong El Ni\u00f1o events (e.g., 1982; 1998), we find that while the PCUC transport increases, the volume of coastal waters transported by ITEs however decreases during those periods. We find that the relaxation of the isopycnals along the coast during El Ni\u00f1o events leads to weakened baroclinic instability and to a decrease of the ITEs transport.\n",

Results are compared with those obtained from the AVISO 19 year, 1/3\u00b0 gridded SLA space-time objective analysis, and associated geostrophic velocity anomalies. The study reveals that eddy variability appears to be Gaussian over most parts of the ocean, outside the influence of energetic current systems, and that specific flow regimes in the ocean can be identified through higher statistical moments of the flow field and SLA observations. However, the moment-ratio diagrams of skewness and kurtosis reveal that in energetic boundary currents the ocean does not follow Gaussian statistics, but rather behaves like an exponential distribution. Higher statistical moments of SLA and velocity anomalies do vary seasonally and thereby provide valuable information about the seasonal changes of the oceans' flow field.\n",

The highest satellite-sensed chlorophyll concentrations occur in the Strait of Georgia, where mean values are at least 2 times higher than elsewhere in the northeast Pacific. Moreover, the annual average surface chlorophyll concentration increased significantly in the Strait of Georgia during this period, with highest concentration observed during the near neutral ENSO conditions of the spring of 2007. The next highest concentrations occur off southwest Vancouver Island but have no statistically significant trend. The lowest average peak chlorophyll concentration is observed off Southern California.

Wave measurements within the Apostle Islands and offshore NOAA buoys were used to validate the model. Statistics of the significant wave height, peak wave period, and mean wave direction were computed to reveal the spatial variability of wave properties within the archipelago for average and extreme events. Extreme value analysis was performed to estimate the significant wave height at the 1, 10, and 100 year return periods. Significant wave heights in the interior areas of the islands vary spatially but are approximately half those immediately offshore of the islands. Due to reduced winter ice cover and a clockwise shift in wind direction over the hindcast period, long-term trend analysis indicates an increasing trend of significant wave heights statistics by as much as 2% per year, which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than similar analysis performed in the global ocean for areas unaffected by ice. Two scientific questions related to wave climate are addressed. First, the wave climate change due to the relative role of changing wind fields or ice covers over the past 35 years was revealed. Second, potential bluff erosion affected by the change of wave climate and the trend of lower water levels in the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior was examined.\n",

It is shown that the strongest inverse cascade occurs mostly in high-energy eastward-flowing currents, such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the Kuroshio Extension, and the Gulf Stream, which matches the global distribution pattern of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Hence, the eddy scales predicted by the local linear baroclinic instability \nLbci and from the altimeter observation \nLeddy are mapped out and compared with the energy injection scale \nLinj and the arrest-start scale \nLarrest\u2212start of the inverse cascade, respectively. Generally, \nLbci agrees well with \nLinj in the midlatitude and high-latitude oceans, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. \nLeddy falls within the arrest ranges of the inverse cascade and is quite close to \nLarrest\u2212start. Finally, the depth dependence and the anisotropy of the inverse kinetic energy cascade are also diagnosed in the global ocean. We have found that the strength of the inverse cascades decreases with increasing depth, but the global pattern of the strength is nearly invariable. Meanwhile, the variations in depth hardly affect the \nLinj and \nLarrest\u2212start. After considering the anisotropy in the spectral flux calculation, a possible inertial range for the zonal spectral kinetic energy flux is expected, where the cascade magnitude will keep a nearly constant negative value associated with the oceanic zonal jets.\n",

At this site, the flat and wide (\u223c1.4 km) reef platform is located slightly above mean sea level, such that during low tide the offshore water level can fall 4 m below the platform. While the reef always remained submerged over each tidal cycle, there were dramatic asymmetries in both the water levels and velocities on the reef, i.e., the flood duration lasted only \u223c2 h versus \u223c10 h for the ebb. These dynamics were investigated using a one-dimensional numerical model (SWASH) to solve the nonlinear shallow water equations with rapid (sub to supercritical) flow transitions. The numerical model revealed that as water drains off the reef, a critical flow point was established near the reef edge prior to the water discharging down the steep forereef. Despite this hydraulic control, bottom friction on the reef was still found to make a far greater contribution to elevating water levels on the reef platform and keeping it submerged over each tidal cycle. Finally, a simple analytical model more broadly shows how water levels on intertidal reef platforms functionally depend on properties of reef morphology, bottom roughness, and tidal conditions, revealing a set of parameters (a reef draining time-scale and friction parameter) that can be used to quantify how the water depth will fall on a reef during ebb tide.\n",

In the channels, drifter and subsurface current meter velocities are similar, consistent with strong vertical mixing and 2-D hydrodynamics. Drifters were preferentially entrained in the channelized jets where drifter cluster lateral spreading rates \n\u03bcin were small (\n\u03bcin\u22480.5\u2009m2\u2009s\u22121). At the seaward edge of the ebb shoal, jet velocities decrease linearly with distance (to \n\u22640.2\u2009m\u2009s\u22121, about 1 km from shore), and cluster spreading rates are larger with \n\u03bcout\u22483\u2009m2\u2009s\u22121. Although the models COAWST and NearCom generally reproduce the observed trajectory directions, certain observed drifter properties are poorly modeled. For example, modeled mean drifter velocities are smaller than observed, and upon exiting the inlet, observed drifters turn north more than modeled drifters. The model simulations do reproduce qualitatively the spreading rates observed in the inner inlet, the flow deceleration, and the increase in \n\u03bcout observed in the outer inlet. However, model spreading rates increase only to \n\u03bcout<1\u2009m2\u2009s\u22121. Smaller modeled than observed \n\u03bcout may result from using unstratified models. Noncoincident (in space) observations show evidence of a buoyant plume (\n\u0394\u03c1=1\u2009kg\u2009m\u22123) in the outer inlet, likely affecting drifter lateral spreading.

Among other factors, sea ice is sensitive to the ocean heat flux. In this study, we use in situ oceanographic, sea ice, and meteorological data collected during winter 2013/2014 in Young Sound (YS) fjord in Northeast Greenland to estimate the ocean heat flux to the landfast ice cover. During the preceding ice-free summer, incident solar radiation caused sea surface temperatures of up to 5\u20136\u00b0C. Subsequently, this heat was transferred down to the intermediate depths, but returned to the surface and retarded ice growth throughout winter. Two different approaches were used to estimate the ocean heat fluxes; (i) a residual method based on a 1-D thermodynamic ice growth model and (ii) a bulk parameterization using friction velocities and available heat content of water beneath the ice. The average heat flux in the inner YS varied from 13 W m\u22122 in October\u2013December to less than 2 W m\u22122 in January\u2013May. An average heat flux of 9 W m\u22122 was calculated for the outer YS. Moreover, we show that the upward heat flux in the outer fjord is strongly modulated by surface outflow, which produced two maxima in heat flux (up to 18\u201324 W m\u22122) during 26 December to 27 January and from 11 February to 14 March.

Both the fraction of internal tide energy that is dissipated locally and the resulting vertical mixing distribution are crucial for the ocean state, but remain poorly quantified. Here we present a first worldwide estimate of mixing due to internal tides generated at small-scale abyssal hills. Our estimate is based on linear wave theory, a nonlinear parameterization for wave breaking and uses quasi-global small-scale abyssal hill bathymetry, stratification, and tidal data. We show that a large fraction of abyssal-hill generated internal tide energy is locally dissipated over mid-ocean ridges in the Southern Hemisphere. Significant dissipation occurs above ridge crests, and, upon rescaling by the local stratification, follows a monotonic exponential decay with height off the bottom, with a nonuniform decay scale. We however show that a substantial part of the dissipation occurs over the smoother flanks of mid-ocean ridges, and exhibits a middepth maximum due to the interplay of wave amplitude with stratification. We link the three-dimensional map of dissipation to abyssal hills characteristics, ocean stratification, and tidal forcing, and discuss its potential implementation in time-evolving parameterizations for global climate models. Current tidal parameterizations only account for waves generated at large-scale satellite-resolved bathymetry. Our results suggest that the presence of small-scale, mostly unresolved abyssal hills could significantly enhance the spatial inhomogeneity of tidal mixing, particularly above mid-ocean ridges in the Southern Hemisphere.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOnce oil plumes such as those originating from underwater blowouts reach the ocean mixed layer (OML), their near-surface dispersion is influenced heavily by wind and wave-generated Langmuir turbulence. In this study, the complex oil spill dispersion process is modeled using large-eddy simulation (LES). The mean plume dispersion is characterized by performing statistical analysis of the resulting fields from the LES data. Although the instantaneous oil concentration exhibits high intermittency with complex spatial patterns such as Langmuir-induced striations, it is found that the time-averaged oil distribution can still be described quite well by smooth Gaussian-type plumes. LES results show that the competition between droplet rise velocity and vertical turbulent diffusion due to Langmuir turbulence is crucial in determining both the dilution rate and overall direction of transport of oil plumes in the OML. The smoothness of the mean plume makes it feasible to aim at modeling the oil dispersion using Reynolds-averaged type formulations, such as the K-profile parameterization (KPP) with sufficient vertical resolution to capture vertical profiles in the OML. Using LES data, we evaluate the eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity following the KPP framework. We assess the performance of previous KPP models for pure shear turbulence and Langmuir turbulence by comparing them with the LES data. Based on the assessment a modified KPP model is proposed, which shows improved overall agreement with the LES results for both the eddy viscosity and the eddy diffusivity of the oil dispersion under a variety of flow conditions and droplet sizes.\n",

The shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm is required and used to derive normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nLw(\u03bb) in the Aral Sea. We used radiance ratio nLw(555)/nLw(443) as a surrogate to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the Aral Sea. Both seasonal variability and significant interannual changes were observed when the Aral Sea desiccated between 2002 and 2013. All three separated regions of the Aral Sea show increased nLw(555)/nLw(443) ratio (a surrogate for Chl-a) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (Kd(490)) during the fall season. Of the three regions, the North Aral Sea has had the least interannual variability, while South-East (SE) Aral Sea experienced drastic changes. Waters in the SE Aral Sea are the most turbid with significantly higher Kd(490) than those in the other two subregions. Kd(490) gradually increased from \u223c2 m\u22121 in 2002 to \u223c3.5 m\u22121 after 2008 in the SE Aral Sea. In comparison, both radiance ratio nLw(555)/nLw(443) and Kd(490) were relatively stable for the North Aral Sea. In the South-West (SW) Aral Sea, however, nLw(555)/nLw(443) values reached peaks in the fall of 2007 and 2010. A possible link between the Aral Sea water property change and the regional climate variation is also discussed.\n",

But marine ecosystems are characterized by high variability, and it is not trivial to define its natural state. Here, we use the physical environment as a basis for marine classification, as it determines the conditions in which organisms must operate to survive and thrive locally. We present a delineation of the North Sea into five distinct regimes, based on multidecadal stratification characteristics. Results are based on a 51 year simulation of the region using the coupled hydrobiogeochemical model GETM-ERSEM-BFM. The five identified regimes are: permanently stratified, seasonally stratified, intermittently stratified, permanently mixed, and Region Of Freshwater Influence (ROFI). The areas characterized by these regimes show some interannual variation in geographical coverage, but are overall remarkable stable features within the North Sea. Results also show that 29% of North Sea waters fail to classify as one of the defined stratification regimes, due to high interannual variability. Biological characteristics of these regimes differ from diatom-based food webs in areas with prolonged stratification to Phaeocystis-dominated food webs in areas experiencing short-lived or no stratification. The spatial stability of the identified regimes indicates that carefully selected monitoring locations can be used to represent a substantive area of the North Sea.\n",

        "description": "\n\nInteractions of currents and waves with a rippled seabed in the inner part of the coastal ocean bottom boundary layer are studied using particle image velocimetry, ADV, and bottom roughness measurements. Mean velocity profiles collapse with appropriate scaling in the log layer, but vary substantially in the roughness sublayer. When wave-induced motions are similar or greater than the mean current, the hydrodynamic roughness (\nz0) determined from velocity profiles is substantially larger than directly measured values. The roughness signature in turbulent energy spectra persists with elevation when its scale falls in the dissipation range, but decays in the log layer for larger roughness elements. Reynolds shear stress profiles peak in the lower parts of the log layer, diminishing below it, and gradually decaying at higher elevations. In contrast, wave shear stresses are negligible within the log layer, but become significant within the roughness sublayer. This phenomenon is caused by an increase in the magnitude and phase lag of the vertical component of wave-induced motion. No single boundary layer length scale collapses the Reynolds stresses, but both the Prandtl mixing length and eddy viscosity profiles agree well with the classical model of linear increase with elevation, especially near the seabed. Within the log region, profiles of shear production and dissipation rates of turbulence converge. Below it, dissipation rapidly increases, peaking near the seabed. Conversely, the shear production decays near the seabed, in agreement with the eddy viscosity model, but in contrast to both laboratory and computational rough wall studies.\n",

Here we develop objective model skill score metrics and assess the abilities of 18 CMIP5 models to simulate the seasonal mean, amplitude, and timing of \npCO2SW in biogeographically defined ocean biomes. The models perform well at simulating the monthly timing of the seasonal minimum and maximum of \npCO2SW, but perform somewhat worse at simulating the seasonal mean values, particularly in polar and equatorial regions. The results also illustrate that a single \u201cbest\u201d model can be difficult to determine, despite an analysis restricted to the seasonality of a single variable. Nonetheless, groups of models tend to perform better than others, with significant regional differences. This suggests that particular models may be better suited for particular regions, though we find no evidence for model tuning. Timing and amplitude skill scores display a weak positive correlation with observational data density, while the seasonal mean scores display a weak negative correlation. Thus, additional mapped \npCO2SW data may not directly increase model skill scores; however, improved knowledge of the dominant mechanisms may improve model skill. Lastly, we find skill score variability due to internal model variability to be much lower than variability within the CMIP5 intermodel spread, suggesting that mechanistic model differences are primarily responsible for differences in model skill scores.\n",

Low silicic acid: nitrate ratios (Si:N) and high nitrate to iron ratios (N:Fe) characteristic of Fe-limiting conditions in the sCCS were associated with the northern cyclone and with the transition zone between the cyclones and the anticyclone. Phytoplankton growth in low-Si:N, high-N:Fe waters responded strongly to added Fe, confirming growth limitation by Fe of the diatom-dominated phytoplankton community. Low Si:N waters had low biogenic silica content, intermediate productivity, but high export compared to intermediate Si:N waters indicating increased export efficiency under Fe stress. Biogenic silica and particulate organic carbon (POC) export were both high beneath low Si:N waters with biogenic silica export being especially enhanced. This suggests that relatively high POC export from low Si:N waters was supported by silica ballasting from Fe-limited diatoms. Higher POC export efficiency in low Si:N waters may have been further enhanced by lower rates of organic carbon remineralization due to reduced grazing of more heavily armored diatoms growing under Fe stress. The results imply that Fe stress can enhance carbon export, despite lowering productivity, by driving higher export efficiency.\n",

In general, the percentages of TEP-carbon to POC were high (the mean values for the shelf and slope-basin regions were 135.4\u2009\u00b1\u200958.0% (\u00b1 standard deviation, n\u2009=\u200936) and 187.6\u2009\u00b1\u200973.3% (n\u2009=\u200958), respectively), relative to the corresponding values reported for other oceanic regions, suggesting that TEP play an important role in regulating particle dynamics. A hotspot (extremely high concentration) of particles, accompanied by high prokaryote abundance and production, was observed near the seafloor (depth 50 m) of the shelf region. Localized accumulation of particles was also found in the thin layer near the pycnocline (depth 10\u201330 m) and on the slope. Over a broader spatial scale, particle concentration gradients were identified from the shelf to the basin in the upper water column (<50 m). The particle-size distribution analysis indicated that relatively small particles were dominant in the shelf region compared to the slope-basin region. These results suggest that particles containing large amounts of TEP are produced in the shelf region and are potentially delivered to the slope-basin region along the pycnocline, which might support productivity and material cycles in the nutrient-depleted basin region of the western Arctic Ocean.\n",

This has motivated a number of authors to search for already existing accelerations in observations, which would be, if present, vital for coastal protection planning purposes. No scientific consensus has been reached yet as to how a possible acceleration could be separated from intrinsic climate variability in sea level records. This has led to an intensive debate on its existence and, if absent, also on the general validity of current future projections. Here we shed light on the controversial discussion from a methodological point of view. To do so, we provide a comprehensive review of trend methods used in the community so far. This resulted in an overview of 30 methods, each having its individual mathematical formulation, flexibilities, and characteristics. We illustrate that varying trend approaches may lead to contradictory acceleration-deceleration inferences. As for statistics-oriented trend methods, we argue that checks on model assumptions and model selection techniques yield a way out. However, since these selection methods all have implicit assumptions, we show that good modeling practices are of importance too. We conclude at this point that (i) several differently characterized methods should be applied and discussed simultaneously, (ii) uncertainties should be taken into account to prevent biased or wrong conclusions, and (iii) removing internally generated climate variability by incorporating atmospheric or oceanographic information helps to uncover externally forced climate change signals.\n",

Whether this increased primary production (PP) will translate into increased export of particulate organic carbon (POC) is currently unclear. Here we report on the POC export efficiency during summer 2012 in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean. We coupled 234-thorium based estimates of the export flux of POC to onboard incubation-based estimates of PP. Export efficiency (defined as the fraction of PP that is exported below 100 m depth: ThE-ratio) showed large variability (0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\u20131.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3). The highest ThE-ratio (1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3) was recorded in a mono-specific bloom of Phaeocystis pouchetii located in the ice edge. Blooming diatom dominated areas also had high ThE-ratios (0.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u20130.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2), while mixed and/or prebloom communities showed lower ThE-ratios (0.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u20130.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05). Furthermore, using oxygen saturation, bacterial abundance, bacterial production, and zooplankton oxygen demand, we also investigated spatial variability in the degree to which this sinking material may be remineralized in the upper mesopelagic (<300 m). Our results suggest that blooming diatoms and P. pouchetii can export a significant fraction of their biomass below the surface layer (100 m) in the open Arctic Ocean. Also, we show evidence that the material sinking from a P. pouchetii bloom may be remineralized (>100 m) at a similar rate as the material sinking from diatom blooms in the upper mesopelagic, contrary to previous findings.\n",

In particular, the water column of KC is characterized by substantially lower nutrients and productivity but higher Trichodesmium abundance and nitrogen fixation compared to the NSCS. The mechanism driving the difference of the two marine ecosystems, however, remains inadequately understood. Here, a one-dimensional biogeochemical model was developed to simulate the long-term variability of lower-trophic planktonic ecosystem for two pelagic stations in the NSCS and the KC near the Luzon Strait. The physical model included the vertical mixing driven by air-sea interaction and the Ekman pumping induced by wind stress curl. The biological model was constructed by modifying a nitrogen-based NPZD model with the incorporation of phosphorus cycle and diazotroph nitrogen fixation. After validation by several field data sets, the model was used to study the impact of long-term physical forcing on ecosystem variability in the two distinct stations. Our results suggested that nutrient transport above nitracline during summer was largely controlled by vertical turbulent mixing, while Ekman pumping was important for nutrient transport below the nitracline. Our results also indicated that diazotroph community structure and N2 fixation in the NSCS and the KC could be strongly influenced by physical processes through the impacts on vertical nutrient fluxes. The disadvantage of diazotroph in the NSCS in compared to the KC during the summer could be attributed to its high nitrate fluxes from subsurface leading to outcompete of diazotrophs by faster growing nondiazotroph phytoplankton.\n",

The remotely derived roller length and an in situ estimate of wave slope are used to estimate dissipation due to wave breaking by means of the wave-resolving model by Duncan (1981). The wave energy dissipation rate estimates show a pattern of increased breaking during low tide over a sand bar, consistent with in situ turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate estimates from fixed and drifting instruments over the bar. When integrated over the surf zone width, these dissipation rate estimates account for 40\u201369% of the incoming wave energy flux.

Here using historical observations of surface ocean nitrate, wind, and currents, we have investigated how horizontal and vertical supplies of nitrate control seasonal changes in the size and shape of oligotrophic regions of the subtropical North Atlantic. In general, the oligotrophic region of the subtropical North Atlantic is associated with the region of weak vertical supply of nitrate. Though the total vertical supply of nitrate here is generally greater than the total horizontal supply, we find that seasonal expansion and contraction of the oligotrophic region is consistent with changes in horizontal supply of nitrate. In this dynamic periphery of the subtropical gyre, the seasonal variations in chlorophyll are linked to variations in horizontal nitrate supply that facilitate changes in intracellular pigment concentrations, and to a lesser extent, phytoplankton biomass. Our results suggest that horizontal transports of nutrient are crucial in setting seasonal cycles of chlorophyll in large expanses of the subtropical North Atlantic, and may play a key and underappreciated role in regulating interannual variations in these globally important marine ecosystems.\n",

Such sea level variability should be taken into consideration when planning efforts to mitigate the effects of future sea level change. In this study, we quantify the contribution to regional sea level of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Through cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis (CSEOF) of the long reconstructed sea level data set and of a set of U.S. tide gauges, two global modes dominated by Pacific Ocean variability are identified and related to ENSO and, by extension, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. By estimating the combined contribution of these two modes to regional sea level, we find that ENSO can contribute significantly on short time scales, with contributions of up to 20 cm along the west coast of the U.S. The CSEOF decomposition of the long tide gauge records around the U.S. highlights the influence of ENSO on the U.S. east coast. Tandem analyses of both the reconstructed and tide gauge records also examine the utility of the sea level reconstructions for near-coast studies.\n",

Analysis of in situ data over a grid of hydrographic stations and oblique zooplankton hauls with bongo net (505 \u00b5m) was combined with orthogonal robust functions decomposition applied to altimetry anomalies obtained from satellite. During both cool (March and June) and warm (August and November) periods, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity Index defined three recurrent larval fish habitats which varied in species composition and extent as a function of the environmental scales. The variability of the Tropical larval fish habitat (characterized by high species richness, and dominated by Vinciguerria lucetia, Diogenichthys laternatus, and Diaphus pacificus) was associated with the seasonal changes. The Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat (dominated by V. lucetia and D. laternatus, with lower mean abundance and lower species richness than in the Tropical habitat) and Coastal-and-Upwelling larval fish habitat (dominated by Bregmaceros bathymaster) was associated mainly with mesoscale activity induced by eddies and with coastal upwelling. During February 2010, the Tropical larval fish habitat predominated offshore and the Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat was not present, which we attribute to the effect of El Ni\u00f1o conditions.

        "description": "\n\nIn the western North Atlantic, warm and saline water is brought by the North Atlantic Current (NAC) from the subtropics into the subpolar gyre. Four inverted echo sounders with high precision pressure sensors (PIES) were moored between 47\u00b040\u2032N and 52\u00b030\u2032N to study the main pathways of the NAC from the western into the eastern basin. The array configuration that forms three segments (northern, central, and southern) allows partitioning of the NAC and some assessment of NAC flow paths through the different Mid-Atlantic Ridge fracture zones. We exploit the correlation between the NAC transport measured between 2006 and 2010 and the geostrophic velocity from altimeter data to extend the time series of NAC transports to the period from 1992 to 2013. The mean NAC transport over the entire 21 years is 27\u2009\u00b1\u20095 Sv, consisting of 60% warm water of subtropical origin and 40% subpolar water. We did not find a significant trend in the total transport time series, but individual segments had opposing trends, leading to a more focused NAC in the central subsection and decreasing transports in the southern and northern segments. The spectral analysis exhibits several significant peaks. The two most prominent are around 120 days, identified as the time scale of meanders and eddies, and at 4\u20139 years, most likely related to the NAO. Transport composites for the years of highest and lowest NAO indices showed a significantly higher transport (+2.9 Sv) during strong NAO years, mainly in the southern segment.\n",

A quasi-3-D nearshore community model, NearCoM-TVD, is used in this integrated observational and modeling study. The model is validated with observations of waves and currents at 30 locations, including in a recently dredged navigation channel and a shallower channel, and on the ebb tidal delta, for a range of flow and offshore wave conditions during May 2012. In the channels, model skills for flow velocity and wave height are high. Near the ebb tidal delta, the model reproduces the observed rapid onshore (offshore) decay of wave heights (current velocities). Model results reveal that this sharp transition coincides with the location of the breaker zone over the ebb tidal delta, which is modulated by semidiurnal tides and by wave intensity. The modulation of wave heights is primarily owing to depth changes rather than direct wave-current interaction. The modeled tidally averaged residual flow patterns show that waves play an important role in generating vortices and landward-directed currents near the inlet entrance. Numerical experiments suggest that these flow patterns are associated with the channel-shoal bathymetry near the inlet, similar to the generation of rip currents. Consistent with other inlet studies, model results suggest that tidal currents drive sediment fluxes in the channels, but that sediment fluxes on the ebb tidal delta are driven primarily by waves.\n",

Results showed that near-surface mixing was related to lateral circulation during the ebb phase of a tidal cycle, and that the linkage was somewhat similar from neap to spring tides. During neap tides, near-surface mixing was generated by the straining of lateral density gradients influenced by the advection of fresh, riverine water on the right side (looking seaward) of the transect. Spring tide results revealed similar findings on the right side of the cross section. However, on the left side, the straining by velocity shears acted in concert with density straining. Weak along-estuary velocities over the left shoal were connected to faster velocities in the channel via a clockwise lateral circulation (looking seaward). These results provided evidence that in the absence of direct wind forcing, near-surface vertical mixing can occur from mechanisms uncoupled from bottom friction.\n",

The nonhydrostatic wave-flow model SWASH was used to simulate the local wavefield for a range of wave conditions (including mild and storm conditions). The extensive spatial coverage of the model allowed us to analyze the infragravity-wave dynamics at spatial scales not often covered before. Overall, the model predicted a wavefield that was representative of the natural conditions, supporting the model application to analyze the wave dynamics. The infragravity-wave field was typically dominated by leaky waves, except near the outer bar where bar-trapped edge waves were observed. Relative contributions of bar-trapped waves peaked during mild conditions, when they explained up to 50% of the infragravity variance. Near the outer bar, the infragravity-wave growth was partly explained by nonlinear energy transfers from short waves. This growth was strongest for mild conditions, and decreased for more energetic conditions when short waves were breaking at the outer bar. Further shoreward, infragravity waves lost most of their energy, due to a combination of nonlinear transfers, bottom friction, and infragravity-wave breaking. Nonlinear transfers were only effective near the inner bar, whereas near the shoreline (where losses were strongest) the dissipation was caused by the combined effect of bottom friction and breaking. This study demonstrated the model's potential to study wave dynamics at field scales not easily covered by in situ observations.\n",

Its low temperature is maintained by intrusions of cold water formed over Arctic shelves in winter. Surprisingly, cold salty (33) water capable of halocline ventilation (Beaufort Sea Winter Water: BSWW) has been observed in the Beaufort Sea during some winters despite the low salinity (20\u201325) of shelf waters there in summer. This study uses year-round data from moored instruments on the Beaufort shelf and slope during 2009\u20132011 to investigate the mechanisms involved. Our analysis reveals that four air-sea interaction processes contribute to the formation of BSWW\u2014flushing of the low-salinity surface water from the shelf via Ekman transport in late summer and early fall, compensatory upwelling of more saline halocline water onto the shelf, net seaward ice drift that promotes ice production by maintaining a flaw lead, and entrainment of dense upwelled water into the freezing surface layer on the inner shelf. This work moves beyond earlier studies in revealing that while weather conditions were more favorable to BSWW formation in the winter of 2010\u20132011 than in 2009\u20132010, the difference was more strongly influenced by Ekman transport (offshore at the surface, onshore at the seabed) than by differences in cumulative brine injection from ice growth. The strength of the Ekman circulation over the Canadian Beaufort shelf in winter and its interannual variation have significance for surface nutrient renewal and for the cross-shelf transport of pollutants at the surface and the seabed.\n",

These compounds are believed to play an important role in the marine atmospheric chemistry after their emission. The measurements were performed with high time-resolution (1\u20136 h intervals) using an online equilibrator gas chromatography mass spectrometer. C5H8 was most abundant in high-productivity transitional waters and eutrophic tropical waters. The chlorophyll-a normalized production rates of C5H8 were high in the warm subtropical and tropical waters, suggesting the existence of a high emitter of C5H8 in the biological community of the warm waters. High concentrations of the three VOIs in highly productive transitional water were attributed to biological productions. For CH3I, the highest concentrations were widely distributed in the basin area of the oligotrophic subtropical NW Pacific, probably due to photochemical production and/or high emission rates from phytoplankton. In contrast, the lowest concentrations of C2H5I in subtropical waters were attributed to photochemical removal. Enhancement of CH2ClI concentrations in the shelf-slope areas of the Chukchi Sea and the transitional waters of the NW Pacific in winter suggested that vertical mixing with subsurface waters by regional upwelling or winter cooling acts to increase the CH2ClI concentrations in surface layer. Sea-air flux calculations revealed that the fluxes of CH2ClI were the highest among the three VOIs in shelf-slope areas; the CH3I flux was highest in basin areas.\n",

Idealized models supported the potential of this process to influence the distribution of buoyant colonies over time scales of several months. In spring 2011, the highest vertically integrated colony abundances were observed in anticyclones. These peaks in abundance correlated with anomalously fresh water, suggesting riverine input as a driver of the relationship.

While lower-frequency (near-inertial) internal waves are known to be important sources of turbulence, we report here a higher-frequency internal wave breaking near the ocean surface. Due to observational limitations, the exact nature of the instability cannot be conclusively identified, but the interaction of wave-induced velocity with unresolved background shear appears to be the most likely candidate. These observations add a new process to the list of those currently being considered as potentially important for near-surface mixing. The geographical distribution and global significance of such features are unknown, and underscore the need for more extensive small-scale, rapid observations of the ocean surface layer.\n",

The method is applied to output from an ocean general circulation model in the Indian Ocean to investigate variability and changes in MLD. On seasonal timescales and for most areas of the Indian Ocean variability of MLD is tightly linked to all thermohaline budget terms. In the Indian Ocean at approximately 20\u00b0S the MLD covaries with surface heat and freshwater fluxes on intraseasonal and interannual timescales. The geography of the region includes the Leeuwin Current, plus the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for interannual surface freshwater fluxes. The range of seasonal amplitudes of MLD variability varies with individual budget terms but is typically within 1 m/month to 100 m/month. The ocean footprints of an intraseasonal tropical cyclone, tropical and midlatitude seasonal temperature and salinity budgets and interannual variability associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode are analyzed. The results reveal close relationships of the thermohaline budgets within the mixed layer with the variability of the MLD. The associated tendencies of changes in MLD are consistent with Argo and satellite-based observations of tendencies within the mixed layer and sea-surface temperature and salinity.\n",

But previous studies in low latitudes have shown that models that include phytoplankton community structure can have improved predictive capability. In this study, we measured photosynthetic parameters from photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) experiments, phytoplankton absorption coefficients, and phytoplankton community structure derived from algal pigments during four cruises in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). The maximum quantum yield of CO2 (\n\u03a6mC) and the chlorophyll a-normalized P-E curve light-limited slope (\u03b1B) varied significantly with the blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption peaks (aph(435)/aph(676)) (p\u2009<\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.459 and \u22120.332, respectively). The unexplained variability could be due in part to the absorption associated with nonphotosynthetic pigments. The chlorophyll a-normalized light-saturated photosynthetic rate (\nPmB) at the surface showed a unimodal distribution over the chlorophyll a range during the spring and summer, and significantly increased when Prochlorococcus was outcompeted by other picophytoplankton (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Almost 60% of the variance of \nPmB could be explained by a piecewise regression with phytoplankton absorption coefficients and pigment markers. Unlike previous studies, our data showed that changes of \nPmB were unrelated to the size structure of phytoplankton. Although a temperature-based approach could not effectively predict \u03b1B and \nPmB in the NSCS, a trophic-based approach can be used for assignment of these parameters in a regional primary production model using ocean-color data.\n",

Under the ITCZ, sea-surface salinity (SSS) fronts that extend zonally across the basins are observed by the Aquarius/SAC-D mission and Argo floats. This study examined the evolution and forcing mechanisms of the SSS fronts. It is found that, although the SSS fronts are sourced from the ITCZ-freshened surface waters, the formation, structure, and propagation of these fronts are governed by the trade wind driven Ekman processes. Three features characterize the governing role of Ekman forcing. First, the SSS fronts are associated with near-surface salinity-minimum zones (SMZs) of 50\u201380 m deep. The SMZs are formed during December\u2013March when the near-equatorial Ekman convergence zone concurs with an equatorward displaced ITCZ. Second, after the formation, the SMZs are carried poleward away at a speed of \u223c3.5 km d\u22121 by Ekman transport. The monotonic poleward propagation is a sharp contrast to the seasonal north/south oscillation of the ITCZ. Lastly, each SMZ lasts about 12\u201315 months until dissipated at latitudes beyond 10\u00b0N/S. The persistence of more than 1 calendar year allows two SMZs to coexist during the formation season (December\u2013March), with the newly formed SMZ located near the equator while the SMZ that is formed in the previous year located near the latitudes of 10\u201315\u00b0 poleward after 1 year's propagation. The contrast between the ITCZ and SMZ highlights the dominance of Ekman dynamics on the relationship between the SSS and the ocean water cycle.\n",

Decadal analyses reveal that the EAC extension water at Maria Island increased gradually from the 1940s to 1980s, followed by a rapid increase since the 1990s. This acceleration coincided with enhanced winter nitrate, implying increased injections of subantarctic water at Maria Island. Satellite-derived chl a at six coastal sites and offshore companion sites in the western Tasman Sea showed significant inshore-offshore variations in seasonal cycle and long-term trend. After 2004\u20132005, the Maria Island seasonal cycle became increasingly similar to those of Bass Strait and St. Helens, suggesting that the EAC extension water was extending further southward. Comparative analyses of inshore-offshore sites showed that the presence of EAC extension water declined offshore. Seasonal cycles at Maria Island show a recent shift away from the traditional spring bloom, toward increased winter biomass, and enhanced primary productivity consistent with extensions of warm, energetic EAC extension water and more frequent injections of cooler, fresher nitrate-replete waters. Overall, we find complex temporal, latitudinal, and inshore-offshore changes in multiple water masses, particularly at Maria Island, and changes in primary productivity that will profoundly impact fisheries and ecosystems.\n",

Here, we use GRACE OBP observations to calculate transport variability in a region of the southern Indian Ocean encompassing the major fronts of the ACC. We use a statistical analysis of a simulated GRACE-like data set to determine the uncertainty of the estimated transport for the 2003.0\u20132013.0 time period. We find that when the transport is averaged over 60\u00b0 of longitude, the uncertainty (one standard error) is close to 1 Sv (1 Sv\u2009=\u2009106 m3 s\u22121) for low-pass filtered transport, which is significantly smaller than the signal and lower than previous studies have found. The interannual variability is correlated with the Southern Annual mode (SAM) (0.61), but more highly correlated with circumpolar zonally averaged winds between 45\u00b0S and 65\u00b0S (0.88). GRACE transport reflects significant changes in transport between 2007 and 2009 that is observed in the zonal wind variations but not in the SAM index. We also find a statistically significant trend in transport (\u22121.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 Sv yr\u22121, 90% confidence) that is correlated with a local deceleration in zonal winds related to an asymmetry in the SAM on multidecadal periods.\n",

The quality, errors, and repeatability of the snow radar snow depth estimates are examined, based on comparisons with in situ data obtained during two separate sea ice field campaigns, the GreenArc 2009 and the CryoVEx 2011 campaigns off Greenland in the Lincoln Sea. Finally, we analyze 4 years (2009\u20132012) of three annually repeated sea ice flight lines obtained in early spring, located off Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. We examine the annual variations of snow depth differences between perennial and seasonal ice when available.

The horizontal distributions of depth-averaged temperature from 0 to 8 m were mapped at 10 min intervals between the 11 and 25 September 2013. The horizontal distributions of a coastal upwelling and the associated diurnal internal tides were reconstructed well by regularized inversion based on the grid segmented method, using one-way travel time data along five successful sound transmission lines. Station-to-station ranges were corrected in such a way that sound speed (determined from one-way travel time data) was equal to sound speed calculated from a couple of CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) data sets on each transmission line. In addition, all station positions were adjusted to make focal points at the geographical positions of the transducers. The corrections increased the accuracy of temperature measurements to make temperature errors as small as 0.073\u20130.079\u00b0C. The high accuracy made it possible to map the temperature structure with a variation range of less than 0.5\u00b0C. An upwelling grew from 16 to 17 September, due to a typhoon-derived northerly wind. The diurnal internal tide resonated with the semidiurnal external tide, which was pronounced after the upwelling decayed (18 September), around the time the spring tide occurred. The upwelling and mixing fractions were formulated. These fractions increased continuously as the upwelling grew. Complete mixing was observed during the upwelling's mature phase.\n",

Results show a good agreement between in situ and model results in terms of spatial and temporal mean SSS patterns, geographically varying SSS variability, and spatial and temporal scales of SSS variability. A good agreement exists also for estimates of the amplitude and phase of the annual cycle of SSS with the model providing more spatial details of SSS variability, which cannot be resolved by observations, especially near ocean margins and in shelf areas. Dominant spatial and temporal scales of SSS variability are, respectively, between 100 and 250 km and between 30 and 70 days in most of the Atlantic when the annual cycle of the SSS is included. However, smaller-scale salinity features are also present, which show temporal decorrelation scales of only 3\u20135 days throughout the Atlantic. This fast variability must be considered when producing weekly averaged salinity products from satellite measurements.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn the coastal ocean off the Northeast U.S., the sea surface temperature (SST) in the first half of 2012 was the highest on the record for the past roughly 150 years of recorded observations. The underlying dynamical processes responsible for this extreme event are examined using a numerical model, and the relative contributions of air-sea heat flux versus lateral ocean advective heat flux are quantified. The model accurately reproduces the observed vertical structure and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the thermohaline condition of the Gulf of Maine and the Middle Atlantic Bight waters during the anomalous warming period. Analysis of the model results show that the warming event was primarily driven by the anomalous air-sea heat flux, while the smaller contribution by the ocean advection worked against this flux by acting to cool the shelf. The anomalous air-sea heat flux exhibited a shelf-wide coherence, consistent with the shelf-wide warming pattern, while the ocean advective heat flux was dominated by localized, relatively smaller-scale processes. The anomalous cooling due to advection primarily resulted from the along-shelf heat flux divergence in the Gulf of Maine, while in the Middle Atlantic Bight the advective contribution from the along-shelf and cross-shelf heat flux divergences was comparable. The modeling results confirm the conclusion of the recent analysis of in situ data by Chen et al. (2014a) that the changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the winter of 2011\u20132012 primarily caused the extreme warm anomaly in the spring of 2012. The effect of along-shelf or cross-shelf ocean advection on the warm anomalies from either the Scotian Shelf or adjacent continental slope was secondary.\n",

This technique relies on an iterative generalized least squares procedure to determine the statistics of the small-scale fluctuations directly from the data and is thus especially valuable when such information is not known a priori. The use of spherical radial basis functions in fitting the large-scale signal is suggested, particularly when the domain is sufficiently large. Two test cases illustrate several of the properties of this procedure, demonstrate its utility, and provide practical guidelines for its use. This method is then applied to observations collected by the Argo array of profiling floats to produce global gridded absolute geostrophic velocity estimates.\n",

Detailed analyses have indicated that this strength asymmetry is mainly derived from the weaker sensitivity of the zonal sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly to that of the diabatic heating anomaly during the development phase of CP El Ni\u00f1o events, which mainly results from the large cancelation induced by the negative sea surface temperature (SST)-cloud thermodynamic feedback that negates the positive dynamical feedback. This study validates these conclusions by using historical runs of 20 models involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Our results suggest that the CMIP5 models generally depict the asymmetry in amplitude between the two types of El Ni\u00f1o events well, which is consistent with successfully simulating the strength asymmetry of the Bjerknes feedback. As observed during both types of El Ni\u00f1o events, variations in the total cloud amount and shortwave radiation also indicated that the cloud-radiative effect is an important factor that causes amplitude asymmetry between CP and EP El Ni\u00f1o events. However, the CMIP5 models are severely biased when capturing realistic CP El Ni\u00f1o structures, namely few models can simulate the significantly weaker warming anomalies in the EP relative to the CP.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe effect of three-dimensional wave-induced streaming on the seabed boundary layer is investigated for following and opposing waves and current where the wave propagation forms a nonzero angle with the current. It is shown that the seabed boundary layer flow results from an interaction between the classical wave-current interaction (reducing the mean velocity relative to current alone), Longuet-Higgins streaming (forcing the flow in the wave propagation direction), and streaming caused by turbulence asymmetry in successive wave half-cycles (forcing the flow against the wave propagation direction). For waves and current which are not colinear, the mean velocity profile exhibits a veering behavior which is strongly affected by streaming, particularly for the most wave-dominated situations. The effect of streaming on the boundary layer flow has been investigated for different wave-current conditions and bottom roughnesses. Visualizations are given by mean Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity profiles, as well as three-dimensional seabed boundary layer particle trajectories. The effect of streaming decreases as the flow becomes more current dominated. The mean velocity in the current direction decreases as the roughness increases. However, the mean velocity orthogonal to the current direction increases as the roughness increases due to the lack of wave-current interaction in this direction. An excellent agreement between the predicted and recently measured velocity profiles beneath horizontally uniform asymmetric forcing is obtained.\n",

Results are produced using an ocean model (NEMO) coupled to two different sea ice models: the Louvain-La-Neuve single-category model (LIM2) and the Los Alamos multicategory model (CICE4). A more objective way to adjust the sea ice-ocean drag is proposed compared to a coefficient tuning approach. The air-ice drag is also adjusted to be more consistent with the atmospheric forcing data set. Improving the AIO SL treatment leads to more realistic results, having a significant impact on the sea ice volume trend, sea ice thickness, and the Arctic freshwater (FW) budget. The physical mechanisms explaining this sensitivity are studied. Improved sea ice drift speeds result in less sea ice accumulation in the Beaufort Sea, correcting a typical ice thickness bias. Sea ice thickness and drag parameters affect how atmospheric stress is transferred to the ocean, thereby influencing Ekman transport and FW retention in the Beaufort Gyre (BG). Increasing sea ice-ocean roughness reduces sea ice growth in winter by reducing ice deformation and lead fractions in the BG. It also increases the total Arctic FW content by reducing sea ice export through Fram Strait. Similarly, increasing air-ice roughness increases the total Arctic FW content by increasing FW retention in the BG.\n",

        "description": "\n\nTo investigate the relationships between the movement of an eddy and its interior structure and water properties, four profiling floats were deployed in an anticyclonic eddy in the western North Pacific in 2013 (April\u2013October). Daily float profiles showed rapid changes in temperature and salinity corresponding to strong interactions between eddies north of the subtropical Kuroshio Extension. After the first interaction with a warm-core eddy in April, the isolation of the winter mixed layer from the surface was observed, forming a subsurface remnant layer. Another interaction with a cold fresh eddy at middepths in May resulted in the formation of a multilayer structure. The eddy then moved poleward along the Japan and Kuril-Kamchatka trenches, indicating changes in its propagation pattern coupled to its interior structure. The eddy then moved northward (June\u2013July), stalled (July\u2013August), and moved eastward (August\u2013October). In addition to a general declining trend, the properties of the warm saline core changed over a short time period, coinciding with changes in propagation. A density anomaly at middepths of the eddy changed location during the stalled period; however, denser waters were continuously observed in the southeast part of the eddy during its northward and eastward movement. This unidirectional density anomaly pattern was consistent with the structure of the poleward-propagating eddy, which interacted with the western topographic boundary. Meridional exchanges of heat and material were potentially elevated by the eddy's advection and movement, as well as by water modifications in the eddy associated with exchanges along its perimeter.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe physical processes controlling the mixed layer salinity (MLS) seasonal budget in the tropical Atlantic Ocean are investigated using a regional configuration of an ocean general circulation model. The analysis reveals that the MLS cycle is generally weak in comparison of individual physical processes entering in the budget because of strong compensation. In evaporative regions, around the surface salinity maxima, the ocean acts to freshen the mixed layer against the action of evaporation. Poleward of the southern SSS maxima, the freshening is ensured by geostrophic advection, the vertical salinity diffusion and, during winter, a dominant contribution of the convective entrainment. On the equatorward flanks of the SSS maxima, Ekman transport mainly contributes to supply freshwater from ITCZ regions while vertical salinity diffusion adds on the effect of evaporation. All these terms are phase locked through the effect of the wind. Under the seasonal march of the ITCZ and in coastal areas affected by river (7\u00b0S:15\u00b0N), the upper ocean freshening by precipitations and/or runoff is attenuated by vertical salinity diffusion. In the eastern equatorial regions, seasonal cycle of wind forced surface currents advect freshwaters, which are mixed with subsurface saline water because of the strong vertical turbulent diffusion. In all these regions, the vertical diffusion presents an important contribution to the MLS budget by providing, in general, an upwelling flux of salinity. It is generally due to vertical salinity gradient and mixing due to winds. Furthermore, in the equator where the vertical shear, associated to surface horizontal currents, is developed, the diffusion depends also on the sheared flow stability.\n",

Extreme storm waves attacked the Pacific coast of Eastern Samar where the violent typhoon first made landfall. Our field survey confirmed that storm overwash heights of 6\u201314 m above mean sea level were distributed along the southeastern coast and extensive inundation occurred in some coastal villages in spite of natural protection by wide fringing reefs. A wave model based on Boussinesq-type equations is constructed to simulate wave transformation over shallow fringing reefs and validated against existing laboratory data. Wave propagation and runup on the Eastern Samar coast are then reproduced using offshore boundary conditions based on a wave hindcast. The model results suggest that extreme waves on the shore are characterized as a superposition of the infragravity wave and sea-swell components. The balance of the two components is strongly affected by the reef width and beach slope through wave breaking, frictional dissipation, reef-flat resonances, and resonant runup amplification. Therefore, flood characteristics significantly differ from site to site due to a large variation of the two topographic parameters on the hilly coast. Strong coupling of infragravity waves and sea swells produces extreme runup on steep beaches fronted by narrow reefs, whereas the infragravity waves become dominant over wide reefs and they evolve into bores on steep beaches.\n",

This leads to large uncertainties to the flushing time derived from them and to the evaluation of ecosystem resilience to terrestrially derived pollution. In fact, numerical hydrodynamic models and analytical cross-shore diffusion models have predicted very different flushing times for the GBR lagoon. Nevertheless, scarcity of in situ measurements used previously in the latter method prevents derivation of detailed diffusivity profiles. Here detailed cross-shore profiles of diffusivity were calculated explicitly in a closed form for the first time from the steady state transects of sea surface temperature for different sections of the GBR lagoon. We find that diffusivity remains relatively constant within the inner lagoon (<\u223c20 km) where tidal current is weak, and increases linearly with sufficiently large tidal amplitude in reef-devoid regions, but increases dramatically where the reef matrixes start and fluctuates with reef size and density. The cross-shelf profile of steady state salinity calculated using the derived diffusivity values agrees well with field measurements. The calculated diffusivity values are also consistent with values derived from satellite-tracked drifters. Flushing time by offshore diffusion is of the order of 1 month, suggesting the important role of turbulent diffusion in flushing the lagoon, especially in reef-distributed regions. The results imply that previous very large residence times predicted by numerical hydrodynamic models may result from underestimation of diffusivity. Our findings can guide parameterization of diffusivity in hydrodynamic modeling.\n",

These events can input nutrients onto the continental shelf as well as advect larvae offshore. We find that the meander drives inshore upwelling with vertical velocities of at least 13 m d\u22121. The meander also causes diapycnal transport resulting in 1\u00b0C cooler and 0.25 fresher central waters and 1\u00b0C warmer, 0.25 saltier intermediate waters below the thermocline. We introduce a new coordinate system that separates these changes into kinematic changes due to meandering and property changes along transport streamlines. This reveals that most of the observed diapycnal transport below the thermocline is due to property changes. We find a small amount of enhanced cross-frontal mixing associated with solitary meanders of the Agulhas Current, but it is statistically insignificant. We believe this is due to the strongly barotropic nature of the meandering Agulhas Current, which maintains a deep steering level that inhibits mixing.\n",

The anatomy of a major filament is investigated on scales down to the submesoscale using in situ and remotely sensed data. The filament may be viewed as a system composed of three intimately connected structures: a small, shallow, and cold filament embedded within a larger, deeper, and cool filament and an intrathermocline anticyclonic eddy (ITE). The cold filament, which stretches 110 km offshore, is a shallow feature 60 m deep and 25 km wide, identified by minimal surface temperatures and rich in chlorophyll a. This structure comprises two asymmetrical submesoscale (\u223c18 km) fronts with jets flowing in opposite directions. The cold filament is embedded near the equatorward boundary of a much broader region of approximately 120 km width and 150 m depth that forms the cool filament and stretches at least 200 km offshore. This cool region, partly resulting from the influence of cold filament, is limited by two asymmetrical mesoscale (\u223c50 km) frontal boundaries. At the ITE, located north of the cold filament, we observe evidence of downwelling as indicated by a relatively high concentration of particles extending from the surface to more than 200 m depth. We hypothesize that this ITE may act as a sink of carbon and thus the filament system may serve dual roles of offshore carbon export and carbon sink.\n",

The DHA fields are compared with the SLA fields derived from the same OI applied to the along-track SLA data. The results show that the equatorial Kelvin waves and tropical instability waves are well captured by Argo floats. Eddies are also monitored effectively in the subtropical western North Pacific.

A simple test of the space-time OI analysis shows that more than six data in the e-folding domain, where the correlation coefficient of ocean variation is above e\u22121, are required for the reliable analysis with 99% confidence level. Argo floats provide sufficient number of observations for the reliable analysis in the low latitudes and some areas in the North Pacific.

Stochastic tsunami scenarios are generated based on the spectral analysis and synthesis method with regards to an inverted source model. To assess spatial inundation processes accurately, tsunami modeling is conducted using bathymetry and elevation data with 50 m grid resolutions. Using the developed methodology for assessing variability of tsunami hazard estimates, stochastic inundation depth maps can be generated for local coastal communities. These maps are important for improving disaster preparedness by understanding the consequences of different situations/conditions, and by communicating uncertainty associated with hazard predictions. The analysis indicates that the sensitivity of inundation areas to the geometrical parameters (i.e., top-edge depth, strike, and dip) depends on the tsunami source characteristics and the site location, and is therefore complex and highly nonlinear. The variability assessment of inundation footprints indicates significant influence of slip distributions.

At tidal time scales, the system is dominated by a barotropic semidiurnal standing wave with a west to east decrease in tidal amplitude and relatively minimal phase change across the majority of the transect. The stratification (vertical differences of 0.5\u20131.0 kg m\u22123) was generally laterally uniform and stronger during the flood phase which is hypothesized to result from stronger offshore stratification. The mean circulation had strong lateral shear with inflow over the deepest point in the bathymetric cross section and eastern slope and outflow over the western slope. There was also vertical shearing of the horizontal velocities with stronger northward (or northward trending) velocities at depth. The depth-averaged subtidal fluctuations were relatively small (\u223c2\u20133 cm s\u22121) and uncorrelated between mooring sites suggesting the vertically uniform current response associated with remote wind forcing is of limited importance. On the other hand, the depth-dependent velocity fluctuations at the subtidal time scale were, in large part (\u223c36\u201372%), driven by wind forcing. The net flux ratio, a means of quantifying the relative importance of the vertical and lateral shear in the flow field, was typically \u223c0.44 indicating the structure of the local wind response favored vertically sheared flow.\n",
