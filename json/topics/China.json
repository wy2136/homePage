However, most of the cited works (admittedly, including our previous work), employ correlation analysis, which has little bearing on the cause\u2013effect relationship. Theoretical analyses and/or modeling studies are needed to ascertain the cause\u2013effect relationship.

In this study, the trend and temporal variation of extreme precipitation are analyzed using daily precipitation datasets at 11 stations over the arid inland Heihe River basin in Northwest China from 1960 to 2011. Eight indices of extreme precipitation are studied. The results show statistically significant and large-magnitude increasing and decreasing trends for most indices, primarily in the Qilian Mountains and eastern Hexi Corridor. More frequent and intense rainfall extremes have occurred in the southern part of the desert area than in the northern portion. In general, the temporal variation in precipitation extremes has changed throughout the basin. Wet day precipitation and heavy precipitation days show statistically significant linear increasing trends and step changes in the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor. Consecutive dry days have decreased obviously in the region in most years after approximately the late 1980s, but meanwhile very long dry spells have increased, especially in the Hexi Corridor. The probability density function indicates that very long wet spells have increased in the QilianMountains. The East Asian summer monsoon index and western Pacific subtropical high intensity index possess strong and significant negative and positive correlations with rainfall extremes, respectively. Changes in land surface characteristics and the increase in water vapor in the wet season have also contributed to the changes in precipitation extremes over the river basin.</p>\n                  ",

Although there have been many studies of tropopause folds that have occurred over Europe and North America, a very limited amount of work has been carried out over northeastern Asia. Ozonesondes produced by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics were launched in Changchun (43.9\u00b0N, 125.2\u00b0E), Northeast China, in June 2013, and observed an ozone-enriched layer with thickness of 3 km and an ozone peak of 180 ppbv at 6 km in the troposphere. The circulation field from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) dataset shows that this ozone peak was caused by a tropopause fold associated with a jet stream at the eastern flank of the East Asian trough. By analyzing the ozone data from the ozone monitoring instrument and Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations, it was found that a high ozone concentration tongue originating from the lower stratosphere at high latitude (near central Siberia) intruded into the middle troposphere over Changchun between 5 and 8 km on 12 June 2013. The high-resolution WRF-Chem simulation was capable of describing events such as the tropopause fold that occurred on the cyclonic shear side of the jet stream. In addition, the TRAJ3D trajectory model was used to trace the origin of measured secondary ozone peaks in the middle troposphere back, for example, to stratospheric intrusion through the tropopause fold.</p>\n                  ",

Long-term, continuous flux measurements help in better understanding the seasonal and interannual variation of the carbon budget over R\u2013W rotation systems. In this study, measurements of CO<sub class=\"a-plus-plus\">2</sub> fluxes and meteorological variables over an R\u2013W rotation system on the North China Plain from 2007 to 2010 were analyzed. To analyze the abiotic factors regulating Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), NEE was partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration. Nighttime NEE or ecosystem respiration was controlled primarily by soil temperature, while daytime NEE was mainly determined by photosythetically active radiation (PAR). The responses of nighttime NEE to soil temperature and daytime NEE to light were closely associated with crop development and photosynthetic activity, respectively. Moreover, the interannual variation in GPP and NEE mainly depended on precipitation and PAR. Overall, NEE was negative on the annual scale and the rotation system behaved as a carbon sink of 982 g C m<sup class=\"a-plus-plus\">-2</sup> per year over the three years. The winter wheat field took up more CO<sub class=\"a-plus-plus\">2</sub> than the rice paddy during the longer growing season, while the daily NEE for wheat and rice were -2.35 and -3.96 g C m<sup class=\"a-plus-plus\">-2</sup>, respectively.

The results show that this atypical occlusion process was significantly different from the traditional, synoptic-scale occlusion process that occurs within extratropical cyclones. It was caused by the merger of two cold-type mesoscale fronts. One of the fronts developed from the gust front of convective storms, while the other was a sea-breeze front. As the two fronts moved towards each other, the warm air between them was squeezed and separated from the surface. An atypical occluded front was formed when the two fronts merged, with the warm air forced aloft. This kind of occlusion is termed a \u201cmerger\u201d process, different from the well-known \u201ccatch-up\u201d and \u201cwrap-up\u201d processes.

The large-scale lateral boundary forcing was derived from an ensemble reanalysis dataset and decomposed into climatological, SY, IS, and IA components. The PLF experiments show that the IS forcing not only triggers the monsoon onset and drives two northward propagation events of the subtropical front but also has dominant contributions to the two heaviest rainfall events over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) and South China, suggesting the critical role of the intra-seasonal variability in the devastating 1998 floods. Previous studies perceived that the northward propagating IS oscillation from the tropics regulates the extreme heavy rainfall of East Asia summer monsoon in 1998. However, we find that the IS forcing from the mid-latitude plays a more important role than the forcing from the tropics in generating the two extreme rainfall events in 1998. During the first extreme event in June, the IS forcing across the western boundary is the major cause of the northward advance of the subtropical front and the heavy rainfall over the YRB and South China, with the IS forcing across the northern boundary providing the second largest contribution. During the second extreme event (July 15\u2013August 5), the IS forcing from the eastern boundary plays a dominant role in driving the southward retreat and northward advance of the subtropical front, causing another heavy rainfall over the YRB and South China. The western and northern IS forcing also has large contributions to the second extreme event. We have estimated the contributions to the seasonal anomalous rainfall by the three types of forcing. The SY forcing tends to have a moderate effect on the YRB rainfall but significant reduction of the rainfall in South China. The IS forcing has dominant contributions to the seasonal-mean rainfall anomalies over all three sub-regions of China (North China, the YRB, and South China). The IA forcing mainly enhances the rainfall in South China but reduces the precipitation in the YRB slightly. This study portends a promising application of regional climate models to identify key factors causing extreme climate events. The PLF methodology can be used to study a broad range of climate phenomena and to understand the effects of variety of dynamic and physical processes in climate variability and predictability.</p>\n                  ",

Previous Holocene EAWM proxy data records, which were mostly located in Central, Eastern and Southern China, did not show a consistent Holocene EAWM history. Therefore, it is difficult to provide insights into mechanisms of the long-term winter monsoon variability on the basis of the records. Eolian sediments at the southern edge of the Gobi Desert, Western China, are sensitive to the EAWM changes and less affected by the East Asian summer monsoon due to an obstruction of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau. This paper presents a comparison between a well-dated Holocene EAWM record and coupled climate model simulations, so as to explore physical processes and influencing factors of the Holocene EAWM. Sediment samples from two Holocene eolian sedimentary sections [Huangyanghe (a) and Huangyanghe (b)] were acquired at the southern edge of the Gobi Desert. Chronologies were established based on twenty bulk organic matter AMS <sup class=\"a-plus-plus\">14</sup>C ages and five pollen concentrates AMS <sup class=\"a-plus-plus\">14</sup>C ages. Proxy data, including grain-size, total organic carbon, magnetic susceptibility and carbonate content were obtained from the two eolian sections. The grain-size standard deviation model was applied to determine components sensitive to variability of the Holocene EAWM. After a comparison of environmentally-sensitive grain-size components and proxy data, the 20\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm component at the Huangyanghe (a) and the 20\u2013159\u00a0\u03bcm component at the Huangyanghe (b) section were selected as indicators of the Holocene EAWM, which show a strong early Holocene winter monsoon and a decline of the winter monsoon since the mid-Holocene. We also present equilibrium and transient simulations of the climate evolution for the Holocene using a state-of-art coupled climate model: the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Indices for the Holocene EAWM were calculated and are consistent with the reconstructed Holocene EAWM intensity. The simulations indicate that orbital forcing effects on the land-sea temperature and sea level pressure contrast can account for the observed EAWM trends. Other forcings that were present in the early Holocene, including the remnant Laurentide ice sheet and meltwater forcing in the North Atlantic, were not responsible for the Holocene trends.</p>\n                  ",

The synergistic effect of summer precipitation over the South China Sea (SCS) region (18\u00b0\u201327\u00b0N, 115\u00b0\u2013124\u00b0E) and the northwestern India and Arabian Sea (IAS) region (18\u00b0\u201327\u00b0N, 60\u00b0\u201380\u00b0E) contributes more significantly to the variation of summer YRV temperature, relative to the respective SCS or IAS precipitation anomaly. More precipitation (enhanced condensational heating) over the SCS region strengthens the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and simultaneously weakens the westerly trough over the east coast of Asia, and accordingly results in associated high temperature anomalies over the YRV region through stimulating an East Asia-Pacific (EAP) pattern. More precipitation over the IAS region further adjusts the variations of the WPSH and westerly trough, and eventually reinforces high temperature anomalies over the YRV region. Furthermore, the condensational heating related to more IAS precipitation can adjust upper-tropospheric easterly anomalies over the YRV region by exciting a circumglobal teleconnection, inducing cold horizontal temperature advection and related anomalous descent, which is also conducive to the YRV high temperature anomalies. The reproduction of the above association in the model results indicates that the above results can be explained both statistically and dynamically.</p>\n                  ",

In the present study, turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) parameters are analyzed for different conditions with respect to stability, wind direction and wind speed over a valley region of the Loess Plateau of China during December 2003 and January 2004. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the observed turbulence intensity and TKE parameters satisfy Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), and analyze the wind shear effect on, and thermal buoyancy function of, the TKE, despite the terrain heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that the normalized intensity of turbulence follows MOST for all stability in the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as the normalized TKE in the horizontal direction. The shear effect of the wind speed in the Loess Plateau region is strong in winter and could enhance turbulence for all stability conditions. During daytime, the buoyancy and shear effect together constitute the generation of TKE under unstable conditions. At night, the contribution of buoyancy to TKE is relatively small, and mechanical shearing is the main production form of turbulence.</p>\n                  ",

Most of the models have the capacity to capture the AMJ precipitation variability in the SCS. The precipitation and SST anomaly (SSTA) distribution in the SCS, tropical Pacific Ocean (TPO), and tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) domains is evaluated based on the pattern correlation coefficients between model simulations and observations. The analysis leads to several points of note. First, the performance of the SCS precipitation anomaly pattern in AMJ is model dependent. Second, the SSTA pattern in the TPO and TIO is important for capturing the AMJ SCS precipitation variability. Third, a realistic simulation of the western equatorial Pacific (WEP) and local SST impacts is necessary for reproducing the AMJ SCS precipitation variability in some models. Fourth, the overly strong WEP SST impacts may disrupt the relationship between the SCS precipitation and the TPO-TIO SST.

The number of heavy precipitation events (&amp;gt;10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>day<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup>) was the most important PEC to impact GPP in the temperate steppe. Years with more frequent heavy precipitation events favored higher GPP. However, in contrast with the case in the temperate steppe, precipitation interval was the factor that affected GPP most in the alpine meadow. GPP was higher as the precipitation intervals lengthened or their distribution shifted to fewer but longer intervals (concentrated distribution). Additionally, the mechanisms for the effects of PEC on GPP also differed between these two ecosystems. Compared with small events, heavy precipitation events recharged deeper soil layers in the temperate steppe, which was biologically more meaningful for plant transpiration (i.e., an increase in the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration), relief from drought stress (an increase in the duration of high soil water content), and thereby higher GPP. In contrast, mean air temperature was higher in the alpine meadow when the precipitation intervals increased or their distribution was more concentrated, leading to a longer period of higher temperature that was favorable to higher GPP. Our results imply that soil water is not the exclusive means of revealing the mechanism of precipitation affecting productivity; the corresponding changes in temperature along with precipitation events may also play a substantial role in temperature-limited grasslands.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

As cold biomes in high-altitude ecoregions, they have drawn a growing concern of the potential vulnerability to current and future climate change. In this study, we retrieved the time series (2000\u20132013) of satellite-based phenological transitions (the onset and offset of vegetative growth) for subalpine shrubs at five individual sites in the Qilian Mountains in northwestern China. Our goals were to identify the climatic constraints on the timing of leaf-out and leaf-fall, and to project these phenological patterns under the future climate conditions. To achieve these goals, the relationships between these regional phenological events and climate variables were investigated with univariate and multivariate time series models, and the future phenological dynamics were forecasted for two decades based on the best predictive models under the A2 and B2 of IPCCs Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Our results generally revealed site-dependent phenology\u2013climate relationships, which involved an immediate phenological response to the mean or minimum temperature in the corresponding month of occurrence, and a lagged cumulative climate effect across preceding months and seasons. Average temperature during a certain period has been demonstrated as an important limiting factor for plant growth. However, our results also provided evidence for the minimum temperature controls of the development of phenological events in subalpine shrublands, possibly due to a close association with the frequency of frost risk in spring and autumn. Under future climate conditions, an overall lengthening of the active growing season is expected at each of the study sites depending on elevation. Consequently, net carbon uptake by shrubs will benefit from the increased temperature.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A common measure to protect soil against erosion is afforestation. There is growing evidence that mixed-species forest stands have beneficial effects on ecosystem functions (growth rates, nutrient cycling). In addition, species-rich forests tend to have higher and denser crown cover and thus might affect soil erosion. This study investigated the role of tree species richness on throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) as an important part of the soil erosion process and examined the spatial variability of TKE in mixed-species forest stands.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0070\" view=\"all\">The research was conducted within BEF-China, a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China.

This is likely due to the young age of the experimental forest where a dense and high tree canopy has not yet been developed. However, TKE was influenced by neighborhood tree species richness indicating that tree species richness only affected TKE on a small spatial scale within the direct neighborhood in young forests.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0080\" view=\"all\">TKE showed distinct spatial variability.

Mean freefall kinetic energy (FKE) was 480<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>J/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>. Lower TKE below the first branch than FKE can be attributed to low rain drop velocities due to short falling heights. Higher TKE in the middle of four tree individuals than FKE can be ascribed to a larger crown area on which drops can confluence resulting in an increase of drop mass. Furthermore, TKE was positively affected by the number of influencing tree individuals with a 13% increase of TKE from one to four influencing tree individuals. However, further investigation on TKE below mature trees and dense canopies is needed to confirm our findings for later successional stages.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate the rainstorm under the background of binary typhoons of Fitow and Danas. Three sensitivity experiments of typhoon intensity changes of binary typhoons were carried out. It was found that the Typhoon Danas was the main factor in this torrential rain event, in which its accompanied strong eastward low-level jet was the major moisture conveyor belt through which the warm and moist air was brought into the heavy rainfall zone and the static instability was maintained and enhanced over the YRD. The convergence line formed by periphery easterly flow of Typhoon Danas and southward cold air, together with the local frontogenesis mainly due to convergence, was an important trigger factor of this rainstorm. The large scale forcing was the major uplift mechanism, and the underlying frontal uplift played a secondary role for rainstorm in the north YRD, while uplift mechanism for rainstorm in the southern YRD is mainly local underlying frontal uplift induced large CAPE release resulting in local strong buoyancy uplift that led to strong upward motion. Not only did the convergence of twin typhoons directly provide dynamic conditions for the rainstorm, but also the dynamic lifting was enhanced by binary typhoons through strengthening the coupling of upper-level and low-level jet. The sensitivity tests revealed that the rainstorm in YRD was sensitive to both typhoons' intensity, and the rainfall in the south YRD was more sensitive than that in the north. A conceptual model of YRD rainstorm under binary typhoon situation was proposed based on the above-mentioned factors.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Annual SPI series exhibited a decreasing trend at 86 stations and an increasing trend at the remaining stations. None of the increasing trend was significant, while the decreasing trend was significant at two stations at 5% significance level (\u03b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) and one station at 10% level.

However, air quality plummeted during the post-APEC period (Nov. 12\u201330), which was largely related to the lifting of local and regional joint emission control measures. By applying a spatial correlation analysis method, the potential emission source regions impacting air quality of Beijing included widespread areas in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Tianjin in the past three years (2011\u20132013). While during the study period in 2014, areas impacting Beijing evidently shrank and were limited within Hebei, suggesting evident effects of intense emission perturbations on lowering the extent of regional transport.

Sea level anomalies (SLAs) in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are assumed to be governed by various phenomena associated with the adjacent parts of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. We have used monthly sea level anomalies obtained from 12 tide gauge stations of PSMSL and UHSLC and merged and gridded AVISO products of SLAs (sea level anomalies) derived from satellite altimeter. We find that IOD-influenced inter-annual variations are found only in the southwestern and southeastern coastal regions of SSCS. Our analysis reveals that inter-annual regional sea level drops are associated with positive phase of the IOD, and the rises with negative phase of the IOD. SLA variations at decadal scale in the southeastern and northern Gulf of Thailand correlate with Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO). Multiple linear regression analysis of inter-annual SLAs and climate indices shows that IOD induced inter-annual variations dominate in the southwestern SCS and it contributes to about ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40% of inter-annual sea level variation. Meanwhile, ENSO contributes to around ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30% variation in sea level in the southwestern and ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40% variation in the southeastern SSCS.

Here, we examine the functional diversity of a Middle Triassic paleocommunity in the wake of the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, the Permo-Triassic mass extinction (PTME). Field data was collected and analyzed for a highly diverse invertebrate marine fossil assemblage, the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Leidapo Member (Qingyan Formation) of Qingyan, south China. Previously interpreted to represent a fully restructured paleocommunity in the aftermath of the PTME, our results indicate that the fauna of Leidapo Member had high taxonomic diversity and high functional richness, however was functionally uneven. Despite the presence of 24 different functional groups, the paleocommunity was numerically and ecologically dominated by one functional group consisting of mostly attached epifaunal suspension feeding brachiopods. The overwhelming dominance of this Anisian paleocommunity by one functional group implies that either, 1) resource availability in the community was uneven, and/or 2) strong environmental or niche filtering was in effect. As such, while the Anisian Leidapo Member paleocommunity was deposited in a fairly stable shallow water paleoenvironment, this biotic assemblage would have been very vulnerable to biotic and environmental perturbations. While it is uncertain whether or not this pattern is typical of paleocommunities in the aftermath of the PTME, these results imply that some Anisian paleocommunities may not have been as fully restructured as previously thought, and may have been inherently unstable due to the numerous biotic and environmental changes present in the Triassic.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In this study, we systematically analyzed the changes in the mean and extreme values for temperature and precipitation over the Loess Plateau between 1961 and 2011, using a gridded dataset with high-density gauge data. Statistically significant positive trends (<italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) in the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature values (TM, TX, and TN) were identified in almost all regions. Warming rates increased from the southeast to the northwest of the Loess Plateau for both TM and TN; however, for TX, the greatest warming increases were observed in the southeast region. We also found general decreases in the diurnal temperature range and the number of cold nights and cold days, and increases in the length of the growing season and the number of warm days and warm nights. Moreover, relatively intense changes occurred in the high percentile ranges for both TX and TN. The total amount of precipitation on wet days decreased over a large area of the Loess Plateau, particularly in the southeast region. The inequality in the spread of precipitation over the year (temporal inequality) increased extensively over the past fifty years in the wet region. Approximately 37.60% of the total area with a reduced amount of precipitation had concurrent decreases in both the frequency and intensity of rainfall. However, approximately 37.20% of the area with a reduced amount of precipitation had decreases in the frequency but increases in the intensity of rainfall. The proportion of days with light or moderate precipitation was decreased in the wet region which mainly located in the southwest of the Loess Plateau, but there were only minor changes in extreme precipitation events. Overall, when both temperature and precipitation changes were combined, we observed that the southwest of the Loess Plateau has undergone the largest degree of climate change. Consequently, both the ecological environment and local agriculture on the Loess Plateau will suffer increased challenges: the decline in water availability will lead to more frequent droughts, yet the risk of flood and soil erosion from extreme precipitation events will not be reduced.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Accordingly, we evaluated the influences of core direction, tree age, tree size, growth rate and species on the climate\u2013growth relationships of 210 tree-ring cores from Kongtong Mountain and Xiaolong Mountain on the semi-arid Chinese Loess Plateau. We employed both the linear methods of correlation and response function analyses, and the nonlinear method of the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). Most trees are sensitive to the moisture availability. Old trees are more sensitive to drought than young trees, which may be related to the intensified hydraulic resistances and reduced photosynthesis in response to drought. Tree cores taken from the southern direction are often more sensitive to drought than cores taken from other directions. The enhanced drought sensitivity for the southern cores may be possibly related to more branches and leaves for photosynthesis. Slow-growing trees show higher correlations with precipitation of the September prior to growth. This indicates that the extremely stressed, slow-growing trees tend to rely largely on nutrients produced prior to the growing season. For the reconstructions of annual drought in this region, we suggest collecting tree cores from the southern side of old trees growing at stressed sites.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, intensification of droughts and floods and amplification of precipitation extremes are having critical negative impacts on agriculture. In this study, flood- and drought-affected, flood- and drought-damaged crop areas, and also flood- and drought-induced agricultural loss from 29 provinces across China are analyzed in both space and time. Results indicate the following: (1) Large parts of China are dominated by intensified floods. Comparatively, spatial ranges dominated by intensifying drought hazards are smaller than those by intensifying flood hazards. (2) Drought intensity is increasing in northwest China with moderate changes in the degree of influence. Increasing flood intensity can be observed in northwest, southwest and central China. However, flood risks are higher in arid regions such as northwest China and drought risks are higher in humid regions such as southwest China. (3) Agreements are identified between abrupt behaviors of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas. The change points of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas is in the 1980s in northeast, north and central China and in the 1990s in south and southwest China. Nevertheless, spatial patterns of the change points in the drought-affected and -destroyed crop areas are sporadic but not confirmative. (4) Flood- and drought-induced losses of agricultural production have significant increasing trends in most parts of China. The loss rate and loss magnitude of agriculture before change points are significantly higher than those after change points. (5) Generally, amplifications of precipitation extremes, decreasing consecutive wet days and increasing consecutive dry days in both space and time are the major driving factors behind the changes of drought- and flood-affected, and -destroyed crop areas and their impacts on agriculture across China. These results are theoretically and practically relevant for planning and management of agricultural activities and may help provide a theoretical framework for similar studies in other regions of the globe.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Based on an analysis of the forest change history of China, we devised a reconstruction method for the historical forest cover in China. The core idea of the method is that the lands with high suitability for cultivation will be cultivated and deforested first, spreading to marginal lands with lower suitability for cultivation. By determining the possible maximum distribution extent of the forest, as well as devising the land suitability for cultivation assessment model and provincial forest area allocation model, we created 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km forest cover maps of China for the years 1700 to 2000 with 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>year intervals. By comparison with satellite-based data in 2000, we found that the grids within 25% differences account for as much as 66.07% of all grids. The comparison with the historical documents-based data in northeast China indicated that the number of counties within 30% relative differences is 99, accounting for 74.44% of all counties. Therefore, the forest area allocation model we devised can accurately reproduce the spatial patterns of historical forest cover in China. Our reconstruction indicates that from 1700 to the 1960s, the deforestation mainly occurred in southwest China, the hilly regions of south China, the southeast of Gansu province, and northeast China; from the 1960s to 2000, the reforestation occurred in most traditional forested regions of China, particularly in the Tibet Plateau, hilly regions of south China and the Greater Khingan Mountains. The spatially explicit forest cover data sets we reconstructed can be used in global or regional climatic models to study the impact of land cover change on climate change.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Contrary to the existing chronologies that are mostly temperature sensitive, this chronology contained a strong February\u2013April precipitation signal, indicating great potential for tree-ring based precipitation reconstructions in southeastern China. The reconstruction explained 47.8% of the instrumental variance during 1951\u20132012.

The major findings are as follows: (1) The soil temperature precipitation (ST P) coupling is quite weak and spatially scattered from both RegCM4 output and GLDAS data in each season with the only obvious signals existing over the north India region in summer season according to the RegCM4 output; the soil temperature 2m air temperature (ST T2m) coupling is strong and spatially continuous with the India (in spring, summer and autumn seasons), South Indochina (in spring and summer seasons) and part of North China (in summer season) standing out as hotspots. (2) The soil temperature evapotranspiration (ST ET) and soil temperature evaporative fraction (ST EF) coupling almost resembles the same spatial patterns and magnitude in each season. Both the ET and EF play an important role in linking ST P coupling in each season, but not in the ST T2m coupling. The hotspots of ST T2m coupling outweigh the areas with strong ST ET and ST EF coupling. Only the India and Indochina in each season are recognized by the RegCM4 while the Indochina and west Asia in spring, north India, Indochina and part of mid-high latitudes in summer season pinpointed by GLDAS data show consistent strong ST T2m coupling with significant ST ET and ST EF coupling. This finding demonstrates the complicated ST Atm coupling. (3) The ST anomalies prescribed at the first step of each season can only persist a short time (within 5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days) over most part of the study area while the fixed one-month anomalies can last longer (approximately 2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>months with colder anomalies and 45<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days with warmer anomalies in tropical regions). (4) The impact of ST anomalies on subsequent precipitation is quite weak and can be ignored over most part of the study area, while the impact on subsequent T2m is obvious and spatially continuous. The spatial patterns for the changes of climate variables (e.g., latent heat flux (LH), sensible heat flux (SH), ET, T2m) are almost consistent with the changes of ST over most part of the study area (except India and Indochina in spring and autumn seasons) where warmer (colder) ST anomalies lead to increase (decrease) of LH, SH, ET and T2m, demonstrating the important role of land atmosphere interactions in the locale climate. Over the India and Indochina, the large-scale circulation dominates the local climate in spring and autumn seasons. (5) The impact of colder ST anomalies can last longer than the warmer ones. Among the spring, summer and autumn seasons, the impact persists shortest in summer and longest in autumn, especially over the India region.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study analyzed the wetlands in Shanghai, a province-level city, using remote sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques based on the Chinese national wetland inventory procedure and standards. FORMOSAT imagery acquired in 2012 and Navy nautical charts of the Yangtze estuarine area were used in conjunction with object-oriented segmentation, expert interpretation, and field validation to determine wetland status. Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2013 as well as social-economic data collected from 1985 to 2013 were used to further assess wetland changes. In 2013, Shanghai contained 376970.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha of wetlands, and 78.8% of all wetlands were in marine or estuarine systems. Estuarine waters comprised the single largest wetland category. Between the first national wetland inventory in 2003 and the second national wetland inventory in 2013, Shanghai lost 50519.1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ha of wetlands, amounting to a mean annual loss rate of 1.2% or an 11.8% loss over the decade. Declines were proportionately higher in marine and estuarine wetlands, with an annual loss of 1.8%, while there was a sharp increase of 1882.6% in constructed water storage areas for human uses. Diking, filling, impoundment and reclamation, which are all attributable to the economic development and urbanization associated with population increases, were the major factors that explained the gain and loss of wetlands. Additional factors affecting wetland losses and gains include sediment trapping by the hydropower system, which reduces supply to the estuary and erodes wetlands, and sediment trapping by the jetties, spur dikes, and diversion bulwark associated with a navigation channel deepening project, which has the converse effect, increasing saltmarsh wetland area at Jiuduansha shoal by three times between 2000 and 2013.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The objectives of the study were: first, to establish a conceptual hydrogeological model of the karst groundwater system; second, to estimate the proportion of extra glacier melt water infiltrating the karst aquifer that is being induced by the regional climate warming; third, to calculate the karst-related flux of carbon into the karst aquifer. Knowledge of the local hydrogeological background from previous work was the starting point of the hydrochemical and stable isotopic study. Some representative spring waters and recharge waters (i.e. glacier melt water and rainwater) were investigated both spatially and temporally by hydrochemical and isotopic techniques, including analysis of major and some minor ions and O and H stable isotopes. A conceptual hydrogeological model of a fracture-diffuse flow karst groundwater aquifer was proposed. The proportion of glacier melt water infiltrating into the karst aquifer was estimated by using the karst spring as a natural pluviometer, and with stable isotope analysis. Results show that (1) the JDSM karst aquifer is a diffuse flow system; (2) it has a number of discharge areas, and the Jinsha River is the karst drainage base level; (3) the proportion of the glacier melt water penetrating the karst aquifer is 29%; and (4) the karst-related carbon sink is 26.67<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>3.44<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>t<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km<sup loc=\"post\">\u22122</sup> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>a<sup loc=\"post\">\u22121</sup> (as CO<inf loc=\"post\">2</inf>), which is lower than that in non-glacierized karst aquifers but over ten times larger than the carbon sink flux from silicate weathering in non-karst areas, showing the control of both climate and lithology on the rock weathering-related carbon sink and the significance of carbonate weathering in the global carbon cycle.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This is particularly true in water resource studies that depend on model-based assessments of alternative management strategies. In recent decades, Bayesian data assimilation methods have been widely used in hydrology to assess uncertain model parameters and predictions. In this case study, a particular data assimilation algorithm, the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA) (Emerick and Reynolds, 2012), is used to derive posterior samples of uncertain model parameters and forecasts for a distributed hydrological model of Yanqi basin, China. This model is constructed using MIKESHE/MIKE11software, which provides for coupling between surface and subsurface processes (<cross-refs refid=\"b0060 b0065 b0070 b0075\" id=\"r8005\">DHI, 2011a\u2013d</cross-refs>). The random samples in the posterior parameter ensemble are obtained by using measurements to update 50 prior parameter samples generated with a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) procedure. The posterior forecast samples are obtained from model runs that use the corresponding posterior parameter samples. Two iterative sample update methods are considered: one based on an a perturbed observation Kalman filter update and one based on a square root Kalman filter update. These alternatives give nearly the same results and converge in only two iterations. The uncertain parameters considered include hydraulic conductivities, drainage and river leakage factors, van Genuchten soil property parameters, and dispersion coefficients. The results show that the uncertainty in many of the parameters is reduced during the smoother updating process, reflecting information obtained from the observations. Some of the parameters are insensitive and do not benefit from measurement information. The correlation coefficients among certain parameters increase in each iteration, although they generally stay below 0.50.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

To solve the problem, four different hydrology products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, model simulations from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) in conjunction with in-situ measurements, are utilized to investigate patterns and underlying causes of TWS and its component changes. An excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration (ET) plus runoff contributes to an increase of TWS. The phase of Total Soil Moisture (TSM) lags that of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), indicating a recharge from snowmelt to TSM.

Incorporation of uncertainty assessment within hydrological models can facilitate the calibration process and improve the degree of credibility to the subsequent prediction. In this study, an inexact-variance hydrological modeling system (IVHMS) is developed for assessing parameter uncertainty on modeling outputs in the Kaidu River Basin, China. Through incorporating the techniques of type-2 fuzzy analysis (T2FA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) within the semi-distributed land use based runoff processes (SLURP) model, IVHMS can quantitatively evaluate the individual and interactive effects of multiple uncertain parameters expressed as type-2 fuzzy sets in the hydrological modeling system. The modeling outputs indicate a good performance of SLURP model in describing the daily streamflow at the Dashankou hydrological station. Uncertainty analysis is conducted through sampling from fuzzy membership functions under different \u03b1-cut levels. The results show that, under a lower degree of plausibility (i.e. a lower \u03b1-cut level), intervals for peak and average flows are both wider; while intervals of peak and average flows become narrower under a higher degree of plausibility. Results based on ANOVA reveal that (i) precipitation factor (PF), one of main factors dominating the runoff processes, should be paid more attention in order to enhance the model performance; (ii) retention constant for fast store (RS) controls the amount and timing of the outflow from saturated zone and has a highly nonlinear effect on the average flow; (iii) the interaction between retention constant for fast store (RF) and maximum capacity for fast store (MF) has statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) effect on modeling outputs through affecting the maximum water holding capacity and the soil infiltration rate.

The smallest seasonal averaged AOD appears mostly in autumn.

Until now, the uncertainties in net climate forcing from severe aerosol pollutions in China are substantial, largely due to the lack of detailed knowledge of radiative properties of severe aerosol pollutions. Here the characteristics of aerosols under severe aerosol pollution days (APs) in Beijing are studied by analyzing the ground-based radiance measurements during the period from 2002 to 2014. We show that the mean single scattering albedo (SSA) values increase by 0.03\u20130.06 (7%) in APs, and the mean asymmetry (ASY) parameter values increase by 0.03\u20130.04 (6%) for the four wavelengths of 440\u20131020\u00a0nm. The atmospheric forcing of the APs is 2 times higher than that in other days. Contrary to the RF values, the radiative forcing efficiencies in the APs are 38% lower than those in the other days. Larger values of SSA and ASY under APs represent larger presence of more scattering aerosols and irregular-sized aerosols such as dust and non-absorbing fine mode particles. These particles are also verified by the much lower radiative forcing efficiency values. Analyses are applied on the dataset of the APs over Beijing, to group them into four discrete clusters. The two fine-size absorbing aerosols show larger mean atmospheric radiative forcing values (152.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 184.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> respectively) and forcing efficiency values (83.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and 108.5\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> respectively). The non-absorbing aerosols and coarse aerosols exert large planetary cooling (\u221286.7\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup> and\u00a0\u221277.3\u00a0W/m<sup loc=\"post\">2</sup>) and low atmospheric heating effect.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The long-term trend and spatiotemporal variations of haze over China during recent 30 years are investigated using TOMS AAI products. In addition, the heavy haze events that occurred in January 2013 over eastern China are explored using AAI products from TOU on board FY-3A. Validation results show that satellite AAI products can be used for haze monitoring since it is sensitive to the carbonaceous aerosol, which is one of the main components of haze. In China, the high AAI values (&amp;gt;1.0) mainly located in the main four areas with intense anthropogenic activities, except for the desert region in Northwestern China. In the eastern and northeastern region, AAI peaks dominate in spring before 2005 since those areas were always affected by dust in spring. However, after 2005, AAI peaks appear in winter over eastern China because of haze. Moreover, in the northeastern region, AAI peaks dominate in winter with a secondary peak in spring because this area is affected by both dust and haze. In the southern region, the AAI peaks always dominate in spring since the high-level air pollution\u00a0often occur in spring, but a decreasing trend is acquired during recent ten years. Over eastern China and northeastern China, AAI shows an increasing trend during recent 30 years in winter, which reveals that the haze over these areas is strengthen.

To address that issue, to date, a series of studies is in progress, including PM monitoring programs, PM source apportionment, and the enactment of new ambient air quality index standards. However, related research concerning computer modeling for PM future trends estimation is rare, despite its significance to forecasting and early warning systems. Thereby, a study regarding deterministic and interval forecasts of PM is performed. In this study, data on hourly and 12\u00a0h-averaged air pollutants are applied to forecast PM concentrations within the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China. The characteristics of PM emissions have been primarily examined and analyzed using different distribution functions. To improve the distribution fitting that is crucial for estimating PM levels, an artificial intelligence algorithm is incorporated to select the optimal parameters. Following that step, an ANF model is used to conduct deterministic forecasts of PM. With the identified distributions and deterministic forecasts, different levels of PM intervals are estimated. The results indicate that the lognormal or gamma distributions are highly representative of the recorded PM data with a goodness-of-fit <italic>R</italic> <sup loc=\"post\"> <italic>2</italic> </sup> of approximately 0.998.

In this work, sources of OC and EC are investigated using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM<inf loc=\"post\">2.5</inf> chemical composition data, including major ions, OC, EC, elements, and organic molecular source markers, for a set of 156 filter samples collected over three years from 2010 to 2012 at Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta, China.

Using these species as input for the PMF model, nine factors were resolved.

Inclusion of C<inf loc=\"post\">27</inf>\u2013C<inf loc=\"post\">33</inf> <italic>n</italic>-alkanes and PAHs can influence the source profiles resolved by PMF and thereby affect the source contributions to OC and EC. Considerably more OC (44% vs. 27% of OC) was apportioned to the secondary factors when only major components were considered in comparison with the PMF analysis with the full suite of organic tracers, mainly at the expense of coal combustion and industrial emissions. EC apportionment to the few major combustion sources was found more sensitive to inclusion of organic tracers than OC apportionment, with PAHs playing a prominent role.

A significant positive correlation (at a 99% confidence level) was found between the summer precipitation anomaly and the intensity of the QBW and ISO modes in the region. By examining the composite structure and evolution characteristics, we note that the QBW mode is characterized by a northwest\u2013southeast oriented wave train pattern, moving southeastward. The perturbations associated with the ISO mode propagate northwestward in strong ISO years but southeastward in weak ISO years. A marked feature is the phase leading of low-level moisture to convection in both the QBW and ISO mode. When the summer rainfall is strong in the ChangJiang Valley, large-scale atmospheric conditions in the strong QBW/ISO activity region are characterized by deeper moist layer, convectively more unstable stratification and greater ascending motion. Such mean conditions favor the growth of the QBW and ISO perturbations. Thus, a significant positive correlation between the summer precipitation and the strength of sub-seasonal variability arises from the large-scale control of the summer mean flow to perturbations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

SHRL variations from 1990 to 2011 are subdivided into three categories, while parameter differences relating to three differing models are examined. Dynamical characteristics of SHRL are analyzed and an aberrance mechanism subsequently developed. Modeling suggests that different parameters may lead to significant variance pertaining to monsoon variables corresponding with numerous WPSH activities. Dynamical system bifurcation and mutation indicates that the South China Sea monsoon trough is a significant factor with respect to the occurrence and maintenance of the \u2018double-ridge\u2019 phenomenon.

Leaf shape is a key determinant of both function and structural diversity of plants, but relatively little is known about the tempo and mode of leaf morphological diversification and its correlation with tracheophyte diversity and abiotic changes during this remarkable macroevolutionary event, the greening of the continents. We use the extensive record of Paleozoic tracheophytes from South China to explore models of morphological evolution in early land plants. Our findings suggest that tracheophyte leaf disparity and diversity were decoupled, and that they were under different selective regimes. Two key phases in the evolution of South Chinese tracheophyte leaves can be recognized. In the first phase, from Devonian to Mississippian, taxic diversity increased substantially, as did leaf disparity, at the same time as they acquired novel features in their vascular systems, reproductive organs, and overall architecture. The second phase, through the Carboniferous\u2013Permian transition, saw recovery of wetland communities in South China, associated with a further expansion of morphologies of simple leaves and an offset shift in morphospace occupation by compound leaves. Comparison with Euramerica suggests that the floras from South China were unique in several ways. The Late Devonian radiation of sphenophyllaleans contributed significantly to the expansion of leaf morphospace, such that the evolution of large laminate leaves in this group occurred much earlier than those in Euramerica. The Pennsylvanian decrease in taxic richness had little effect on the disparity of compound leaves. Finally, the distribution in morphospace of the Permian pecopterids, gigantopterids, and equisetaleans occurred at the periphery of Carboniferous leaf morphospace.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

It has been found that a significantly enhanced East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is characterized by increased rainfall in northern China and by reduced rainfall in southern China, and this relationship occurs on different time scales during the Holocene. This study presents results from a diverse range of proxy paleoclimatic records from northern China where precipitation variability is traditionally considered as an EASM proxy. Our aim is to evaluate the evolution of the EASM during the Holocene and to compare it with all of the published stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the Asian monsoon region in order to explore the potential mechanism(s) controlling the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O. We found that the intensity of the EASM during the Holocene recorded by the traditional EASM proxy of moisture (or precipitation) records from northern China is significantly different from the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records. The EASM maximum occurred during the mid-Holocene, challenging the prevailing view of an early Holocene EASM maximum mainly inferred from stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in eastern China. In addition, all of the well-dated Holocene stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records, covering a broad geographical region, exhibit a remarkably similar trend of variation and are statistically well-correlated on different time scales, thus indicating a common signal. However, in contrast with the clear consistency in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in all of the cave records, both instrumental and paleoclimatic records exhibit significant spatial variations in rainfall on decadal-to-centennial time scales over eastern China. In addition, both paleoclimatic records and modeling results suggest that Holocene East Asian summer monsoon precipitation reached a maximum at different periods in different regions of China. Thus the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, modern observations indicate that the moisture for precipitation in the East Asian monsoon region is mainly derived from the Indian Ocean. The moisture transport route from the Indian Ocean to the East Asian monsoon region during the Holocene is almost identical to that of modern precipitation. Therefore the strong correlation of \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in the EASM and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regions, and the similarity of the pattern of latitudinal changes in \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in stalagmites and in modern meteoric precipitation along the water vapor transport route, further suggests that the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region are essentially a signal of the isotopic composition of precipitation, which is determined mainly by changes in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O of atmospheric vapor in the upstream source region over the Indian Ocean and Indian Monsoon region via the upstream depletion mechanism. Finally, the main trends of the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records are strongly correlated with the known evolution of the ISM, and therefore these records reflect the history of the ISM rather than that of the EASM. Our findings support the conclusion that EASM variability is mainly controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and was strongly modulated by ice volume during the last deglaciation and early Holocene, which delayed the response of the EASM maximum to peak insolation forcing.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Indeed, the Danube River and tributaries may themselves be responsible for the transportation of large volumes of silt that ultimately drive loess formation in the middle and lower reaches of this large catchment. However, this vast loess province lacks a unified stratigraphic scheme. European loess research started in the late 17th century in the Danube Basin with the work of Count Luigi Ferdinand Marsigli. Since that time numerous investigations provided the basis for the pioneering stratigraphic framework proposed initially by Kukla (1970, 1977) in his correlations of loess with deep-sea sediments. Loess\u2013palaeosol sequences in the middle and lower reaches of the Danube River basin were a key part of this framework and contain some of the longest and most complete continental climate records in Europe, covering more than the last million years. However, the very size of the Danube loess belt and the large number of countries it covers presents a major limiting factor in developing a unified approach that enables continental scale analysis of the deposits. Local loess\u2013palaeosol stratigraphic schemes have been defined separately in different countries and the difficulties in correlating such schemes, which often change significantly with advances in age-dating, have limited the number of basin-wide studies. A unified basin-wide stratigraphic model would greatly alleviate these difficulties and facilitate research into the wider significance of these loess records. Therefore we review the existing stratigraphic schemes and define a new Danube Basin wide loess stratigraphy based around a synthetic type section of the Mo\u0161orin and Stari Slankamen sites in Serbia. We present a detailed comparison with the sedimentological and palaeoclimatic records preserved in sediments of the Chinese Loess Plateau, with the oxygen isotope records from deep-sea sediments, and with classic European Pleistocene stratigraphic subdivisions. The hierarchy of Danubian stratigraphic units is determined by climatically controlled environmental shifts, in a similar way to the Chinese loess stratigraphic scheme. A new unified Danube loess stratigraphic model has a number of advantages, including preventing confusion resulting from the use of multiple national schemes, a more transparent basis, and the potential to set Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental changes recorded in the Danube catchment area into a global context. The use of a very simple labelling system based on the well-established Chinese loess scheme facilitates interpretation of palaeoenvironmental information reported from the Danube Basin loess sites in a wider more accessible context that can be readily correlated world-wide. This stratigraphic approach also provides, for the first time, an appropriate framework for the development of an integrated, pan-European and potentially pan-Eurasian loess stratigraphic scheme.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study synthesizes existing clay mineralogical and geochemical data from ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1500 samples from the seafloor and surrounding rivers, deepwater mooring observation results, and high-resolution glacial-cyclic clay mineralogy records from six high-quality sediment cores. Source-to-sink sediment transport from the river mouth to the continental shelf and then to the abyssal basin is investigated at two time scales: modern process and Late Quaternary glacial cycles. The results firstly show the high diversity of clay mineralogical and geochemical compositions in riverbed surface sediments surrounding the South China Sea, e.g., dominant illite and chlorite in Taiwan, overwhelming majority of smectite in Luzon, dominant kaolinite in South China, and similar amounts of the four clay mineral species in Red and Mekong river systems. The formation of these fluvial sediments through chemical weathering in surrounding drainage systems is controlled principally by the East Asian monsoon climate with warm temperature and high precipitation, and subordinately by tectonic activity and specific lithological character. The basin-wide distribution of clay mineral assemblages combined with neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions reflects strong provenance control and differential settling effects. The differential settling of kaolinite in slightly saline and proximal regions relative to smectite in more saline and distal regions is well demonstrated in the South China Sea. Through combining clay mineralogical distributions on the seafloor with observed oceanic current systems, the modern transport pathways can be well established, e.g., in the northern South China Sea, illite and chlorite from Taiwan are mainly carried by contour currents with the strong influence of mesoscale eddies.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">High-resolution sediment dynamic analysis for the Late Quaternary reveals different sediment transport patterns in the northern, western, and southern South China Sea when the land-sea configuration dramatically changed during glacial conditions. In the north, the terrigenous dispersal is mainly controlled by provenance supply and oceanic current transport. In the west, the clay mineral assemblage reflects variations of the prevailing surface current influenced by monsoon winds. In the south, the clay mineral input indicates intensive chemical weathering during interglacial periods and strengthened physical erosion during glacial periods. The transport of terrigenous sediments since the last glaciation is quantitatively reconstructed through studying two deepwater sediment cores located in the northern South China Sea. The relative contributions from three provenances (South China, Luzon, and Taiwan) highlight their distinct variability over the last 28<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, implying that the southward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at 16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP caused an increased sediment contribution from South China, the intensified influence of the Kuroshio Current intrusion controls more efficient westward transport of Luzon sediments, and the stronger deepwater current transports Taiwan-sourced sediments further westward from the last glaciation to the Holocene.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The North China Craton (NCC) represents a natural laboratory to evaluate early Precambrian crustal evolution. The tectonic framework of the NCC is composed of two major crustal blocks, the Western Block (WB) and the Eastern Block (EB). The northwestern margin of the EB preserves voluminous metamorphosed supracrustal basaltic to andesitic rocks of ca. 2522\u20132640<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma in the Fuxin greenstone belt within the Western Liaoning Province (WLP). These were intruded by the magmatic precursors of ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2495\u20132521<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma granitoid gneisses, which were generally metamorphosed under ca. 2485<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma regional metamorphism up to granulite facies, followed by ca. 2401\u20132450<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma amphibolite facies retrogression. Geochemically, the metamorphosed volcanic rocks can be subdivided into five groups with affinities to MORBs, island arc tholeiites (IATs), calc-alkaline basalts (CABs), high-magnesium andesites (HMAs), and adakites. The petrogenesis and temporal\u2013spatial distribution of these metamorphosed volcanic rocks and the intrusive granitoid gneisses in the WLP indicate that this basement terrane probably evolved as an intra-oceanic arc system, with major crustal growth at ca. 2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga. These rocks record complex crust\u2013mantle evolution history as follows. Partial melting of the depleted to slightly enriched asthenospheric mantle at a spreading ridge occurred at ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2600\u20132640<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma, generating both MORB-like rocks and juvenile oceanic lithospheric mantle sources. The mantle sources were gradually metasomatized by slab-derived fluids and melts during ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2506\u20132550<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma, and the partial melting of both the metasomatized lithospheric mantle and the descending oceanic slabs generated IATs, CABs, HMAs, and adakites (as well as tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite (TTG) gneisses of the high-magnesium group). Meanwhile, the coeval underplating of mantle-derived materials triggered the partial melting of the arc-root materials, yielding TTG gneisses of the low-magnesium group. Finally, the accretion of the intra-oceanic arc terrane to the ancient nucleus of the EB at ca. 2490<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ma resulted in the regional granulite-facies metamorphism and crustal anatexis (resulting in the formation of potassium-rich granitoid rocks), possibly related to asthenospheric upwelling.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">Based on a comprehensive analysis of the basement terranes in the EB, we propose that a late Neoarchean (~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) intra-oceanic arc system with relict MORB-like basaltic rocks bordering the northwestern margin of the continental nucleus (ca. 2.7\u20133.8<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) was established, extending from northern Liaoning Province, through western Liaoning Province, the Zunhua\u2013Qinglong block of eastern Hebei Province, northern Hebei Province, and the Huai\u2019an\u2013Xuanhua complexes of northwestern Hebei Province, up to the Wutai complex. To the northwest of the proposed \u201cWutai\u2013Zunhua\u2013Majuanzi\u201d boundary, the intra-oceanic arc system is characterized by the lack of ancient crystalline basement (\u2265<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga), and late Neoarchean metamorphosed basaltic rocks showing geochemical affinities to MORBs\u2013IATs\u2013CABs represent the oldest rocks yet identified.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0015\" view=\"all\">Accordingly, the development of both plume-related komatiites and metamorphosed arc-related calc-alkaline volcanic rocks as well as granitoid gneisses within the interior of the EB to the east suggest early Neoarchean (ca. 2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) plume\u2013craton and plume\u2013arc interactions as the major crust\u2013mantle geodynamic processes. In contrast, late Neoarchean (ca. 2.5\u20132.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>Ga) slab\u2013wedge interaction and arc\u2013continent accretion processes are compatible with the intra-oceanic arc system as well as the asymmetric distribution of the basement rocks.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Therefore, at the glacial\u2013interglacial scale, warmer summer and cooler winter conditions in interglacial periods are crucial to trigger peat deposition, whereas reduced evaporation in glacial period instead of decreased monsoonal-driven precipitation would have played a predominant role in the regional effective moisture balance. However, within the Holocene (MIS 1), monsoonal precipitation changes appear to be the main controller on millennial-scale variations of water-table level of the Dajiuhu peatland.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This low carbonate% event occurred at a time when the regional sea level rose from\u00a0\u221250\u00a0m to\u00a0\u221210\u00a0m, which drowned large areas of continental shelves especially those near and within the Taiwan Strait. This event is associated with a significant increase in bulk sedimentation rates on the upper continental slope and the relative abundance of fine-grained detritus. Sediment provenance analyses suggest a dominant terrigenous input from Taiwan and a minor contribution from Luzon during the low carbonate% event, similar to the background terrigenous deposition in other periods of the Holocene. Two comparable low carbonate% events, respectively from the beginning of marine isotope stages 5.5 and 7.3, have also been recognized, pointing to similar causal factors. While carbonate dissolution and carbonate accumulation rate should not have been responsible, increased terrigenous input and dilution is considered as the main cause for the recurrent low carbonate% events in early interglacials. We further hypothesize that, during early interglacials, fluvial sediment discharge from Taiwan and Luzon intensified due to stronger typhoon activities, and massive fine-grained sediments from these two end members may have been transported to the northern SCS continental slope via surface and deep ocean currents.

(1) El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation variability, while the most important global-scale mode of interannual climate variation, is insufficient to explain most of the variation of tropical South American climate observed in both the instrumental and the paleoclimate records. (2) Significant climate variation in tropical South America occurs on seasonal to orbital (i.e. multi-millennial) time scales as a result of sea-surface temperature (SST) variation and ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions of the tropical Atlantic. (3) Decadal-scale climate variability, linked with this tropical Atlantic variability, has been a persistent characteristic of climate in tropical South America for at least the past half millennium, and likely, far beyond. (4) Centennial-to-millennial climate events in tropical South America were of longer duration and, perhaps, larger amplitude than any observed in the instrumental period, which is little more than a century long in tropical South America. These were superimposed upon both precession-paced insolation changes that caused significant variation in SASM precipitation and eccentricity-paced global glacial boundary conditions that caused significant changes in the tropical South American moisture balance. As a result, river sediment and water discharge increased and decreased across tropical South America, lake levels rose and fell, paleolakes arose and disappeared on the Altiplano, glaciers waxed and waned in the tropical Andes, and the tropical rainforest underwent significant changes in composition and extent.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">To further evaluate climate forcing over the last glacial cycle (\u223c125\u00a0ka), we developed a climate forcing model that combines summer insolation forcing and a proxy for North Atlantic SST forcing to reconstruct long-term precipitation variation in the SASM domain. The success of this model reinforces our confidence in assigning causation to observed reconstructions of precipitation. In addition, we propose a critical correction for speleothem stable oxygen isotopic ratios, which are among the most significant of paleoclimate proxies in tropical South America for reconstruction of variation of paleo-precipitation (or SASM intensity). However, it is already well known that any particular \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O value observed in speleothem carbonate is affected by two processes that have nothing to do with changes in precipitation amount\u2014the influence of temperature on carbonate-water isotopic fractionation in the cave and the influence of changing \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O of seawater. Quantitatively accounting for both \u201cartifacts\u201d can significantly alter the interpretations of speleothem records. In tropical South America, both adjustments act in the same direction and have the tendency to increase the true amplitude of the paleo-hydrologic signal (but by different amounts in glacial and inter-glacial stages). These corrections have even graver implications for the interpretation of tropical Northern Hemisphere speleothem records (e.g. Chinese speleothems) where the combined adjustments tend to decrease or even eliminate the \u201ctrue\u201d signal amplitude.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The robust chronology of the presented record is based on varve counting and AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant macro-remains. In addition to the qualitative interpretation of the pollen data, we provide quantitative reconstructions of vegetation and climate based on the method of biomization and weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) technique, respectively. Power spectra were computed to investigate the frequency domain distribution of proxy signals and potential natural periodicities. Pollen assemblages, pollen-derived biome scores and climate variables as well as the cyclicity pattern indicate that NE China experienced significant changes in temperature and moisture conditions during the Holocene. Within the earliest phase of the Holocene, a large-scale reorganization of vegetation occurred, reflecting the reconstructed shift towards higher temperatures and precipitation values and the initial Holocene strengthening and northward expansion of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Afterwards, summer temperatures remain at a high level, whereas the reconstructed precipitation shows an increasing trend until approximately 4000\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP. Since 3500\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP, temperature and precipitation values decline, indicating moderate cooling and weakening of the EASM. A distinct periodicity of 550\u2013600 years and evidence of a Mid\u2013Holocene transition from a temperature-triggered to a predominantly moisture-triggered climate regime are derived from the power spectra analysis. The results obtained from SHL are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records from NE China, substantiating the regional nature of the reconstructed vegetation and climate patterns. However, the reconstructed climate changes contrast with the moisture evolution recorded in S China and the mid-latitude (semi-)arid regions of N China. Whereas a clear insolation-related trend of monsoon intensity over the Holocene is lacking from the SHL record, variations in the coupled atmosphere-Pacific Ocean system can largely explain the reconstructed changes in NE China.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Three sub-regions of fold-and-thrust belt are the Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range, Kohat Plateau\u2013Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin\u2013Khisor Range. The difference in deformation intensity between these regions is mainly attributed to the presence, or absence, of an Infra-Cambrian salt layer. This study investigates the active tectonics of the Potwar Plateau and Salt Range region, emphasizing the role of salt, using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometry (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. Ten PALSAR images and four seismic profiles from western Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range region were used. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range is active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of around 10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>mm/year. Two uplift anomalies were observed, which were interpreted as zones of transpression and salt diapirism. Time-migrated seismic profiles show that the salt layer acts as a detachment. Our results show that salt has different roles in different regions of the fold-and-thrust belt; in the Potwar Plateau region the salt layer acts as a detachment, while in Salt Range salt flow-induced structures are prominent. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation reveals that the deformation of western Potwar Plateau\u2013Salt Range is influenced by two main faults, the dextral Kalabagh fault and the Main Frontal Thrust. Finally, this work was compared to the Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt in western China due to their structural similarities.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, such estimation depends critically on an established relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground level PMs. In this study we performed an experiment at Xi'an to establish a relation between AOD and PM10. A first test of satellite AOD and PM10 data showed a low correlation between the two properties, especially in spring and summer seasons with relatively many high AOD values paired to low ground-level PM10 values, which hinted that AOD may \u2018contaminate\u2019 by summer agricultural burning season and dust storm intrusion leading to much elevated aerosol. MODIS fire count and CALIPSO vertical feature mask data were used to detect fire emissions and elevated aerosol to substantiate this hypothesis. A later test showed that the correlation between AOD and PM10 has strongly been improved by excluding the paired AOD-PM10 data with known biomass burning and elevated aerosol layers. This result indicates that summer agricultural burning and aloft aerosol should be considered when the AOD\u2013PM10 association is explored. Finally, a geographically weighted regression model was developed to further improve estimation of ground-level concentration by combining AOD with meteorological parameters.

During the sampling period, gaseous oxidized Hg and particulate bound Hg were 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 and 180\u2009\u00b1\u2009110\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 in winter and 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 and 130\u2009\u00b1\u2009100\u2009pg\u2009m\u22123 in spring, respectively. The relatively high mean concentration of TGM was mainly caused by regional anthropogenic emissions and occasional long-range transport from domestic source regions. Seasonal variation in the TGM concentration was observed with lower values in the wet monsoon season (from May to September) and higher values in the dry monsoon season (from October to April). Backward trajectories and potential source contribution function analysis suggested that anthropogenic Hg emission from coal combustion in the Yangtze River Delta region was the most likely cause for the elevated TGM concentrations. Relatively clean air originating from the East China Sea was the most possible cause for the observed low TGM concentrations. Positive correlation between TGM concentration and air quality index suggests that emissions that influenced regional air quality contributed to the elevated TGM concentrations.\n",

The extreme rainfall event of July 21, 2012, in Beijing was simulated for three representative urban land-use distributions (no urbanization, early urbanization level of 1980, and recent urbanization level of 2009). Results suggest that urban modification of rainfall is potentially sensitive to urban land-use condition. Rainfall was increased significantly over the downwind Beijing metropolis because of the effects of early urbanization; however, recent conditions of high urban development caused no significant increase. Further comparative analysis revealed that positive urban thermo-dynamical effects (i.e., urban warming, increased sensible heat transportation, and enhanced convergence and vertical motions) play major roles in urban modification of rainfall during the early urbanization stage. However, after cities expand to a certain extent (i.e., urban agglomeration), the regional moisture depression induced by the prevalence of impervious urban land has an effect on atmospheric instability energy, which might negate the city's positive impact on regional rainfall. Additional results from regional climate simulations for 10 Julys confirm this supposition. Given the explosive urban population growth and increasing demand for freshwater in cities, the potential negative effects of the urban environment on precipitation are worth investigation, particularly in rapidly developing countries and regions.\n",

However, the understanding of drought mechanism and predictability is limited. Based on the hindcasts from multiple climate models, the predictability and forecast skill for drought over China are investigated. The 3\u2009month standardized precipitation index is used as the drought index, and the predictability is quantified by using a perfect model assumption. Ensemble hindcasts from multiple climate models are assessed individually, and the grand multimodel ensemble is also evaluated. Drought forecast skill for model ensemble mean is higher than individual ensemble members, and North American Multimodel Ensemble grand ensemble performs the best. Predictability is higher than forecast skill, indicating the room for improving drought forecast. Drought predictability and forecast skill are positively correlated in general, but they vary depending on seasons, regions, and forecast leads. Higher drought predictability and forecast skill are found over regimes where ENSO has significant impact. For the ENSO-affected regimes, both drought predictability and forecast skill in ENSO years are higher than that in neutral years. This study suggests that predictability not only provides a measure for selecting climate models for ensemble drought forecast in ENSO-affected regimes but also serves as an indicator for forecast skill especially when in situ and/or remote sensing measurements for the hindcast verifications are considered unreliable.\n",

The WRF model was driven by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with the Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics component (GFDL-ESM2G) output over China at the resolution of 30\u2009km for the present day (1976\u20132005) and near future (2031\u20132050) under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. The results demonstrate that with improved resolution and better representation of finer-scale physical process, dynamical downscaling adds value to the regional precipitation simulation. WRF downscaling generally simulates more reliable spatial distributions of total precipitation and extreme precipitation in China with higher spatial pattern correlations and closer magnitude. It is able to successfully eliminate the artificial precipitation maximum area simulated by GFDL-ESM2G over the west of the Sichuan Basin, along the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in both summer and winter. Besides, the regional annual cycle and frequencies of precipitation intensity are also well depicted by WRF. In the future projections, under the RCP4.5 scenario, both models project that summer precipitation over most parts of China will increase, especially in western and northern China, and that precipitation over some southern regions is projected to decrease. The projected increase of future extreme precipitation makes great contributions to the total precipitation increase. In southern regions, the projected larger extreme precipitation amounts accompanied with fewer extreme precipitation frequencies suggest that future daily extreme precipitation intensity is likely to increase in these regions.\n",

It is found that the variation of the DFI exhibits long-range correlation. The long-range correlation gradually decreases from northwest to southeast over the studied region. Moreover, the recurrence times of droughts or floods also show long-range correlation. The long-range correlation in the DFI data will disappear if the DFI data are randomly shuffled, which was also found in the recurrence time of the randomly shuffled DFI series for each station. The results show that long-range correlation is an intrinsic property of drought or flood events, which could result in the long-range correlation of the corresponding recurrence times. At present, the prediction skill of droughts/floods in Asian-Australian monsoon region is relatively low, particularly in most of China. The long-range correlation of the DFI provides a theoretical basis for climate predictions of droughts/floods and may help improve model performance by amending the model configuration, in terms of addressing parameterization problems and improving atmosphere\u2013ocean coupling.\n",

In the variational scheme, a cost function is defined to measure the distance between analyzed precipitation field and observed rainfall quantity. A recursive filter is incorporated into the cost function which helps spread the observations to nearby grid points. Then a quasi-Newton method is used to solve the optimal estimation problem by minimizing the cost function. The adjoint technique is used to derive the gradient of cost function with respect to analysis precipitation. A series of experiments are performed to inter-compare the variational analysis with the original CMORPH satellite products (CMP) and the bias-adjusted satellite products (Adj-CMP) against the observations. The best overall performance is from the variational analysis especially rainfall intensity by more than 10 mm hr-1 with a prevailing mean relative spatial bias nearly reduction zero and the correlation coefficient is almost around 0.5 in convection active areas. Ground Cross Validation experiments in which each affected station is withdrawal at once indicated that the variatoinal analysis can particularly be beneficial and subsequent investigation of heavy rainfall events. It also reveals that the precipitation analysis field has the ability to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation and capture the spatial precipitation pattern agreements in relatively data-sparse regions.\n",

        "description": "\nAmong different winter precipitation types, freezing rain is the most dangerous and the most difficult to forecast. Nearly 84% of total freezing rain days in China occur over Guizhou province. Statistical analysis indicates that the frequency distribution of freezing rain over Guizhou is correlated to its topography. In this article, a typical freezing rain case from 2011 is selected to explore the impact of Guizhou topography on the distribution of freezing rain.\nSynoptic analysis shows that this event is dominated by two cold currents below 800 hPa and a warm, moist southwesterly at 700 hPa, which contribute to an overlaying surface cold layer and a warm layer aloft in central Guizhou. Freezing rain is developed through a \u2018warm rain process\u2019 under the mid\u2013lower tropospheric warm layer. Contrasting numerical terrain experiments demonstrate that Guizhou terrain plays an essential role in the formation of freezing rain by influencing the set-up of the surface cold layer, warm layer and precipitation. Except for the effect of altitude, the vertical distance between the cold centre in the cold flow and the surface height also impacts on the formation of the surface cold layer. The intensities of the warm layer and inversion change after altering terrain height. The number of rainwater particles reaching the surface layer decreases as the surface temperature increases in the lowered terrain experiment, whereas the block of steeper windward slope results in an increase of surface precipitation in the heightened terrain experiment. The regions experiencing freezing rain shrink after reducing the terrain but spread southeastwards after raising the terrain. The unique topography of Guizhou including its elevation and distribution contributes to the highest frequency of freezing rain in China.\n",

However, the relative contributions and plausible driving\nforces of the monsoon variability at different timescales remain\ncontroversial. Here, we spectrally explore time series of loess grain size\nand speleothem \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O records and decompose the two proxies into\nintrinsic components using the empirical mode decomposition method. Spectral\nresults of these two proxies display clear glacial and orbital periodicities\ncorresponding to ice volume and solar cycles, and evident millennial signals\nwhich are in pace with Heinrich rhythm and Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger (DO) cycles.\nFive intrinsic components are parsed out from loess grain size and six\nintrinsic components from speleothem \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O records. Combined signals\nare correlated further with possible driving factors including the ice\nvolume, insolation and North Atlantic cooling from a linear point of view.\nThe relative contributions of components differ significantly between loess\ngrain size and speleothem \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O records. Coexistence of glacial and\norbital components in the loess grain size implies that both ice volume and\ninsolation have distinctive impacts on the winter monsoon variability, in\ncontrast to the predominant precessional impact on the speleothem\n\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O variability. Moreover, the millennial components are evident\nin loess grain size and speleothem \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O records with variances of\n13 and 17 %, respectively. A comparison of the millennial-scale signals\nof these two proxies reveals that abrupt changes in the winter and summer\nmonsoons over the last 260 kyr share common features and similar driving\nforces linked to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere climate.",

        "description": "\n\nThe observed summertime drying over Northern Central India (NCI) during the latter half of the 20th century is not reproduced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble average. At the same time, the spread between precipitation trends from individual model realizations is large, indicating that internal variability potentially plays an important role in explaining the observed trend. Here we show that the drying is indeed related to the observed 1950-1999 positive trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and that the relationship is even stronger for a simpler index (S1). Adjusting the CMIP5 simulated precipitation trends to account for the difference between the observed and simulated S1 trend increases the original multi-model average NCI drying trend from \u22120.09\u00b10.31 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 to \u22120.51\u00b10.40 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 . Thus, our estimate of the 1950-1999 NCI drying associated with Pacific decadal variability is of similar magnitude as our previous CMIP5 based estimate of the drying due to anthropogenic aerosol. The drying (moistening) associated with increasing (decreasing) S1 can partially be attributed to a southeastward (northwestward) shift of the boundary between ascent and descent affecting NCI. This shift of the ascent region strongly affects NCI, butnot Southeast Asia and south China. The average spread between individual model realizations is only slightly reduced when adjusting for S1 as smaller scale variability also plays an important role.\n",

The South Asian monsoonal region in this study is referred to as a broad area that includes the Arabian Sea, the Indian peninsula, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indochina peninsula. The precipitation exhibits a significant enhancement in May, compared to that in the previous month. The present results indicate that the interannual variability of May precipitation in this region is significantly regulated by two independent factors: The Europe-West Asia (EWA) teleconnection and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. The EWA teleconnection pattern is characterized by the see-saw pattern of upper-tropospheric geopotential height anomalies between the Europe and the Iranian plateau. Both the factors modulate the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature and lower-tropospheric zonal winds, and thus affect the rainfall in the monsoonal region. Therefore, both the extratropical circulation teleconnection and tropical forcing are crucial for inducing rainfall variability in May over the monsoonal region.\n",

Zhang, B. Yu, X. Wang, C.-J. Lin, and X. B. Feng<br /><br />China presently contributes the largest amount of anthropogenic mercury (Hg)\nemission into the atmosphere in the world. Over the past decade, numerous\nstudies have been conducted to characterize the concentration and forms of\natmospheric Hg in China, which provide insights into the spatial and temporal\ndistributions of atmospheric Hg through ground-based measurements at widely\ndiverse geographical locations and during cruise and flight campaigns. In\nthis paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state of understanding\nin atmospheric Hg in China. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and\nparticulate-bound mercury (PBM) measured at the remote sites in China are\nsubstantially elevated compared to the background values in the Northern\nHemisphere. In Chinese urban areas, the highly elevated GEM, PBM and gaseous\noxidized mercury (GOM) were mainly derived from local anthropogenic Hg\nemissions, whereas regional anthropogenic emissions and long-range transport\nfrom domestic source regions are the primary causes of the elevated GEM and\nPBM concentrations at remote sites. Using 7\u20139 years of continuous\nobservations at a remote site and an urban site, a slight increase in\natmospheric GEM (2.4\u20132.5 % yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was identified (paired samples\ntest: <i>p</i> < 0.01), which is in agreement with the increasing\ndomestic anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic GEM emission quantity in\nChina estimated through the observed GEM / CO concentration ratios ranged\nfrom 632 to 1138 t annually over the past decade, 2\u20133 times larger than\npublished values using emission activity data. Modeling results and filed\nmeasurements show dry deposition is the predominant process for removing Hg\nfrom the atmosphere, 2.5\u20139.0 times larger than wet deposition, due to the\nelevated atmospheric GEM and PBM concentrations that facilitate dry\ndeposition to terrestrial landscapes. Further studies to reconcile the\nobserved and simulated Hg concentrations, to understand the impact of\ndomestic emission reduction on Hg concentration and deposition and to\ndelineate the role of Hg emission and deposition of China in the global Hg\nbiogeochemical cycle, are needed.",

Ding, R. J. van der A, B. Mijling, P. F. Levelt, and N. Hao<br /><br />The Nanjing Government applied temporary environmental regulations to\nguarantee good air quality during the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2014. We\nstudy the effect of those regulations by applying the emission estimate\nalgorithm DECSO (Daily Emission estimates Constrained by Satellite\nObservations) to measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We\nimproved DECSO by updating the chemical transport model CHIMERE from v2006 to\nv2013 and by adding an Observation minus Forecast (OmF) criterion to filter\noutlying satellite retrievals due to high aerosol concentrations. The\ncomparison of model results with both ground and satellite observations\nindicates that CHIMERE v2013 is better performing than CHIMERE v2006. After\nfiltering the satellite observations with high aerosol loads that were\nleading to large OmF values, unrealistic jumps in the emission estimates are\nremoved. Despite the cloudy conditions during the YOG we could still see a\ndecrease of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> column concentrations of about 32 % in\nthe OMI observations when compared to the average NO<sub>2</sub> columns from 2005 to\n2012. The results of the improved DECSO algorithm for NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions show\na reduction of at least 25 % during the YOG period and afterwards. This\nindicates that air quality regulations taken by the local government have an\neffect in reducing NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. The algorithm is also able to detect\nan emission reduction of 10 % during the Chinese Spring Festival. This\nstudy demonstrates the capacity of the DECSO algorithm to capture the change\nof NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions on a monthly scale. We also show that the observed\nNO<sub>2</sub> columns and the derived emissions show different patterns that\nprovide complimentary information. For example, the Nanjing smog episode in\nDecember 2013 led to a strong increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations without an\nincrease in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. Furthermore, DECSO gives us important\ninformation on the non-trivial seasonal relation between NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions\nand NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on a local scale.",

S. Weng, D. H. Yan, H. Wang, J. H. Liu, Z. Y. Yang, T. L. Qin, and J. Yin<br /><br />Drought is firstly a resource issue, and with its development it evolves\ninto a disaster issue. Drought events usually occur in a determinate but a\nrandom manner. Drought has become one of the major factors to affect\nsustainable socioeconomic development. In this paper, we propose the\ngeneralized drought assessment index (GDAI) based on water resources systems\nfor assessing drought events. The GDAI considers water supply and water\ndemand using a distributed hydrological model. We demonstrate the use of the\nproposed index in the Dongliao River basin in northeastern China. The\nresults simulated by the GDAI are compared to observed drought disaster\nrecords in the Dongliao River basin. In addition, the temporal distribution of\ndrought events and the spatial distribution of drought frequency from the\nGDAI are compared with the traditional approaches in general (i.e., standard\nprecipitation index, Palmer drought severity index and rate of water deficit\nindex). Then, generalized drought times, generalized drought duration, and\ngeneralized drought severity were calculated by theory of runs. Application\nof said runs at various drought levels (i.e., mild drought, moderate drought,\nsevere drought, and extreme drought) during the period 1960\u20132010 shows that\nthe centers of gravity of them all distribute in the middle reaches of\nDongliao River basin, and change with time.

        "description": "\n\nBiomass burning from the Indo-China Peninsula region is an important source of atmospheric mercury (Hg). We isolated eighteen unique transport events over 2 years using observations of Hg and CO at a high-altitude background site in southwestern China (Mt. Ailao Observatory Station) to assess the transport and impact of Hg emissions from biomass burning. The quantity of Hg emission and the source regions were determined using \u0394TGM/\u0394CO slopes coupled with backward trajectory analysis and CO emission inventories. The slopes of \u0394TGM/\u0394CO appeared to be a useful chemical indicator for source identification. Industrial emission sources exhibited slopes in the range of 5.1-61.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 (pptv/pptv), in contrast to a slope of 2.0-6.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 for typical biomass burning. Transboundary transport of Hg from biomass burning led to episodically elevated atmospheric Hg concentrations during springtime. Hg emissions from biomass burning in the Indo-China Peninsula region from 2001 to 2008 were estimated to be 11.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1Mg yr\u22121, equivalent to 40% of annual anthropogenic emissions in the region. In addition, Hg emissions from biomass burning contained a substantial fraction of PBM. Assuming that PBM readily deposits locally (within 50 km), the local Hg deposition caused by the PBM was estimated to be 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 Mg yr\u22121, up to 1 order of magnitude higher than the PBM deposition caused by anthropogenic emissions during springtime in the region. The strong springtime emissions potentially pose a threat to the ecosystems of the Indo-China Peninsula and southwest China.\n",

Streamflow (Q) is an important indicator of hydrological processes that represents the combined effects of climatic and land surface conditions. Here 14 catchments located in the LP were chosen to explore the Q response to different driving factors during the period 1961\u20132009 by using elasticity and decomposition methods based on the Budyko framework. Our results show that (1) annual Q exhibited a decreasing trend in all catchments (\u22120.30 \u223c \u22121.71 mm yr\u22122), with an average reduction of \u22120.87 mm yr\u22122. The runoff coefficients in flood season and nonflood season were both decreasing between two periods divided by the changing point in annual Q series; (2) the precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (E0) elasticity of Q are 2.75 and \u22121.75, respectively, indicating that Q is more sensitive to changes in P than that in E0; (3) the two methods consistently demonstrated that, on average, ER (62%) contributing to Q reduction was much larger than that of climate change (38%). In addition, parameter n that entails catchment characteristics in the Budyko framework showed positive correlation with the relative area of ER measures in all catchments (eight of them are statistically significant with p\u2009<\u20090.05). These findings highlight the importance of ER measures on modifying the hydrological partitioning in the region. However, ER actions over the sloping parts of the landscape weakened the impact of those in channels (i.e., check-dams) on Q, especially after the implementation of the Grain-for-Green project in 1999.\n",

Based on comparison with AE estimates calculated using the Budyko equation, all five reanalysis data sets reasonably reproduce the spatial patterns of AE over China, with a clearly southeast-northwest gradient. Overall, JRA-55 (NCEP-DOE) gives the lowest (highest) reanalysis evaporation (RE) values. From 1979 to 2013, dominant modes of RE among five reanalyses are extracted using multivariate empirical orthogonal function analysis. Accordingly, the interdecadal variation of RE is likely driven by the change of temperature, and the interannual variation is constrained by the water supply conditions. Under climate warming, RE increase in the Northwest China, Yangtze-Huaihe river basin, and South China, while they decrease in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and northern and Northeast China. Moreover, the relationship between RE and pan evaporation (PE) are comprehensively evaluated in space-time. Negative correlations are generally confirmed in nonhumid environments, while positive correlations exist in the humid regions. Our analysis supports the interpretation that the relationship between PE and AE was complementary with water control and proportional with energy control. In view of data availability, important differences in spatial variability and the amount of RE can be found in Northwest China, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the Yangtze River Basin. Generally speaking, NCEP-NCAR and MERRA have substantial problems on describing the long-term change of RE; however, there are some inaccuracies in the JRA-55 estimates when focusing on the year-to-year variation.\n",

Olsson, S. Ye, X. Yu, M. Wei, K. W. Krauss, and H. Brix<br /><br />Many factors are known to influence greenhouse gas emissions from coastal\nwetlands, but it is still unclear which factors are most important under\nfield conditions when they are all acting simultaneously. The objective of\nthis study was to assess the effects of water table, salinity, soil\ntemperature and vegetation on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and ecosystem respiration\n(<i>R</i><sub>eco</sub>) from five coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China:\ntwo <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed) wetlands, two <i>Suaeda salsa</i> (sea blite) marshes and a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) paddy.\nThroughout the growing season, the <i>Suaeda</i> wetlands were net CH<sub>4</sub> sinks whereas\nthe <i>Phragmites</i> wetlands and the rice paddy were net CH<sub>4</sub> sources emitting 1.2\u20136.1 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>\u22122</sup> yr<sup>\u22121</sup>.\nThe <i>Phragmites</i> wetlands emitted the most CH<sub>4</sub> per\nunit area and the most CH<sub>4</sub> relative to CO<sub>2</sub>. The main controlling\nfactors for the CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were water table, temperature, soil\norganic carbon and salinity. The CH<sub>4</sub> emission was accelerated at high\nand constant (or managed) water tables and decreased at water tables below\nthe soil surface. High temperatures enhanced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, and\nemission rates were consistently low (< 1 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>&minus;1</sup>) at soil temperatures < 18 \u00b0C. At salinity levels\n> 18 ppt, the CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates were always low (< 1 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>&minus;1</sup>) probably because methanogens were\nout-competed by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Saline <i>Phragmites</i> wetlands can, however,\nemit significant amounts of CH<sub>4</sub> as CH<sub>4</sub> produced in deep soil\nlayers are transported through the air-space tissue of the plants to the\natmosphere. The CH<sub>4</sub> emission from coastal wetlands can be reduced by\ncreating fluctuating water tables, including water tables below the soil\nsurface, as well as by occasional flooding by high-salinity water. The\neffects of water management schemes on the biological communities in the\nwetlands must, however, be carefully studied prior to the management in\norder to avoid undesirable effects on the wetland communities.",

Considering the effects of surface characteristics and air condition on the surface temperature, using 1\u2009km data from the MOD02 thermal infrared bands of the EOS/moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on satellite Aqua, other MODIS products and temperatures observed from weather stations at 14:00\u2009China standard time (CST), the study analyzes the relationships between dTsa and brightness temperature in the infrared atmospheric window band (Bt31 and Bt32), the water vapor band (Bt28), the atmospheric temperature band (Bt25), and the CO2 band (Bt34). A model estimating dTsa is built. The model coefficients are estimated for 96 stations representing 96 sets of surface and atmospheric conditions, and 71 sets of coefficients among them passing 90% confidence levels of estimating dTsa are selected as references. Combined with the probabilistic neural network (PNN) method and nine parameters reflecting surface characteristics in one season and month, the Tibetan Plateau surface is classified as 71 types with 71 sets of coefficients. PNN is certified an efficient classification method for multiple parameters and mass data. Based on PNN and estimated model, estimated dTsa shows 1.36\u00b0C root-mean-square error and a standard deviation of 0.74\u00b0C, and dTsa distribution exhibits all centers with peak value and valley value of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, MYD07, and simple regression model results, showing its superiority. The model is worthy of further exploration and application in an effort to advance the retrieval of surface energy fluxes from remote sensing.\n",

The sensitivities of short- and medium-range simulations to the LSSs systematically varied with the lead times. In general, the model reproduced short-range, high-temperature distributions. The simulated weather was sensitive to the LSSs, and the LSS-induced sensitivity was higher in the medium range than in the short range. Furthermore, the LSS performances were complex, i.e., the PX errors apparently increased in the medium range (longer than 6 days), RUC produced the maximum errors, and SLAB and NOAH had approximately equivalent errors that slightly increased. Additional sensitivity simulations revealed that the WRF modeling system assigns relatively low initial soil moisture for RUC and that soil moisture initialization plays an important role that is comparable to the LSS choice in the simulations. LSS-induced negative feedback between surface air temperature (SAT) and atmospheric circulation in the lower atmosphere was found in the medium range. These sensitivities were mainly caused by the LSS-induced differences in surface sensible heat flux and by errors associated with the lead times. Using the SAT equation, further diagnostic analyses revealed LSS deficiencies in simulating surface fluxes and physical processes that modify the SAT and indicated the main reasons for these deficiencies. These results have implications for model improvement and application. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Shen, J. Wang, X. Cheng, Y. Rui, and S. Ye<br /><br />The rapid progress of lidar\ntechnology has made the acquirement and application of high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data increasingly popular, especially in regards to\nthe study of floodplain flow. However, high-resolution DEM data pose several\ndisadvantages for floodplain modeling studies; e.g., the data sets contain\nmany redundant interpolation points, large numbers of calculations are\nrequired to work with data, and the data do not match the size of the\ncomputational mesh. Two-dimensional (2-D) hydraulic modeling, which is a\npopular method for analyzing floodplain flow, offers highly precise\nelevation parameterization for computational mesh while ignoring much of the\nmicro-topographic information of the DEM data itself. We offer a flood\nsimulation method that integrates 2-D hydraulic model results and\nhigh-resolution DEM data, thus enabling the calculation of flood water\nlevels in DEM grid cells through local inverse distance-weighted\ninterpolation. To get rid of the false inundation areas during\ninterpolation, it employs the run-length encoding method to mark the\ninundated DEM grid cells and determine the real inundation areas through the\nrun-length boundary tracing technique, which solves the complicated problem\nof connectivity between DEM grid cells. We constructed a 2-D hydraulic model\nfor the Gongshuangcha detention basin, which is a flood storage area of\nDongting Lake in China, by using our integrated method to simulate the\nfloodplain flow. The results demonstrate that this method can solve DEM\nassociated problems efficiently and simulate flooding processes with greater\naccuracy than simulations only with DEM.",

Continuous stochastic variables are approximated by scenario trees. This paper evaluates the impact of scenario tree reduction on model performance for hydropower operations and suggests procedures to determine the optimal level of scenario tree reduction. We first establish a stochastic programming model for the optimal operation of a cascaded system of reservoirs for hydropower production. We then use the neural gas method to generate scenario trees and employ a Monte Carlo method to systematically reduce the scenario trees. We conduct in-sample and out-of-sample tests to evaluate the impact of scenario tree reduction on the objective function of the hydropower optimization model. We then apply a statistical hypothesis test to determine the significance of the impact due to scenario tree reduction. We develop a stochastic programming with recourse model and apply it to real-time operation for hydropower production to determine the loss in solution accuracy due to scenario tree reduction. We apply the proposed methodology to the Qingjiang cascade system of reservoirs in China. The results show: (1) the neural gas method preserves the mean value of the original streamflow series but introduces bias to variance, cross variance, and lag-one covariance due to information loss when the original tree is systematically reduced; (2) reducing the scenario number by as much as 40% results in insignificant change in the objective function and solution quality, but significantly reduces computational demand.\n",

Yu<br /><br />In China, a rapid increase in passenger vehicles has led to the growing\nconcern of vehicle exhaust as an important source of anthropogenic secondary\norganic aerosol (SOA) in megacities hard hit by haze. In this study, the SOA\nformation of emissions from two idling light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs)\n(Euro 1 and Euro 4) operated in China was investigated in a 30 m<sup>3</sup> smog\nchamber. Five photo-oxidation experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C\nwith relative humidity at around 50 %. After aging at an OH exposure of\n5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>\u22123</sup> h, the formed SOA was 12\u2013259\ntimes as high as primary organic aerosol (POA). The SOA production factors\n(PF) were 0.001\u20130.044 g kg<sup>\u22121</sup> fuel, comparable with those from the\nprevious studies at comparable OH exposure. This quite lower OH exposure than\nthat in typical atmospheric conditions might however lead to the\nunderestimation of the SOA formation potential from LDGVs. Effective SOA\nyields in this study were well fit by a one-product gas-particle partitioning\nmodel but quite lower than those of a previous study investigating SOA\nformation from three idling passenger vehicles (Euro 2\u20134). Traditional\nsingle-ring aromatic precursors and naphthalene could explain 51\u201390 % of\nthe formed SOA. Unspeciated species such as branched and cyclic alkanes might\nbe the possible precursors for the unexplained SOA. A high-resolution\ntime-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer was used to characterize the\nchemical composition of SOA. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>43</sub> (ratio of\n<i>m/z</i> 43, mostly C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, to the total signal in mass spectrum)\nand <i>f</i><sub>44</sub> (mostly CO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) of the gasoline vehicle exhaust SOA is\nsimilar to the ambient semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA).

Results show that the model does not simulate a prolonged period of negative IPO before A.D. 1300 suggested by the proxy reconstruction, although it does simulate centennial periods of negative and positive IPO. The simulated IPO exhibits several low-frequency oscillations, including 10\u201323, 30\u201333, 35\u201370, and 85\u2013110\u2009years. However, it remains an open question whether simulated IPO oscillations longer than bidecadal mode can be or not be considered as essentially internal modes of variability. The simulations indicate that precipitation over eastern China is associated with the IPO. When the strongest IPO signal of 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation occurs, the summer precipitation goes of opposite sign over North China (NC) and the middle and lower Yangtze River Vally (MLYRV), i.e., dipole mode such as the \u201cflood-in-south and drought-in-north\u201d pattern that occurs during the positive IPO episodes and vice versa. While coherent mode is dominant when the relatively weak IPO signal occurs, and warm phases of the IPO coincide with coherent drought and vice versa. The association between 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation of the IPO and precipitation in NC is more marked than that in the MLYRV. Our results suggest that the internal variability of climate system like the IPO may play an important role in precipitation over eastern China, at least on the 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation.",

The calculated CBL height sequence displays the regular diurnal cycle of the CBL top. The prevalent mixing process within the CBL is also revealed. During the CBL growth period, the backscatter ratio R falls visibly with increasing altitude and has large variance within the CBL, suggesting that more abundant aerosol particles from lower altitudes are being transported upward and being mixed with the local background or advected aerosol layers. During the CBL quasistationary period, R tends to be vertically uniform, and its variance reaches a daytime minimum within the CBL, indicating that the vertical homogenization of aerosol particles produced by the convectively driven mixing reaches its maximum. During the afternoon and early evening transition period, the vertical uniformity of R weakens and the variance enlarges again, implying that the reduced convectively driven mixing fails to maintain a high vertical homogeneity. When the 1\u2009min R profiles were plotted together in terms of each 1\u2009h interval, the fluctuating R curves at heights around the CBL top looked like a \u201cnode\u201d, representing the structure of the entrainment zone between the CBL and the free troposphere. The moving node depicts the evolution of the entrainment zone. The diurnal variation of the CBL height shows an obvious seasonal dependence which coincides with the annual variation of the local surface temperature. The surface fine particle concentration generally has a more complex diurnal cycle than that expected from the CBL-dilution/CBL-accumulation effect. But, it shows a strong annual variation which is out of phase with respect to that of the monthly mean maximum CBL height. This tends to suggest that the seasonal behavior of the surface fine particle concentration mainly depends on the seasonal variation in available volume (determined by the CBL height) for aerosol dispersion.",

Li, Y. Wang, W. J. Li, J. M. Chen, T. Wang, and W. X. Wang<br /><br />The\nconcentrations and solubility of twelve trace elements in PM<sub>2.5</sub> at Mt.\nLushan, southern China, were investigated during the summer of 2011 and the\nspring of 2012. The average PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass was\n55.2 \u00b1 20.1 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123</sup> during the observation period.\nTemporal variations of all trace elements including total and water-soluble\nfractions with several dust storm spikes in total fractions of Al and Fe were\nobserved. The enrichment factor (EF) values were 1 order of magnitude higher\nfor the water-soluble fractions versus the total fractions of trace elements.\nFour major emission sources, namely nonferrous metal mining and smelting (for\nCr, As, Ba and parts of Zn), coal combustion (for Pb, Zn, Se, Cu and Mn),\ncrustal materials (for Al and Fe) and municipal solid waste incineration (for\nCd and Mo), were classified by principal component analysis (PCA). Trajectory\ncluster analysis and the potential source contribution function (PSCF)\nconsistently identified the Yangtze River delta (YRD), the Pearl River delta\n(PRD), and the neighbouring  provinces\nof Mt. Lushan as the major source regions and transport pathways for\nanthropogenic elements. Northern China was identified as a major source\nregion for crustal elements. It should be noted that apart from the YRD, the\narea around Mt. Lushan has become the most significant contributor to the\nsolubility of most trace elements. Element solubility can be partially\ndetermined by emission sources. However, enhanced solubility of trace\nelements corresponding to increased concentrations of\nsulfate  after the occurrence of cloud\nevents indicated significant effects of cloud processing on aerosol element\ndissolution. Metal particles mixed with sulfate in cloud droplet residues\nwere further investigated through transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nanalysis. Irreversible alteration of particle morphology by cloud processing\nwas confirmed to be highly responsible for the enhancement of trace element\nsolubility. The findings from this study imply an important role of regional\nanthropogenic pollution and cloud processing in the evolution of aerosol\ntrace element solubility during transport in the troposphere.",

Chu, C. Zhang, G. Fu, Y. Li, and H. Zhou<br /><br />This study investigates the effectiveness of a sensitivity-informed method\nfor multi-objective operation of reservoir systems, which uses global\nsensitivity analysis as a screening tool to reduce computational\ndemands. Sobol's method is used to screen insensitive decision\nvariables and guide the formulation of the optimization problems with a\nsignificantly reduced number of decision variables. This\nsensitivity-informed method dramatically reduces the computational demands\nrequired for attaining high-quality approximations of optimal trade-off\nrelationships between conflicting design objectives. The search results\nobtained from the reduced complexity multi-objective reservoir operation\nproblems are then used to pre-condition the full search of the original\noptimization problem. In two case studies, the Dahuofang reservoir and the\ninter-basin multi-reservoir system in Liaoning province, China, sensitivity\nanalysis results show that reservoir performance is strongly controlled by a\nsmall proportion of decision variables. Sensitivity-informed dimension\nreduction and pre-conditioning are evaluated in their ability to improve the\nefficiency and effectiveness of multi-objective evolutionary optimization.\nOverall, this study illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nsensitivity-informed method and the use of global sensitivity analysis to\ninform dimension reduction of optimization problems when solving complex\nmulti-objective reservoir operation problems.",

Zhu, T. Wang, J. Bieser, and V. Matthias<br /><br />The contribution from different emission sources and atmospheric processes\nto gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM),\nparticulate bound mercury (PBM) and mercury deposition in eastern China were\nquantified using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ-Hg) modeling\nsystem run with a nested domain. Natural sources (NAT) and six categories of\nanthropogenic mercury sources (ANTH) including cement production (CEM),\ndomestic life (DOM), industrial boilers (IND), metal production (MET),\ncoal-fired power plants (PP) and traffic (TRA) were considered for source\napportionment. NAT were responsible for 36.6 % of annual averaged GEM\nconcentration, which was regarded as the most important source for GEM in\nspite of obvious seasonal variation. Among ANTH, the influence of MET and PP\non GEM were most evident especially in winter. ANTH dominated the variations\nof GOM and PBM concentrations with   contributions of 86.7  and 79.1 %,\nrespectively. Among ANTH, IND were the largest contributor for GOM (57.5 %)\nand PBM (34.4 %) so that most mercury deposition came from IND. The effect\nof mercury emitted from out of China was indicated by a > 30 %\ncontribution to GEM concentration and wet deposition. The contributions from\nnine processes \u2013 consisting of emissions (EMIS), gas-phase chemical\nproduction/loss (CHEM), horizontal advection (HADV), vertical advection\n(ZADV), horizontal advection (HDIF), vertical diffusion (VDIF), dry\ndeposition (DDEP), cloud processes (CLDS) and aerosol processes (AERO) \u2013 were\ncalculated for process  analysis with their comparison in urban and\nnon-urban regions of the Yangtze River delta (YRD). EMIS and VDIF affected\nsurface GEM and PBM concentrations most and tended to compensate each other\nall the time in both urban and non-urban areas. However, DDEP was the most\nimportant removal process for GOM with 7.3  and 2.9 ng m<sup>\u22123</sup>\nreduced in the surface of urban and non-urban areas, respectively, in 1\nday. The diurnal profile variation of processes revealed the transportation of\nGOM from urban area to non-urban areas and the importance of CHEM/AERO in\nhigher altitudes which partly caused diffusion of GOM downwards to non-urban areas. Most of the anthropogenic mercury was transported and diffused away from\nurban areas by HADV and VDIF and increased mercury concentrations in non-urban\nareas by HADV. Natural emissions only influenced CHEM and AERO more\nsignificantly than anthropogenic. Local emissions in the YRD contributed\n8.5 % more to GEM and ~ 30 % more to GOM and PBM in urban\nareas compared to non-urban areas.",

        "description": "\nClimate change has largely been understood as a biophysical, economic, and political phenomenon. This approach has obscured the ways in which climate change also poses a challenge to human subjective understandings of self and society in relation to place, and in relation to perceptions of the sacred. Glaciers, as dominant features of high mountain landscapes, are sites of easily observable consequences of climate change, grounding the consequences of distant carbon emissions in material surroundings. They are also sites of powerful sacred and symbolic meanings for local communities. This review examines three instances of glacial decline in sacred mountain landscapes, in the Peruvian Andes, the Nepalese Himalaya, and the Meili Snow Mountains of Yunnan, China. These examples show that glacial decline is not simply a material process, but also has important implications for the ways that local people understand themselves and make meaning in relation to their surroundings. Locally grounded values arising from particular experiences of the landscape, especially from those most at risk from effects of climate change, may offer new avenues of ethical reflection around climate change that can and should influence larger climate discourses.

The Hexi Corridor, which is a typical arid and semiarid region in Northwest China, was selected as the study area. Streamflows were simulated by an integrated water system model in a historical period (1985\u20132005) and three future periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s). Twenty-nine global climate models were picked from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 based on projection performance, and the high (RCP85) and intermediate (RCP45) ranges of Representative Concentration Pathways were selected for future scenario analysis. All the streamflows were characterized in detail by flow regime metrics, including the magnitude, variability, and frequency of the overall flow events. The regional impacts of climate change were assessed and clustered into several similar spatial patterns. Results showed that the projected climate change would sensibly increase the magnitudes of average and low flows (75th percentile), as well as the frequencies of low and high flows (25th percentile), but decrease the flow variability. By contrast, it would not sensibly change the magnitude of high-flow events. The flow regime variations of all scenarios and periods were clustered into three robust classes (highly, moderately, and slightly impacted classes) in the entire region. The flow regimes would be highly and moderately impacted in the middle stream and downstream with large-sized and semidesert catchments but slightly impacted in the upper and middle streams with small-sized and montane vegetation catchments. The impacted classes will sensibly vary at most stations in different future periods because of the spatial differences of climate change. This study would provide scientific support to implement the integrated adaptive water resource management for climate change at regional scales in the arid Hexi Corridor.",

The coastal mean annual amplitude of the seasonal cycle varies between zero and 24 cm, reaching a maximum between July and January. The maximum mean semiannual amplitude is 7 cm, peaking between March and June. Along the coast, the seasonal cycle accounts for up to 92% of the mean monthly sea level variability. Atmospheric pressure explains a significant portion of the seasonal cycle with dominant annual signals in the northern SCS, the Gulf of Thailand and the north-western Philippines Sea. The wind forcing is dominant on the shelf areas of the SCS and the Gulf of Thailand where a simple barotropic model forced by the local wind shows annual amplitudes of up to 27 cm. In the deep basin of the SCS, the Philippines Sea and the shallow Malacca Strait, the steric component is the major contributor with the maximum annual amplitudes reaching 15 cm. Significant variability in the seasonal cycle is found on a year-to-year basis. The annual and semiannual amplitudes vary by up to 63% and 45% of the maximum values, 15 cm and 11 cm, respectively. On average, stepwise regression analysis of contribution of different forcing factors accounts for 66% of the temporal variability of the annual cycle. The zonal wind was found to exert considerable influence in the Malacca Strait.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe variability of the intermediate water (IW) east of Luzon and Taiwan is investigated using data acquired from moored instrumented lines and shipboard hydrographic and current velocity surveys. The IW is defined as the water mass with a local salinity minimum along the Kuroshio path. An empirical formula is developed to estimate the IW salinity minimum east of Taiwan using temperature measurements around 580 m depth. Properties of the IW east of Taiwan vary greatly as a result of variable contributions from three water masses including the high-salinity South China Sea Intermediate Water (SCSIW), the low-salinity North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), and the intermediate-salinity Kuroshio Intermediate Water (KIW). Our analysis concludes that NPIW is predominantly found east of Taiwan, and the northward transport of KIW from northeast of Luzon to east of Taiwan is not a steady process. Concurrent mooring measurements at these two locations enable us to correlate the variations of the layer thickness of the Kuroshio near its origin (KLTo) northeast of Luzon to the nature of the IW east of Taiwan. When the Kuroshio is deep, i.e., large KLTo, KIW is transported northward across the Luzon Strait, where its salinity increases presumably due to turbulence mixing with SCSIW. This modified KIW is then transported to the east of Taiwan. When the Kuroshio is shallow, i.e., small KLTo, the KIW transport east of Luzon is nil or southward. East of Taiwan, NPIW feeds in below the Kuroshio and is transported northward beyond the I-Lan Ridge.\n",

Like precipitation rate, precipitation frequency is dominated by warm rain, defined as rain produced via the liquid phase only, over the tropical oceans outside the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by cold rain, produced via the ice phase, over the midlatitude oceans and continents. Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.\n",

We divided all precipitation events into four non-overlapping categories: light, moderate, heavy and very heavy based on percentile thresholds. We then established the trends for annual total and precipitation of different intensity categories, and examined their regional and seasonal variations. The results show that there was little change in annual total precipitation for entire China, but distinctive regional patterns existed. In general, precipitation increased in the west and decreased in east. Precipitation of different intensities, in general, changed in the same direction as the mean, but heavy and very heavy precipitation events had higher rates of change than mean precipitation. The exception was the southeast region, where despite the slight decrease in mean precipitation, heavy and very heavy precipitation still increased significantly. In addition, we used multiple regression models to explore the contribution of changes of frequency and intensity to total precipitation change, and the contributions of changes of precipitation at different intensities to total precipitation change. For western China, total precipitation change was associated more with frequency change, whereas in eastern China intensity contributed more. For precipitation amount, moderate, heavy and very heavy precipitations contributed to the total change, with little contribution from light precipitation change. For frequency, changes in light and moderate precipitation frequencies dominated the total change, with very little contributions from heavy and very heavy precipitation frequency changes. In addition, we examined the linkage between summer precipitation in eastern China and the East-Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), found that the northern decrease and southern increase in summer precipitation was likely caused by the weakening of EASM over the study period.\n",

The probability density function of May\u2013August rainfall in southern China is skewed towards large values in phases 2\u20134 of the first component and in phases 5\u20137 of the second component of BSISO life cycle, during which the probability of extreme rainfall events at the 75th (90th) percentile increases by 30\u201350% (over 60%) relative to the non-BSISO period. The devastating floods with prolonged extreme rainfall in southern China over the three past decades occurred coincidently with these BSISO phases. The first component of BSISO, associated with 30\u201360-day eastward/northeastward-propagating ISO, is more favourable for the rainfall extreme over in-land China. In contrast, the second component of BSISO, related to the 10\u201330-day northwestward propagating ISO, tends to link with the rainfall extreme along the southeast coast of South China. Moisture budget indicates that the favourable environment for rainfall extreme is associated with southwesterly moisture convergence over southern China, while the moisture advection contributes insignificantly. This study suggests a potential for monitoring and probabilistic prediction of extreme rainfall events in southern China based on the real-time BSISO indices.\n",

        "description": "\n\nUnderstanding how hydrological extremes would respond to global warming and its associated uncertainties is important for better designing mitigation and adaption strategies to cope with global change. Very few works have investigated the changes in future hydrological extremes and, especially, the more devastating joint hydrological extremes over China. In this article, two combinations of joint extremes [i.e. high runoff/high soil moisture (HRHS) and low runoff/low soil moisture (LRLS)] are designed for analysis. To derive the scenarios of hydrological conditions, the bias-corrected daily climate projections from five global circulation models (GCMs) under the historical and Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenarios are used to drive the calibrated Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model from 1951 to 2099 over China. Results show notable increase of occurrence of HRHS in Northeast China, LRLS in Northwest and South of China under 2\u2009\u00b0C global warming. The spatial pattern of changes in joint extremes tends to remain stable with global temperature increase up to 3\u2009\u00b0C. Compared with the individual extreme risk, joint extreme are much more concentrated in Northwest and South China and the magnitude of changes is several times larger. Larger areas experiencing changes are found when using lower standards of extreme definition. Because hydrological regime may change gradually in response to climate change, the threshold derived from present regime may lead to misrepresentation of extreme risk analysis. This was demonstrated by the ten times smaller magnitude of changes when adopting the updated transient threshold representing the changing hydrological regime, thus providing a low-boundary of potential changes in extremes. Our results highlight the importance of considering the changing hydrological regime in addition to choosing various levels of threshold for extreme definition in order to cover the full range of possible extreme changes in a warming climate.\n",

Recent studies found a discernible impact of anthropogenic forcing on this extreme heat wave event. In this study, we investigate the role of multidecadal variability (MDV) in regulating the likelihood of the 2013 heat wave event. Using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, we decomposed the heat wave index series into three components: (1) a non-linear secular trend (ST), representing the long-term anthropogenic warming; (2) MDV; and (3) the residual high-frequency variability. For the period 1873\u20132013, the linear trend of heat wave strength (HW-S, defined as the July\u2013August mean temperatures) was 0.06\u2009\u00b0C per decade, mainly because of the contribution of ST. MDV plays an important role in regulating changes over decades. ST and MDV together form a changing climate background (CB) for extreme events. The 2013 heat wave event would be almost impossible under the pre-industrial CB but becomes likely under the long-term warming background, with a return period of longer than 103\u2009years. When the positive phase of MDV is added to the secular warming background (the current CB), the return period of a super-heat wave such as the 2013 event becomes about 42 (12\u2013103) years. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) shows significant correlation with the MDV component of the HW-S in Shanghai. The correlation pattern between the AMO and MDV of July\u2013August temperatures over the Northern Hemisphere is analysed to explain the AMO\u2013Shanghai relationship. It is suggested that the likelihood of such an extreme event will increase with further long-term climate warming, modified by low-frequency oceanic variations such as the AMO.\n",

Cui, P. Mao, Y. Zhao, C. P. Nielsen, and J. Zhang<br /><br />China is experiencing severe carbonaceous aerosol pollution driven mainly by\nlarge emissions resulting from intensive use of solid fuels. To gain a\nbetter understanding of the levels and trends of carbonaceous aerosol\nemissions and the resulting ambient concentrations at the national scale, we\nupdate an emission inventory of anthropogenic organic carbon (OC) and\nelemental carbon (EC) and employ existing observational studies to analyze\ncharacteristics of these aerosols including temporal, spatial, and size\ndistributions, and the levels and shares of secondary organic carbon (SOC)\nin total OC. We further use ground observations to test the levels and\ninter-annual trends of the calculated national and provincial emissions of\ncarbonaceous aerosols, and propose possible improvements in emission\nestimation for the future. The national OC emissions are estimated to have\nincreased 29 % from 2000 (2127 Gg) to 2012 (2749 Gg) and EC by 37 %\n(from 1356 to 1857 Gg). The residential, industrial, and transportation\nsectors contributed an estimated 74\u201378, 17\u201321, and 4\u20136 % of the\ntotal emissions of OC, respectively, and 49\u201355, 30\u201334, and 14\u201318 %\nof EC. Updated emission factors (EFs) based on the most recent local field\nmeasurements, particularly for biofuel stoves, led to considerably lower\nemissions of OC compared to previous inventories. Compiling observational\ndata across the country, higher concentrations of OC and EC are found in\nnorthern and inland cities, while higher OC / EC ratios are found in southern\nsites, due to the joint effects of primary emissions and meteorology.\nHigher OC / EC ratios are estimated at rural and remote sites compared to\nurban ones, attributed to more emissions of OC from biofuel use, more\nbiogenic emissions of volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors to SOC,\nand/or transport of aged aerosols. For most sites, higher concentrations of\nOC, EC, and SOC are observed in colder seasons, while SOC / OC is reduced,\nparticularly at rural and remote sites, attributed partly to weaker\natmospheric oxidation and SOC formation compared to summer. Enhanced SOC\nformation from oxidization and anthropogenic activities like biomass\ncombustion is judged to have crucial effects on severe haze events\ncharacterized by high particle concentrations. Several observational studies\nindicate an increasing trend in ambient OC / EC (but not in OC or EC\nindividually) from 2000 to 2010, confirming increased atmospheric oxidation\nof OC across the country. Combining the results of emission estimation and\nobservations, the improvement over prior emission inventories is indicated\nby inter-annual comparisons and correlation analysis. It is also indicated,\nhowever, that the estimated growth in emissions might be faster than\nobserved growth, and that some sources with high primary OC / EC, such as burning\nof biomass, are still underestimated. Further studies to determine changing\nEFs over time in the residential sector and to compare to other\nmeasurements, such as satellite observations, are thus suggested to improve\nunderstanding of the levels and trends of primary carbonaceous aerosol\nemissions in China.",

Lei<br /><br />There have been few studies of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs,\ndespite the remarkable growth in the number of reservoirs in developing\ncountries. We report a case study that focuses on the littoral zone of a\nmajor Chinese reservoir, where we established measurements of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes\nusing the static chamber technique at five different water levels (deep\nwater, shallow water, seasonally flooded, control for seasonally flooded, and\nnon-flooded). The \"control for seasonal flooded\" had similar vegetation to\nthe \"seasonally flooded\" but was not actually flooded as it was on a higher\npiece of land. Seasonal, diurnal and spatial variations of N<sub>2</sub>O flux and\nenvironmental factors were monitored throughout the growing season which\nincluded a flood event during summer rains. The N<sub>2</sub>O flux ranged from\n\u2212136.6 to 381.8 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup> averaging\n6.8 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22122</sup> h<sup>\u22121</sup>. Seasonal and spatial variation was\nsignificant but diurnal variation was not. Non-flooded dry land emitted more\nN<sub>2</sub>O than flooded land, no matter whether it was permanently or\nseasonally flooded. Piecewise correlation was found between N<sub>2</sub>O flux,\nair temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Positive correlation was\nshown between N<sub>2</sub>O flux and dissolved oxygen in water. There were\nsignificantly higher emissions from farmland. We compared these results with\nour recently published study of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, carried out\nsimultaneously at the same site as those in the present study. Completely\ndifferent patterns between the two gases are demonstrated. We conclude that\nthe littoral zone is a hotspot for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the summer,\nespecially when the shores of the lake are used for the farming of maize. But\nin terms of the overall greenhouse gas budget, the fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O are not\nas important as those of CH<sub>4</sub>.",

Luc\u00eda, F. Comiti, M. Borga, M. Cavalli, and L. Marchi<br /><br />Understanding and modelling the dynamics of large wood (LW) in rivers during\nflood events has spurred a great deal of research in recent years. However,\nfew studies have documented the effect of high-magnitude flash floods on LW\nrecruitment, transport and deposition. On 25 October 2011, the Magra river\nbasin (north-western Italy) was hit by an intense rainstorm, with hourly\nrainfall rates up to 130 mm h<sup>\u22121</sup> and event rain accumulations up to\n540 mm in 8 h. Such large rainfall intensities originated flash floods in\nthe main river channels and in several tributaries, causing severe damages\nand loss of lives. Numerous bridges were partly or fully clogged by LW jams.\nA post-flood survey was carried out along the channels of two catchments that\nwere severely and similarly affected by this event, the Gravegnola\n(34.3 km<sup>2</sup>) and Pogliaschina (25.1 km<sup>2</sup>). The analysis highlighted\na very relevant channel widening in many channel reaches, which was more\nmarked in the Gravegnola basin due to highly erodible material forming the\nslopes adjacent to the fluvial corridor. Large wood recruitment rates were very\nhigh, up to 1270 m<sup>3</sup> km<sup>\u22121</sup>, and most of it (70\u201380 %) was\neroded from the floodplains as a consequence of channel-widening processes,\nwhile the rest came from hillslopes processes. Overall, drainage area and\nchannel slope are the most relevant controlling variables in explaining the\nreach-scale variability of LW recruitment, whereas LW deposition appears to\nbe more complex, as correlation analysis did not evidence any statistically\nsignificant relationship with the tested controlling variables. Indeed,\nin-channel LW displacement during the flood has been mostly limited by the\npresence of bridges, given the relatively large width attained by channels\nafter the event.",

Tao, J. Liu, G. A. Ban-Weiss, D. A. Hauglustaine, L. Zhang, Q. Zhang, Y. Cheng, Y. Yu, and S. Tao<br /><br />Rapid urbanization throughout eastern China is\nimposing an irreversible effect on local climate and air quality. In this\npaper, we examine the response of a range of meteorological and air quality\nindicators to urbanization. Our study uses the Weather Research and\nForecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF/Chem) to simulate the climate\nand air quality impacts of four hypothetical urbanization scenarios with\nfixed surface pollutant emissions during the month of July from 2008 to 2012.\nAn improved integrated process rate (IPR) analysis scheme is implemented in\nWRF/Chem to investigate the mechanisms behind the forcing\u2013response\nrelationship at the process level. For all years, as urban land area expands,\nconcentrations of CO, elemental carbon (EC), and particulate matter with\naerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) tend to decrease near\nthe surface (below ~ 500 m), but increase at higher altitudes\n(1\u20133 km), resulting in a reduced vertical concentration gradient. On the\nother hand, the O<sub>3</sub> burden, averaged over all newly urbanized grid cells,\nconsistently increases from the surface to a height of about 4 km.\nSensitivity tests show that the responses of pollutant concentrations to the\nspatial extent of urbanization are nearly linear near the surface, but\nnonlinear at higher altitudes. Over eastern China, each 10 % increase in\nnearby urban land coverage on average leads to a decrease of approximately\n2 % in surface concentrations for CO, EC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while for\nO<sub>3</sub> an increase of about 1 % is simulated. At 800 hPa, pollutants'\nconcentrations tend to increase even more rapidly with\nan increase in nearby urban land coverage. This\nindicates that as large tracts of new urban land emerge, the influence of\nurban expansion on meteorology and air pollution would be significantly\namplified. IPR analysis reveals the contribution of individual atmospheric\nprocesses to pollutants' concentration changes. It indicates that, for\nprimary pollutants, the enhanced sink (source) caused by turbulent mixing and\nvertical advection in the lower (upper) atmosphere could be a key factor in\nchanges to simulated vertical profiles. The evolution of secondary pollutants\nis further influenced by the upward relocation of precursors that impact\ngas-phase chemistry for O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol processes for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Our\nstudy indicates that dense urbanization has a moderate dilution effect on\nsurface primary airborne contaminants, but may intensify severe haze and\nozone pollution if local emissions are not well controlled.",

This teleconnection pattern is characterized by a meridional dipole of anomalous circulation and precipitation between the tropical WNP and the midlatitudes. This study develops a long index of the PJ pattern using station-based atmospheric pressure data to track the PJ variability from 1897 to 2013. This index is correlated with a wide array of climate variables including air temperature, precipitation, Yangtze River flow, Japanese rice yield and the occurrence of tropical cyclones over the WNP (especially those that make landfall on the Chinese and Korean coast). For the recent three decades, the PJ index reproduces well-known correlations with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the preceding boreal winter and Indian Ocean temperature in the concurrent summer. For the 117-year period, this ENSO-PJ relationship varies on interdecadal time scales, with low correlations in the 1920s and from the 1940s to 1970s, and recurrences of significant correlations at the beginning of the 20th century and the 1930s. In accordance with the modulation, the magnitude and regional climate effect of the PJ variability have changed. These results highlight the importance of interdecadal modulations of climate anomalies in the summer WNP and the need of long-term observations to study such modulations.\n",

The model employed for dynamical downscaling is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), with a 12.5-km horizontal grid spacing in the domain. According to our results, the CYP for rice, one of the major crops presently cultivated in the area, is expected to decrease throughout most of the region, despite a projected expansion of both vegetable and crop periods. This is projected to occur particularly in South Korea, Japan, and Southeast and Northeast China. Such a change is related to the projected rise in temperature within these regions, which will exceed the grain-filling optimum temperature of rice. In contrast, the climate projection of the RCPs is that the CYP will increase over northeastern parts of the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far Eastern region (Primorsky), because temperatures in these regions are expected to rise and approach the grain-filling optimum temperature. For the RCPs, the optimum heading date, on which the domain averaged CYP is the highest, is expected to be later than that of the Historical by approximately 17\u201324 days. In addition, the maximum CYP in the RCPs is projected to decrease compared with that of the historical, and the possible period of rice ripening (period in which the CYP is greater than 0) is also expected to decrease.\n",

The water and land requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves but local shortages are common and have serious impacts on food security. Recent increases in global trade have mitigated some of the effects of spatial and temporal variability. However, trade has a limited impact on low-income populations who remain dependent on subsistence agriculture and local resources. Potential adverse environmental impacts of increased agricultural production include unsustainable depletion of water and soil resources, major changes in the global nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, human health problems related to excessive nutrient and pesticide use, and loss of habitats that contribute to agricultural productivity. Some typical case studies from China illustrate the connections between the need for increased food production and environmental stress. Sustainable options for decreasing food demand and for increasing production include reduction of food losses on both the producer and consumer ends, elimination of unsustainable practices such as prolonged groundwater overdraft, closing of yield gaps with controlled expansions of fertilizer application, increases in crop yield and pest resistance through advances in biotechnology, and moderate expansion of rain fed and irrigated cropland. Calculations based on reasonable assumptions suggest that such measures could meet the food needs of an increasing global population while protecting the environment.\n",

This process plays an important role in cross-shelf material exchange in the East China Sea (ECS), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study suggests that the penetrating fronts are the response of buoyant coastal water to along-isobath undulation of the ambient pycnocline that is controlled by the temperature stratification in seawater. When the ambient pycnocline descends sharply in the downshelf direction, coastal water is transported offshore due to the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief (JEBAR), and thus generates a penetrating front. Along-isobath pycnocline undulation in the ECS can arise from nonuniform tidal mixing due to tidal wave divergence off the Min-Zhe Coast. Onshelf intrusion of cold and dense Kuroshio subsurface water prevents thorough mixing of the pycnocline. Different from the common cross-shelf transport phenomena induced by winds or frontal instabilities, such a tidal mechanism should produce penetrating fronts at specific locations, in agreement with observations.\n",

Results show that GCMs reliably reproduce the geographical distribution of the variables considered. Compared with observations, however, most GCMs have topography-related cold biases (although these are smaller than those found in previous studies), excessive precipitation, an underestimated southeast\u2013northwest precipitation gradient, an overestimated magnitude and spatial variability of the interannual variability of temperature and precipitation, and an inadequate strength of the East Asian monsoon circulation. Pairwise comparison reveals that GCMs continue to improve from the TAR via the AR4 to the AR5 for temperature, but have little change for precipitation and the East Asian monsoon. The ability of GCMs varies with season and is affected to certain degree by their horizontal resolutions. Both the arithmetic mean and the median of multiple GCMs are little affected by filtering GCMs in terms of their ability, and the multi-model mean outperforms most of individual GCMs in every respect.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWith the purpose of further understanding the spatio-temporal changes in precipitation, temperature and their possibly changing relationship in the Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical arid and semi-arid region in China, the modified Mann\u2013Kendall (MMK) test method was used to capture their trends at monthly and annual time scales, and the K-means cluster analysis method was applied to divide the whole basin into three homogeneous sub-regions. Furthermore, a copulas-based method was introduced in this study to identify possible inflection points of the relationship between precipitation and temperature in the WRB. Results indicate that: (1) spatially, both annual average precipitation and temperature decreased from southeast to northwest; temporally, for most months, a decreasing trend was found for precipitation while the air temperature in most months has a significantly increasing trend at 99% confidence level at monthly and annual time scales in the WRB; (2) climate warming has less effect on the precipitation structure than that on the precipitation magnitude in the WRB; and (3) overall, the relationship between precipitation and temperature in the whole WRB has no significant inflection point, implying a relatively stable relationship between precipitation and temperature changes. This study provides a new idea and quantitative measure for the identification of inflection points of the relationship between precipitation and temperature.\n",

To gain a complete picture of AHEs in mainland China and to lay the groundwork for modelling of regional climate and the environment, AHEs from energy consumption and human metabolism were estimated, and an inventory was established with gridded distributions and profiles of temporal variations. This was based on the top\u2013down inventory approach by using officially published statistical data. Results indicated that total AHE of the mainland was 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091020\u2009J\u00b7a\u22121, of which industry, transportation, buildings and human metabolism contributed 73.0, 11.6, 10.6 and 4.8%, respectively. Coal and electricity accounted for approximately 74% of the total emissions from energy consumption. The annual average heat flux of the mainland was 0.4\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122, with a sharp difference between the eastern and western regions. Fluxes in the eastern regions were mostly between 0.5 and 20\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122, and they were between 0 and 0.05\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122 in the western regions. In urban or built-up areas of typical cities, the heat fluxes may be much higher than the average for larger areas, typically ranging from 20 to 100\u2009W\u00b7m\u22122. Region-specific profiles of temporal variations will improve the inventory in the future, which can be applied to climatic and environmental models to obtain in-depth knowledge of the effects of AHEs.\n",

In spring 2011, we examined the distribution of dissolved Al in the East China Sea (ECS) to assess the potential passage of coastal water across the shelf to the western Pacific. Measurement of dissolved Al in coastal, shelf, and shelf break waters indicated decreasing concentrations with distance from the coast. However, the northward increase of dissolved Al in the upper 100 m along the shelf break transect, corresponding to the northward flow of Kuroshio Water along the Okinawa Trough from the north of Taiwan to the Tokara strait, indicates contributions of terrestrial material. The presence of an Al plume indicated cross-shelf transport at the subsurface at a potential density of 23.3\u201324.0 kg/m3. This plume originates from the near-bottom layer along the coast off Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, and first moves southeastward (to the north of Taiwan) and then northeastward (to shelf break with export at 29\u00b0N, 127\u00b0E). We calculated the cross-shelf fluxes of water and dissolved Al based on simulation results of the 3-D Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). The calculated cross-shelf fluxes of Al at the subsurface layer indicate that the ECS is highly efficient in pumping Al-rich coastal waters northward to the Japan Sea/East Sea and/or eastward into the western Pacific. We also identified an important role of the monsoon, with a change from northeasterly wind to southwesterly wind in spring, on the cross-shelf transport of Al by use of numerical tracer experiments.\n",

We comprehensively evaluate the performance of five reanalysis datasets in reproducing the EASM precipitation. These datasets are NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project (NCEP1), NCEP-U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Model Intercomparison ProjectIIreanalysis (NCEP2), Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis Project (JRA-25), Interim ECMWF Re-analysis (ERA-Interim), and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). Results show that the five reanalysis datasets can generally reproduce the climatology and interannual variability of EASM precipitation. Especially, the MERRA and ERA-Interim have the highest skills. Considering different-class precipitation, large uncertainties exist in the category of non-rainfall and heavy rainfall. The five reanalysis datasets overestimate the non-rainfall frequency, and the JRA25 and NCEP2 overestimate the heavy rainfall frequency. The well-known inter-decadal variation around mid-1990s can also be better depicted by ERA-Interim and MERRA. For linear trend of precipitation, only the MERRA can reasonably reproduce the increasing tendency over southern China and western Pacific and the decreasing tendency over Indo-China Peninsula. Based on the EOF analysis, the spatial-temporal structure of EASM precipitation has been examined. The MERRA, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim can better capture both the spatial patterns and principle components of first two EOF modes. Based on our evaluation, the preferential reanalysis datasets for investigating the EASM precipitation are the ERA-Interim and MERRA, which also permit the more precise investigations of interannual to decadal variability.\n",

This article comprehensively presents temporal and spatial changes of these indices for the time period 1961\u20132010. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes consistent with warming, for instance, decreases in cold extremes and increases in warm extremes over China. The warming in the coldest day and night is larger than the warmest day and night, respectively, which is concurrent with the coldest night larger than the coldest day and the warmest night larger than the warmest day. Changes in the number of the cold and warm nights are more remarkable than the cold and warm days. Changes in precipitation extremes are, in general, spatially more complex and exhibit a less widespread spatial coverage than the temperature indices, for instance, the patterns of annual total precipitation amount, average daily precipitation rate, and the proportion of heavy precipitation in total annual precipitation are similar with negative trends in a southwest\u2013northeast belt from Southwest China to Northeast China while positive trends in eastern China and northwestern China. The consistency of changes in climate extremes from the CN05 with other datasets based on the stations and reanalyses is also analysed.\n",

This paper provides the first comprehensive global review of tropical storm surge data sources, observations, and impacts while archiving data in SURGEDAT, a global database. Available literature has provided data for more than 700 surge events since 1880, the majority of which are found in the western North Atlantic (WNA), followed by Australia/Oceania, the western North Pacific (WNP), and the northern Indian Ocean (NIO). The Bay of Bengal (BOB) in the NIO consistently observes the world's highest surges, as this subbasin averages five surges \u22655\u2009m per decade and has observed credible storm tide levels reaching 13.7\u2009m. The WNP observes the highest rate of low-magnitude surges, as the coast of China averages 54 surges \u22651\u2009m per decade, and rates are likely higher in the Philippines. The U.S. Gulf Coast observes the second highest frequency of both high-magnitude (\u22655\u2009m) and low-magnitude (\u22651\u2009m) surges. The BOB observes the most catastrophic surge impacts, as 59% of global tropical cyclones that have killed at least 5000 people occurred in this basin. The six deadliest cyclones in this region have each killed at least 140,000 people, and two events have killed 300,000. Storm surge impacts transportation, agriculture, and energy sectors in the WNA. Oceania experiences long-term impacts, including contamination of fresh water and loss of food supplies, although the highest surges in this region are lower than most other basins.\n",

The sensitivities to wind, surface pressure, and specific humidity are generally smaller. Moreover, the upper levels of the atmosphere are identified as the sensitive levels, and the sensitive areas are the areas with heavy rainfall. These results suggest that local temperature perturbations in the upper levels are a signal of short-term heavy rainfall in southwestern China. A validation experiment is carried out to justify the sensitivity results. The possible reasons are discussed and analyzed.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOver the Far East in summer, climate is strongly influenced by the fluctuating Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), and strong precipitation is often associated with southeasterly low-level wind that brings moist air from the southern China seas. The WPSH intra-seasonal variability is partly influenced by quasi-stationary wave-trains propagating eastwards from Europe across Asia along the two westerly jets: the Silk-Road wave-train along the Asian jet at mid-latitudes and the polar wave-train along the sub-polar jet. In the unusual summer of 2010, Northeast China experienced its worst seasonal flooding for a decade, triggered by unusually severe precipitation. That summer was also characterized by a record-breaking heat wave over Eastern Europe and Russia, whose impact on the precipitation further east over China has been little explored. Here, we examine the role of the Silk-Road and polar wave-trains, and their impact on precipitation over Northeast China throughout August 2010, using station precipitation data and re-analyses. We found that there is a strong link between the Silk-Road wave-train and extreme precipitation events, associated with a strong occasional influence of the polar wave-train.\nForecasting such regional precipitation events at the monthly timescale remains a big challenge for operational global prediction systems. In this study, we use simulations with the atmospheric model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at a horizontal resolution of T255 to highlight the key role of the intra-seasonal fluctuations of the Silk-Road and polar wave-trains in modulating extreme precipitation over North and Northeast China in August 2010. While the ensemble-mean of the forecasts fails to predict the pulses of the Silk-Road wave-train, some model members show a high spatial correlation in upper-level meridional winds with re-analyses. Similarly, there is high spatial correlation between model meridional winds and precipitation. These results highlight the importance of better representing the intra-seasonal evolution of the Silk-Road wave-train in order to improve the monthly prediction of summer precipitation over the Far East.\n",

Intercomparison results indicate good agreements among PWV products with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.775 to 0.937. As for spatial analysis, 13 years of MODIS MOD05 products were investigated and the spatial distribution of PWV is closely correlated with the topography, e.g. latitude and altitude, in mainland China. A monotonically increasing annual trend was detected in some radiosonde sites in China between 1976 and 1999, but a decreasing trend was observed between 2000 and 2012. Analysis of the differences in PWV between weekdays and weekends indicated a marked weekend effect, suggesting the influence of anthropogenic activities.

It was found that PAR increased at the rate of 0.54\u2009mol\u2009m\u22122 d\u22121\u2009 decade-1 since 1990 and the most evident increases were observed in summer (1.96\u2009mol\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121\u2009 decade-1). However, PAR decreased at the rate of -0.37\u2009mol\u2009m\u22122 d\u22121 \u2009 decade-1 in spring during 1990\u20132012.\n",

Peak flow, daily discharge, and precipitation data from 1969 to 2011 were examined. Trends were calculated using Sen's slope estimator. The statistical significance of the observed trends was checked with the Mann\u2013Kendall method. Change points were detected using the Pettitt test and moving T-test methods. The hydrological periodicity was revealed by wavelet transformation. The results showed that the changes in monthly and monthly maximum 1- and 5-day precipitation and discharges during the flood season showed very similar characteristics. They experienced positive (negative) trends mainly in June\u2013July (April, May, and August), and mostly did not experience significant change points. Compared with the period 1969\u20131990, monthly and monthly maximum 1(5)-day precipitation and discharges showed increasing (decreasing) trends, mainly in June\u2013July (April\u2013May) in 1991\u20132011. Overall, the changes in flood risk were mainly influenced by precipitation variability. However, human activity (including urbanization and the construction of reservoirs, soil and water conservation measures, and land use change, among others) have probably affected the flooding process in the study area. The decreases in peak flows during the late 1980s and early 1990s were probably caused by large-scale soil and water conservation measures. Construction of reservoirs in the past 20 years also played a role in the reduction of peak flows. The results of this study are of great scientific value to better understand the changing flood risk under the changing environment in the Beijiang River basin.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis paper focuses on testing appropriate methods to produce gridded rainfall surfaces based on the daily rainfall observed at 43 meteorological stations in the Sichuan Province during rainy seasons of 2008\u20132013. Rainfall is extremely variable in both spatial and temporal distribution. Therefore, three methods, namely Ordinary Kriging (OK), Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and ordinary CoKriging (CK), have been selected and examined. First, we choose a suitable model by adjusting relevant parameters including the power exponent, the Neighbours to Include and the Include at Least. Then, cross-validation is used to verify the prediction performance of the three methods. The results for spatial interpolation of daily rainfall show that: (1) both OK and CK methods recorded smaller mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error than IDW method. (2) A preferable combination of assigning 2 to power exponent, 15 to Neighbours to Include and 5 to Include at Least is identified for IDW method. As for the best combination of OK and CK methods, Neighbours to Include is assigned with 15 while Include at Least almost has no effect on their performance. (3) CK is the optimal method for spatial interpolation of the daily rainfall in the rainy season of Sichuan.\n",

        "description": "\n\nFive gridded datasets containing measures of temperature and precipitation extremes over the past five decades over China are compared. Time series, spatial averages and trends in China's coldest and warmest days and nights and wettest days are estimated from these datasets that vary in their station network density, interpolation procedures and the order in which extremes are calculated. We find that country-wide trends in temperature extremes are coherent irrespective of dataset choice although actual values are generally smaller in the dataset in which indices are calculated from daily interpolated grids rather than from station points. There are also some regional differences in trends especially over regions with sparse data networks, e.g. the Tibetan Plateau. Averaged across China, trends calculated over the period 1961\u20132009 vary from a minimum of 0.13\u2009\u00b0C\u2009decade\u22121 (hottest day) to 0.65\u2009\u00b0C\u2009decade\u22121 (coldest night). The coldest day and night have tended to warm faster than the warmest day and night. Trends in precipitation extremes are much less coherent spatially and can be positive or negative depending on the choice of dataset. The length of station record chosen is also vital to eliminate spurious trends. The results have important implications for detection and attribution and model evaluation studies.\n",

The results showed that large improvements of interpolation accuracy in daily surface maximum temperature were achieved in border areas by adding climate information from neighbouring countries. Mean absolute error (MAE) was reduced by an average of 0.6\u2009\u00b0C\u2009year\u22121 and the frequency distribution of daily bias narrowed and became more peaked at 21 boundary stations that were withheld from the model-building process. Although pronounced variation was not found in most part of mainland China at a 10\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009km grid resolution, the interpolated temperature transition between different thresholds became more stable and aligned with elevation gradients in western and northern border areas of China after incorporating data from the 162 foreign stations into the spatial interpolations. Therefore, caution should be taken when generating gridded data sets only based on observed sites in study areas to investigate regional climate change, particularly if border areas with complicated terrain are insufficiently covered by data networks.\n",

        "description": "\n\nDrought is one of the most devastating natural disasters occurring in the Yellow River basin (YRB) in Central and North China, with strong impacts on human societies and natural environments. Based on datasets from ECMWF/ERA-Interim on atmospheric circulation and sea level pressure and on rainfall data from meteorological networks from 1979 to 2013, droughts in the YRB are investigated in the present work. Rainfall in summer in the northern YRB (semi-arid and semi-humid zones) has been low since 1990, which is associated with an anomaly of planetary waves around Lake Baikal. These waves are significantly affected by Arctic ice loss (particularly in the eastern Arctic) among other factors. Eastern Arctic ice loss results in a warmer surface and increases air temperatures over the Arctic and northern Siberia. These conditions are favourable for cyclonic anomalies in the lower troposphere, generating an ascending flow anomaly over the eastern Arctic and a positive anomaly of meridional wind in the low troposphere between high latitudes and the Arctic. This situation results in a weaker Polar cell and a stronger Ferrel cell in the three-cell latitudinal circulation, due to increasing the ascending flow at approximately 60\u00b0N as well as the descending flow at approximately 35\u00b0\u201353\u00b0N. These conditions favour reinforcement as well as the width of subtropical high pressures, meridional shifts or northward elongation, the anomaly of planetary wave ridges around Lake Baikal, finally, more severe droughts in the northern YRB. Simulations performed with an atmospheric general circulation model confirm that Arctic sea ice loss can induce a northward shift and enhancement of subtropical high pressures, together with decreasing rainfall in the mid-latitudes of both North America and East Asia, especially in the northern YRB.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSurface greenness and rainfall in spring have changed from the 1980s to 1990s over the North China Plain (NCP). The greenness changes are characterized by large increase in north and little in south with an obvious greening zone from the centre of the NCP to the northeast. The rainfall change has a similar spatial pattern with reversed sign. The correlation between changes in greenness and rainfall is significant and the correlation (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.71, p\u2009<\u20090.001) is highest for light rainfall. The number of light rainfall days decreased by only \u223c10% at the stations where the Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) did not change, whereas it decreased by up to \u223c30% at the stations where NDVI increased by 20%. Further analyses found that surface greening increased evaporation wetting the atmosphere and, meanwhile, reduced sensible heat flux to cooling surface air. The cooling surface promotes the air stability and thus suppresses the occurrence of rainfall. This finding supports that surface cooling effects from greening play a more dominant role on occurrence of spring rainfall than the wetting effect in the NCP.\n",

        "description": "Rapid industrialization and urbanization in developing countries has led to an increase in air pollution, along a similar trajectory to that previously experienced by the developed nations. In China, particulate pollution is a serious environmental problem that is influencing air quality, regional and global climates, and human health. In response to the extremely severe and persistent haze pollution experienced by about 800 million people during the first quarter of 2013 (refs 4, 5), the Chinese State Council announced its aim to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0micrometres) by up to 25 per cent relative to 2012 levels by 2017 (ref. 6). Such efforts however require elucidation of the factors governing the abundance and composition of PM2.5, which remain poorly constrained in China. Here we combine a comprehensive set of novel and state-of-the-art offline analytical approaches and statistical techniques to investigate the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi\u2019an during January 2013. We find that the severe haze pollution event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation, which contributed 30\u201377 per cent and 44\u201371 per cent (average for all four cities) of PM2.5 and of organic aerosol, respectively. On average, the contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) are found to be of similar importance (SOA/SIA ratios range from 0.6 to 1.4). Our results suggest that, in addition to mitigating primary particulate emissions, reducing the emissions of secondary aerosol precursors from, for example, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning is likely to be important for controlling China\u2019s PM2.5 levels and for reducing the environmental, economic and health impacts resulting from particulate pollution.",

        "description": "\n\nThe science that humans are the cause of global warming, and that the associated climate change would lead to serious changes in climate extreme events, food production, freshwater resources, biodiversity, human mortality, etc. is unequivocal. After several political negotiations, a 2\u2009\u00b0C warming has been considered to be the benchmark for such damaging changes. However, an increasing amount of scientific research indicates that higher levels of warming are increasingly likely. What would the world be like if such higher levels of warming occurred? This study aims to provide information for better politically driven mitigation through an investigation of the changes in temperature- and precipitation-based extreme indices using CMIP5 (coupled model intercomparison project phase 5) simulations of a warming of 1, 2, and 3\u2009\u00b0C in China. Warming simulations show more dramatic effects in China compared with the global average. In general, the results show relatively small change signals in climate extreme events in China at 1\u2009\u00b0C, larger anomalies at 2\u2009\u00b0C, and stronger and more extended anomalies at 3\u2009\u00b0C. Changes in the studied temperature indices indicate that warm events would be more frequent and stronger in the future, and that cold events would be reduced and weakened. For changes in the precipitation indices, extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation, and China will experience more intensified extreme precipitation events. Furthermore, the risk of flooding is projected to increase, and the dry conditions over northern China are projected to be mitigated. In certain regions, particularly Southwest China, the risks of both drought and flood events would likely increase despite the decreased total precipitation in the future. Uncertainties mainly derived from inter-model and scenario variabilities are attached to these projections, but a high model agreement can be generally observed in the likelihood of these extreme changes.\n",
