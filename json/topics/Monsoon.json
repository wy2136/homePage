In this study, the trend and temporal variation of extreme precipitation are analyzed using daily precipitation datasets at 11 stations over the arid inland Heihe River basin in Northwest China from 1960 to 2011. Eight indices of extreme precipitation are studied. The results show statistically significant and large-magnitude increasing and decreasing trends for most indices, primarily in the Qilian Mountains and eastern Hexi Corridor. More frequent and intense rainfall extremes have occurred in the southern part of the desert area than in the northern portion. In general, the temporal variation in precipitation extremes has changed throughout the basin. Wet day precipitation and heavy precipitation days show statistically significant linear increasing trends and step changes in the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor. Consecutive dry days have decreased obviously in the region in most years after approximately the late 1980s, but meanwhile very long dry spells have increased, especially in the Hexi Corridor. The probability density function indicates that very long wet spells have increased in the QilianMountains. The East Asian summer monsoon index and western Pacific subtropical high intensity index possess strong and significant negative and positive correlations with rainfall extremes, respectively. Changes in land surface characteristics and the increase in water vapor in the wet season have also contributed to the changes in precipitation extremes over the river basin.</p>\n                  ",

        "description": "\n\nThe observed summertime drying over Northern Central India (NCI) during the latter half of the 20th century is not reproduced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble average. At the same time, the spread between precipitation trends from individual model realizations is large, indicating that internal variability potentially plays an important role in explaining the observed trend. Here we show that the drying is indeed related to the observed 1950-1999 positive trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and that the relationship is even stronger for a simpler index (S1). Adjusting the CMIP5 simulated precipitation trends to account for the difference between the observed and simulated S1 trend increases the original multi-model average NCI drying trend from \u22120.09\u00b10.31 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 to \u22120.51\u00b10.40 mm day\u22121 (50 years)\u22121 . Thus, our estimate of the 1950-1999 NCI drying associated with Pacific decadal variability is of similar magnitude as our previous CMIP5 based estimate of the drying due to anthropogenic aerosol. The drying (moistening) associated with increasing (decreasing) S1 can partially be attributed to a southeastward (northwestward) shift of the boundary between ascent and descent affecting NCI. This shift of the ascent region strongly affects NCI, butnot Southeast Asia and south China. The average spread between individual model realizations is only slightly reduced when adjusting for S1 as smaller scale variability also plays an important role.\n",

        "description": "\n\nCorrelations of 1\u00b0 by 1\u00b0 seasonal rainfall with Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reveal spatially distinct teleconnections between El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall over the full monsoon season, as well as three subseasons. Over the full season (June\u2013September), Pacific SSTs correlate with rainfall in Western India more than that in Eastern India. This spatial signature shifts as the monsoon progresses through early (June), middle or peak (July\u2013August), and late (September) subseasons. Specifically, a 1\u00b0C cooling of the central equatorial Pacific (i.e., La Ni\u00f1a conditions) can result in the following: \u223c70\u2013100% increase in precipitation in north central Indian and the Indo-Gangetic Plains during the early season, \u223c30\u201380% increase peak season precipitation in south central India and northwestern Rajasthan, and \u223c60\u2013100% increase in late season precipitation in northern, northwestern, and central India. Furthermore, the spatial signatures between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o are asymmetric in that for a particular location, the enhancement and suppression of rainfall associated with La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions, respectively, are not equal. El Ni\u00f1o suppresses peak season rainfall in the south central and northwestern Rajasthan regions more than La Ni\u00f1a enhances it, but the opposite occurs during the late season in northern, northwestern, and central India. Additionally, the correspondence of minima (maxima) in anomalies of velocity potential aloft with maxima (minima) at 925\u00a0mb and with positive (negative) surface pressure anomalies suggests that anomalous subsidence (ascent) occurs in July\u2013September during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) times. In the early season, however, patterns of velocity potential composites suggest a region of descent (ascent) over the western equatorial Indian Ocean, along with a region of ascent (descent) over the Indian subcontinent that exists only during the early season but not during the peak or late season. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that local Hadley cell circulation affects pressure and thus rainfall during the early season but that a larger-scale mechanism, such as eastward or westward shifts in the Walker circulation, may be more responsible for teleconnections seen throughout the remainder of the season. These findings indicate that focusing monsoon forecasting efforts on these regions and on subseasonal periods while incorporating ENSO asymmetries will yield useful and skillful regional forecasts, compared to the declining utility and skill of all-India summer monsoon rainfall.\n",

Ozone data are grouped and analysed according to the air-mass residence time over the central India, marine region and Africa/Middle East regions. Ozone shows a linear dependence on air-mass residence time over the central India region for about six days.

To date, the underlying mechanisms and sustaining factors have not been positively elucidated. Based on the concept of dynamical system model reconstruction, this paper presents a nonlinear statistical\u2013dynamical model of the subtropical high ridge line (SHRL) in concurrence with four summer monsoon factors. SHRL variations from 1990 to 2011 are subdivided into three categories, while parameter differences relating to three differing models are examined. Dynamical characteristics of SHRL are analyzed and an aberrance mechanism subsequently developed. Modeling suggests that different parameters may lead to significant variance pertaining to monsoon variables corresponding with numerous WPSH activities. Dynamical system bifurcation and mutation indicates that the South China Sea monsoon trough is a significant factor with respect to the occurrence and maintenance of the \u2018double-ridge\u2019 phenomenon. Moreover, the occurrence of the Mascarene cold high is predicted to cause an abnormal northward location of WPSH, resulting in the \u201cempty plum\u201d phenomenon.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

It has been found that a significantly enhanced East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is characterized by increased rainfall in northern China and by reduced rainfall in southern China, and this relationship occurs on different time scales during the Holocene. This study presents results from a diverse range of proxy paleoclimatic records from northern China where precipitation variability is traditionally considered as an EASM proxy. Our aim is to evaluate the evolution of the EASM during the Holocene and to compare it with all of the published stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the Asian monsoon region in order to explore the potential mechanism(s) controlling the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O. We found that the intensity of the EASM during the Holocene recorded by the traditional EASM proxy of moisture (or precipitation) records from northern China is significantly different from the Chinese stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records. The EASM maximum occurred during the mid-Holocene, challenging the prevailing view of an early Holocene EASM maximum mainly inferred from stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in eastern China. In addition, all of the well-dated Holocene stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records, covering a broad geographical region, exhibit a remarkably similar trend of variation and are statistically well-correlated on different time scales, thus indicating a common signal. However, in contrast with the clear consistency in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in all of the cave records, both instrumental and paleoclimatic records exhibit significant spatial variations in rainfall on decadal-to-centennial time scales over eastern China. In addition, both paleoclimatic records and modeling results suggest that Holocene East Asian summer monsoon precipitation reached a maximum at different periods in different regions of China. Thus the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, modern observations indicate that the moisture for precipitation in the East Asian monsoon region is mainly derived from the Indian Ocean. The moisture transport route from the Indian Ocean to the East Asian monsoon region during the Holocene is almost identical to that of modern precipitation. Therefore the strong correlation of \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records in the EASM and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regions, and the similarity of the pattern of latitudinal changes in \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O values in stalagmites and in modern meteoric precipitation along the water vapor transport route, further suggests that the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records from the EASM region are essentially a signal of the isotopic composition of precipitation, which is determined mainly by changes in the \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O of atmospheric vapor in the upstream source region over the Indian Ocean and Indian Monsoon region via the upstream depletion mechanism. Finally, the main trends of the stalagmite \u03b4<sup loc=\"pre\">18</sup>O records are strongly correlated with the known evolution of the ISM, and therefore these records reflect the history of the ISM rather than that of the EASM. Our findings support the conclusion that EASM variability is mainly controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and was strongly modulated by ice volume during the last deglaciation and early Holocene, which delayed the response of the EASM maximum to peak insolation forcing.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study synthesizes existing clay mineralogical and geochemical data from ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>1500 samples from the seafloor and surrounding rivers, deepwater mooring observation results, and high-resolution glacial-cyclic clay mineralogy records from six high-quality sediment cores. Source-to-sink sediment transport from the river mouth to the continental shelf and then to the abyssal basin is investigated at two time scales: modern process and Late Quaternary glacial cycles. The results firstly show the high diversity of clay mineralogical and geochemical compositions in riverbed surface sediments surrounding the South China Sea, e.g., dominant illite and chlorite in Taiwan, overwhelming majority of smectite in Luzon, dominant kaolinite in South China, and similar amounts of the four clay mineral species in Red and Mekong river systems. The formation of these fluvial sediments through chemical weathering in surrounding drainage systems is controlled principally by the East Asian monsoon climate with warm temperature and high precipitation, and subordinately by tectonic activity and specific lithological character. The basin-wide distribution of clay mineral assemblages combined with neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions reflects strong provenance control and differential settling effects. The differential settling of kaolinite in slightly saline and proximal regions relative to smectite in more saline and distal regions is well demonstrated in the South China Sea. Through combining clay mineralogical distributions on the seafloor with observed oceanic current systems, the modern transport pathways can be well established, e.g., in the northern South China Sea, illite and chlorite from Taiwan are mainly carried by contour currents with the strong influence of mesoscale eddies.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0010\" view=\"all\">High-resolution sediment dynamic analysis for the Late Quaternary reveals different sediment transport patterns in the northern, western, and southern South China Sea when the land-sea configuration dramatically changed during glacial conditions. In the north, the terrigenous dispersal is mainly controlled by provenance supply and oceanic current transport. In the west, the clay mineral assemblage reflects variations of the prevailing surface current influenced by monsoon winds. In the south, the clay mineral input indicates intensive chemical weathering during interglacial periods and strengthened physical erosion during glacial periods. The transport of terrigenous sediments since the last glaciation is quantitatively reconstructed through studying two deepwater sediment cores located in the northern South China Sea. The relative contributions from three provenances (South China, Luzon, and Taiwan) highlight their distinct variability over the last 28<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, implying that the southward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at 16<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka BP caused an increased sediment contribution from South China, the intensified influence of the Kuroshio Current intrusion controls more efficient westward transport of Luzon sediments, and the stronger deepwater current transports Taiwan-sourced sediments further westward from the last glaciation to the Holocene.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Lake level increased to at least 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, post Younger Dryas cooling.

This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana.

Since the magnetoclimatological signals studied here are obviously controlled by both pedogenesis and wind vigor, measurements of magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), both of which are responsive to both ultrafine pedogenic magnetic particles and eolian coarse-grained pseudo-single domain/multi-domain magnetic particles, could not provide unambiguous interpretation of the magnetic response to the East Asian summer monsoon intensity. In contrast, anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and the percentage of frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7<inf loc=\"post\">fd</inf>%), which are notably responsive to ultrafine magnetic particles, can aptly trace changes in the concentration of pedogenic magnetic particles and can therefore be used as reliable proxies of pedogenic intensity. The magnetic grain size dependent proxies, e.g., ARM/\u03c7 and ARM/M<inf loc=\"post\">s</inf> (M<inf loc=\"post\">s</inf>, saturation magnetization), geochemical indices (e.g., chemical index of alteration, Zr/Rb and Al/Si ratios), and bulk grain size records all exhibit concordant variations and are more straightforward proxies for addressing the East Asian monsoon variability. Therefore the combination of multi-parameter mineral magnetic, geochemical and grain size analyses is very useful for distinguishing, delimiting and correlating loess sequences, and for accurately deciphering their paleoclimatic signals embedded in the weakly weathered loess. As the classical precipitation-driven pedogenic model for magnetic susceptibility enhancement is not entirely applicable to the early- to mid-Pleistocene loess developed in the semi-arid western CLP, considerable caution should also be warranted in using magnetic susceptibility measurements alone in the quantitative reconstruction of paleoprecipitation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

During the first part of the Holocene between 11,300 and 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP, characterized by high insolation (minimum precession, maximum obliquity), the maximum extension of the coastal forest and mangrove reflects high monsoon rainfall. This climatic regime contrasts with that of the second phase of the Holocene, from 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP to the present, marked by the development of drier vegetation in a context of low insolation (maximum precession, minimum obliquity). The historical period in India is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak monsoon centennial phases that may reflect the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. During the HS 2, a period of low insolation and extensive iceberg discharge in the North Atlantic Ocean, vegetation was dominated by grassland and dry flora indicating pronounced aridity as the result of a weak Indian summer monsoon.

(1) El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation variability, while the most important global-scale mode of interannual climate variation, is insufficient to explain most of the variation of tropical South American climate observed in both the instrumental and the paleoclimate records. (2) Significant climate variation in tropical South America occurs on seasonal to orbital (i.e. multi-millennial) time scales as a result of sea-surface temperature (SST) variation and ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions of the tropical Atlantic. (3) Decadal-scale climate variability, linked with this tropical Atlantic variability, has been a persistent characteristic of climate in tropical South America for at least the past half millennium, and likely, far beyond. (4) Centennial-to-millennial climate events in tropical South America were of longer duration and, perhaps, larger amplitude than any observed in the instrumental period, which is little more than a century long in tropical South America. These were superimposed upon both precession-paced insolation changes that caused significant variation in SASM precipitation and eccentricity-paced global glacial boundary conditions that caused significant changes in the tropical South American moisture balance. As a result, river sediment and water discharge increased and decreased across tropical South America, lake levels rose and fell, paleolakes arose and disappeared on the Altiplano, glaciers waxed and waned in the tropical Andes, and the tropical rainforest underwent significant changes in composition and extent.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"abspara0015\" view=\"all\">To further evaluate climate forcing over the last glacial cycle (\u223c125\u00a0ka), we developed a climate forcing model that combines summer insolation forcing and a proxy for North Atlantic SST forcing to reconstruct long-term precipitation variation in the SASM domain. The success of this model reinforces our confidence in assigning causation to observed reconstructions of precipitation. In addition, we propose a critical correction for speleothem stable oxygen isotopic ratios, which are among the most significant of paleoclimate proxies in tropical South America for reconstruction of variation of paleo-precipitation (or SASM intensity). However, it is already well known that any particular \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O value observed in speleothem carbonate is affected by two processes that have nothing to do with changes in precipitation amount\u2014the influence of temperature on carbonate-water isotopic fractionation in the cave and the influence of changing \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O of seawater. Quantitatively accounting for both \u201cartifacts\u201d can significantly alter the interpretations of speleothem records. In tropical South America, both adjustments act in the same direction and have the tendency to increase the true amplitude of the paleo-hydrologic signal (but by different amounts in glacial and inter-glacial stages). These corrections have even graver implications for the interpretation of tropical Northern Hemisphere speleothem records (e.g. Chinese speleothems) where the combined adjustments tend to decrease or even eliminate the \u201ctrue\u201d signal amplitude.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The robust chronology of the presented record is based on varve counting and AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant macro-remains. In addition to the qualitative interpretation of the pollen data, we provide quantitative reconstructions of vegetation and climate based on the method of biomization and weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) technique, respectively. Power spectra were computed to investigate the frequency domain distribution of proxy signals and potential natural periodicities. Pollen assemblages, pollen-derived biome scores and climate variables as well as the cyclicity pattern indicate that NE China experienced significant changes in temperature and moisture conditions during the Holocene. Within the earliest phase of the Holocene, a large-scale reorganization of vegetation occurred, reflecting the reconstructed shift towards higher temperatures and precipitation values and the initial Holocene strengthening and northward expansion of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Afterwards, summer temperatures remain at a high level, whereas the reconstructed precipitation shows an increasing trend until approximately 4000\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP. Since 3500\u00a0cal.\u00a0yr BP, temperature and precipitation values decline, indicating moderate cooling and weakening of the EASM. A distinct periodicity of 550\u2013600 years and evidence of a Mid\u2013Holocene transition from a temperature-triggered to a predominantly moisture-triggered climate regime are derived from the power spectra analysis. The results obtained from SHL are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records from NE China, substantiating the regional nature of the reconstructed vegetation and climate patterns. However, the reconstructed climate changes contrast with the moisture evolution recorded in S China and the mid-latitude (semi-)arid regions of N China. Whereas a clear insolation-related trend of monsoon intensity over the Holocene is lacking from the SHL record, variations in the coupled atmosphere-Pacific Ocean system can largely explain the reconstructed changes in NE China.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We investigate the separate precession and obliquity forcing of the freshwater budget over the Mediterranean using a high-resolution coupled climate model, EC-Earth. At times of enhanced insolation seasonality, i.e. minimum precession and maximum obliquity, the area was wetter and the Mediterranean Sea surface was less saline. The latter has been attributed to increased runoff from the south as a consequence of a strengthened North African monsoon, as well as to increased precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea itself. Our results show that both mechanisms play a role in changing the freshwater budget. Increased monsoon runoff occurs in summer during times of enhanced insolation seasonality, especially minimum precession, while increased precipitation is important in winter for both precession and obliquity. We relate changes in winter precipitation to changes in the air-sea temperature difference and subsequently, convective precipitation. The freshening in the minimum precession and maximum obliquity experiments has a strong effect on Mediterranean sea surface salinity and mixed layer depth, thereby likely influencing deep sea circulation and sedimentation at the ocean bottom.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Large tropical river systems dominate the export of Si from the continents to the oceans. Here, we investigate variations in Si cycling in the upper White Nile basin over the last 15\u00a0ka, using sediment cores from Lakes Victoria and Edward. Coupled measurements of stable O and Si isotopes on diatom separates were used to reconstruct past changes in lake hydrology and Si cycling, while the abundances of lipid biomarkers characteristic of terrestrial/emergent higher plants, submerged/floating aquatic macrophytes and freshwater algae document past ecosystem changes. During the late-glacial to mid-Holocene, 15\u20135.5\u00a0ka BP, orbital forcing greatly enhanced monsoon rainfall, forest cover and chemical weathering. Riverine inputs of dissolved silica from the lake catchments exceeded aquatic demand and may also have had lower Si-isotope values. Since 5.5\u00a0ka BP, increasingly dry climates and more open vegetation, reinforced by the spread of agricultural cropland over the last 3\u20134\u00a0ka, have reduced dissolved silica inputs into the lakes.

However, the results from the method developed in this study involving virtual stations show that the CryoSat-2 data can indeed be used for such monitoring by utilizing the high spatial coverage and the sub-cycle period of 30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days. The results show that it is possible to capture the peak flow occurring during late summer due to monsoonal precipitation and the melting of snow in the Himalayas. The evaluation of CryoSat-2 river levels is performed by comparing with Envisat data in terms of annual signals and amplitudes. The obtained annual amplitudes agree well with the Envisat data, although CryoSat-2 exhibit larger differences. For five virtual stations in the Brahmaputra River, the mean difference between the obtained amplitudes is ~<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>10<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>cm, whereas the mean phase difference is less than 2.7<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>days.

Over exploitation of water resources, weather variability and climate change are mostly responsible for such exacerbation. The impacts of droughts encompass the global ecosystem as a whole but vary from region to region. Least developed countries (LDCs) are becoming the worst sufferer of the impacts due to physical, social and economic as well as knowledge and skills differences. The increasing biophysical vulnerability contexts and intensity in the Asian LDCs causing adverse effects on food security, human health, biodiversity, water resources, hydroelectric power generation, streams, perennial springs, and livelihood. Drought is also responsible for increasing pollution, pests and diseases and forced migration and famine. Information indicates monsoon has become erratic contributing to up-scaling of droughts. South and Southeast Asian LDCs like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia and Lao PDR under the monsoon climatic zone have also been suffering from increasing droughts arising out of delayed and changing distribution patterns of precipitation. Prolong dry spells increase the frequencies of wildfire in grasslands, forests, and range-lands. The rain-fed crops of the plains are facing challenges from soil-moisture stress with projected droughts. Droughts causing migration of fishes, and marine anadromus species are having adverse impacts on spawning habitats. Reduction in annual surface runoff is decreasing the ground and surface water with negative effect on agriculture and water supply for industrial and domestic sectors. As droughts are exacerbating the consequences are accelerating. However, traditionally people are adapting with the changing situations applying indigenous knowledge and practices for sustainable living. This paper reflects on prevalence and impacts of droughts, existing coping mechanisms, initiatives to combat impacts and further doubles in the context of Asian LDCs.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Peak Over Threshold method (POT) was used for the sample selection. The possible range of threshold values were identified by using the Mean residual life plot and the specific threshold value was selected using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). Using the POT method, the GPD was fitted for the sampled data and the special type of GPD was identified statistically.

In the rainfed ecosystem (RE), wheat production is impinged on certain climatic events per se high variability in rainfall and increased temperature. These climatic events turn out due to climatic drivers like Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and pressure. Current study is aimed to analyze long term rainfall data (1961\u20132011) of Pakistan\u05f3s rainfed ecosystem zone (Islamabad, Chakwal and Talagang) by using Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and R model. The principal objective of this analysis was to study the link between SOI phases and SSTs; and thereby understanding the pattern of climate change due to these climatic drivers under rainfed conditions in Pakistan. The results revealed a positive link between July SOI phases and the rainfall variability during October\u2013November (the sowing time of wheat in Pakistan). Long term rainfall data analysis (1961\u20132011) of Islamabad, Chakwal and Talagang revealed 44%, 40%, 35% possibility of exceeding median rainfall near zero whereas probability of consistently negative SOI phases were 35%, 34% and 33% respectively during July. Similarly, the forecasting results estimated by R using covariates like dry spell, NINO1.2, NINO3, NINO4, NINO3.4 and IOD of different months revealed that prediction of monsoon, wheat early growth, wheat grain filling period and total wheat growing season rainfall, have significant signals with climatic drivers.

In this study, three numerical experiments are carried out. The first is the control and includes no assimilation; in the second, named Conv, assimilation of conventional Global Telecommunication System data is performed. The third one, named ConvAIRS, is identical to the Conv except that it also includes assimilation of AIRS profiles. The initial fields of tropospheric temperature and water vapor mixing ratio showed significant improvement over the model domain. Assimilation of AIRS profiles has significant impact on predicting the seasonal mean monsoon characteristics such as tropospheric temperature, low-level moisture distribution, easterly wind shear, and precipitation. The vertical structure of the root-mean-square error is substantially affected by the assimilation of AIRS profiles, with smaller errors in temperature, humidity, and wind magnitude. The consequent improved representation of moisture convergence in the boundary layer (deep convection as well) causes an increase in precipitation forecast skill. The fact that the monsoonal circulation is better captured, thanks to an improved representation of thermal gradients, which in turn leads to more realistic moisture transport, is particularly noteworthy. Several previous data impact studies with AIRS and other sensors have focused on the short or medium range of the forecast. The demonstrated improvement in all the predicted fields associated with the Indian summer monsoon, consequent to the month long assimilation of AIRS profiles, is an innovative finding with large implications to the operational seasonal forecasting capabilities over the Indian subcontinent.\n",

The models simulate periods with in-phase seasonal precipitation anomalies, but the strength of this relationship is variable on multidecadal time scales, behavior that is also exhibited by the reconstructions. The models, however, are unable to simulate periods with consistently out-of-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies as observed in the latter part of the instrumental interval. The periods with predominantly in-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies in the models are significant against randomness, and while this result is suggestive of a potential for dual-season drought on interannual and longer time scales, models do not consistently exhibit the persistent dual-season drought seen in the dendroclimatic reconstructions. These collective findings indicate that model-derived drought risk assessments may underestimate the potential for dual-season drought in 21st century projections of hydroclimate in the American Southwest and parts of Mexico.\n",

In this study, we use the atmospheric model WRF configured with high-spatial resolution to understand seasonal patterns of near-surface meteorological fields and precipitation processes in the Langtang catchment in the central Himalaya. Using a unique high-altitude observational network, we evaluate a simulation from 17 June 2012 to 16 June 2013 and conclude that, at 1-km horizontal grid spacing, the model captures the main features of observed meteorological variability in the catchment. The finer representation of the complex terrain and explicit simulation of convection at this grid spacing give strong improvements in near-surface air temperature and small improvements in precipitation, in particular in the magnitudes of daytime convective precipitation and at higher elevations. The seasonal differences are noteworthy, including a reversal in the vertical and along-valley distributions of precipitation between the monsoon and winter seasons, with peak values simulated at lower altitudes (~3000 m a.s.l) and in the upper regions (above 5000 m a.s.l.) in each season, respectively. We conclude that there is great potential for improving the local accuracy of climate change impact studies in the Himalaya by using high-resolution atmospheric models to generate the forcing for such studies.\n",

An Arabian winter monsoon index (AWMI) is defined to highlight the Arabian Peninsula as the most representative region for the northern hemispheric winter rainfall. The observations show that the rainfall variability is relatively large over the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula. The correlation coefficient between the Ni\u00f1o3.4 index and rainfall in this region is 0.33, statistically significant at 90% level, suggesting potentially some modest predictability, and indicating that El Ni\u00f1o increases and La Ni\u00f1a decreases the rainfall. Regression analysis shows that upper-level cyclonic circulation anomalies that are forced by El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are responsible for the winter rainfall anomalies over the Arabian region. The stronger (weaker) mean transient eddy activity related to the upper-level trough induced by the warm (cold) SSTs during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) tends to increase (decrease) the rainfall in the region. The model hindcast dataset reproduces the ENSO-rainfall connection. The seasonal mean predictability of northeast Arabian rainfall index is 0.35, statistically significant at 95% level. It is shown that the noise variance is larger than the signal over the Arabian Peninsula region, which tends to limit the prediction skill. The potential predictability is generally increased in ENSO years and is, in particular, larger during La Ni\u00f1a compared to El Ni\u00f1o years in the region. Furthermore, central Pacific ENSO events and ENSO events with weak signals in the Indian Ocean tend to increase predictability over the Arabian region.\n",

Observations show that break days are more in number (\u223c2\u20133 times) and long lasting (\u223c15\u201320 days) than active days in El Ni\u00f1o developing summers and vice versa for decay years. During El Ni\u00f1o developing years, northward propagation is well organized with significant anomalies in both active and break phases. The increased convection associated with active phase persists longer over Indian Ocean, than over the monsoon region, while the reduced convection in break phase propagates faster from ocean to land and persists there for a longer time. Compared to break events, active events have slower (faster) propagation over the monsoon (oceanic) region during El Nino decay years. The present study put forward the argument that the contrasting persistent circulations over Indo-western Pacific regions favour particular phase of intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO) in developing and decay phase of El Nino. These long-lasting circulations advect anomalous dry (moist) air to ISM region for longer period, resulting in long-lasting break (active) events in El Ni\u00f1o developing (decay) years. During co-occurrence years, the number of break (active) days is reduced by two to three times compared to the developing (decaying) phase of El Ni\u00f1o. It is found that 30- to 60-day scale ISO is strongly modulated, than 10 - to 20-day scale, by the changes in seasonal mean state associated with El Nino. Thus, this study demonstrates that the ISO characteristics such as its variance, northward propagation, spatial distribution and duration of active and break days are strongly modulated by seasonal background anomalies over the Indo-Pacific region.\n",

One decade observations are used to assess the performance of various MPEs (climate prediction center (CPC)-South Asia dataset, CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks (PERSIANN), tropical rainfall measuring mission's (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA-3B42) and global precipitation climatology project (GPCP)). All MPEs have high detection skills of rain with larger probability of detection (POD) and smaller \u2018misses\u2019 values. However, the detection sensitivity differs from one product (and also one region) to the other. While the CMORPH has the lowest sensitivity of detecting rain, CPC shows highest sensitivity and often over detects rain, as evidenced by large POD and false alarm ratio (FAR) and small \u2018misses\u2019 values. All MPEs show higher rain sensitivity over eastern India than western India. These differential sensitivities are found to alter the biases in rain amount differently. All MPEs show similar spatial patterns of seasonal rain bias and root mean square error (RMSE), but their spatial variability across India is complex and pronounced. The MPEs overestimate the rainfall over the dry regions (northwest and southeast India) and severely underestimate over mountainous regions (west coast and northeast India), whereas the bias is relatively small over the core monsoon zone. Higher occurrence of virga rain due to sub-cloud evaporation and possible missing of small-scale convective events by gauges over the dry regions are the main reasons for the observed overestimation of rain by MPEs. The decomposed components of total bias show that the major part of overestimation is due to false precipitation. The severe underestimation of rain along the west coast is attributed to the predominant occurrence of shallow rain and underestimation of moderate to heavy rain by MPEs. The decomposed components suggest that the missed precipitation and hit bias are the leading error sources for the total bias along the west coast. All evaluation metrics are found to be nearly equal in two contrasting monsoon seasons (southwest and northeast), indicating that the performance of MPEs doesn't change with the season, at least over southeast India. Among various MPEs, the performance of TMPA is found to be better than others, as it reproduced most of the spatial variability exhibited by the reference.\n",

While previous studies have documented precipitation characteristics in the Himalayan region during severe storm cases, a comprehensive understanding of circulation dynamics of extreme precipitation mechanisms is still warranted. In this study, a detailed analysis is performed using rainfall observations and reanalysis circulation products to understand the evolution of monsoon-extratropical circulation features and their interactions based on 34 extreme precipitation events which occurred in the Western Himalayas (WEH) during the period 1979\u20132013. Our results provide evidence for a common large-scale circulation pattern connecting the extratropics and the South Asian monsoon region, which is favorable for extreme precipitation occurrences in the WEH region. This background upper level large-scale circulation pattern consists of a deep southward penetrating midlatitude westerly trough, a blocking high over western Eurasia and an intensifying Tibetan anticyclone. It is further seen from our analysis that the key elements of monsoon-midlatitude interactions, responsible for extreme precipitation events over the WEH region, are: (1) midlatitude Rossby wave breaking, (2) west-northwest propagation of monsoon low-pressure system from the Bay of Bengal across the Indian subcontinent, (3) eddy shedding of the Tibetan anticyclone, (4) ageostrophic motions and transverse circulation across the Himalayas, and (5) strong moist convection over the Himalayan foothills. Furthermore, high-resolution numerical simulations indicate that diabatic heating and mesoscale ageostrophic effects can additionally amplify the convective motions and precipitation in the WEH region.</p>\n                ",

The processes maintaining these maxima are not well understood. We analyze the variability of water vapor in the monsoon regions based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations during 2005\u20132013 and quantify links to deep convection, large-scale temperatures, and monsoonal circulations. Strong subseasonal variations in stratospheric water vapor are closely linked with deep convection in the monsoon regions, with the surprising result that stronger convection leads to a relatively dry stratosphere and weaker convection to a wetter stratosphere. This result is observed for both the Asian and NA monsoon regions. This behavior is explained by temperature changes in the stratosphere tied to deep convection: stronger convection leads to relatively cold temperatures in the subtropical lower stratosphere, which is the key region controlling large-scale dehydration within the anticyclonic monsoonal circulations. Likewise, weaker convection leads to warmer subtropical stratospheric temperatures, relatively less dehydration, and enhanced water vapor. The observed water vapor changes are in approximate agreement with those expected from the subtropical temperature variations, taking into account dilution of the dehydrated air into the larger monsoon region. These results demonstrate that stratospheric water vapor in the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation and temperatures, and overshooting deep convection plays a relatively minor role.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn this study, we adopt a parametric sensitivity analysis framework that integrates the quasi-Monte Carlo parameter sampling approach and a surrogate model to examine aerosol effects on the East Asian Monsoon climate simulated in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5). A total number of 256 CAM5 simulations are conducted to quantify the model responses to the uncertain parameters associated with cloud microphysics parameterizations and aerosol (e.g., sulfate, black carbon (BC), and dust) emission factors and their interactions. Results show that the interaction terms among parameters are important for quantifying the sensitivity of fields of interest, especially precipitation, to the parameters. The relative importance of cloud-microphysics parameters and emission factors (strength) depends on evaluation metrics or the model fields we focused on, and the presence of uncertainty in cloud microphysics imposes an additional challenge in quantifying the impact of aerosols on cloud and climate.\nDue to their different optical and microphysical properties and spatial distributions, sulfate, BC, and dust aerosols have very different impacts on East Asian Monsoon through aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. The climatic effects of aerosol do not always have a monotonic response to the change of emission factors. The spatial patterns of both sign and magnitude of aerosol-induced changes in radiative fluxes, cloud, and precipitation could be different, depending on the aerosol types, when parameters are sampled in different ranges of values. We also identify the different cloud microphysical parameters that show the most significant impact on climatic effect induced by sulfate, BC and dust, respectively, in East Asia.\n",

Here we make use of 10\u2009years of snow pit and short core \u03b418O data and hourly snow-height measurements obtained by an automated weather station deployed at the ice cap's summit to analyze linkages between snowfall, \u03b418O, and the South American summer monsoon (SASM). Snow accumulation peaks in December and is negative May\u2013September. Snow \u03b418O values decrease gradually through austral summer from about \u221217 to \u221224\u2030. Surface snow \u03b418O is altered after deposition during austral winter from about \u221224 to \u221215\u2030. More than 70% of the total snow accumulation is tied to convection along the leading edge of cold air incursions of midlatitude air advected equatorward from southern South America. Snowfall amplitude at Quelccaya Ice Cap varies systematically with regional precipitation, atmospheric dynamics, midtroposphere humidity, and water vapor \u03b4D. Strongest snowfall gains correspond with positive precipitation anomalies over the western Amazon Basin, increased humidity, and lowered water vapor \u03b4D values, consistent with the \u201camount effect.\u201d We discuss ventilation of the monsoon, modulated by midlatitude cold air advection, as potentially diagnostic of the relationship between SASM dynamics and Quelccaya snowfall.

Results show that when increased aerosol loading is found on the Himalayas slopes in the pre-monsoon period (April-May), intensification of early monsoon rainfall over India and increased low-level westerly flow follow, in agreement with the Elevated-Heat-Pump mechanism. The increase in rainfall during the early monsoon season has a cooling effect on the land surface. In the same period, enhanced surface cooling may also be amplified through solar dimming by more cloudiness and aerosol loading, via increased dust transported by low-level westerly flow. The surface cooling causes subsequent reduction in monsoon rainfall in July-August over India. The time-lagged nature of the reasonably realistic response of the model to aerosol forcing suggests that absorbing aerosols, besides their potential key roles in impacting monsoon water cycle and climate, may influence the seasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon.\n",

The observed concentration of total gaseous Hg (TGM) was 3.3\u00b11.4 ng m\u22123. During the sampling period, gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) and particulate bound Hg (PBM) were 6.7\u00b14.3 pg m\u22123 and 180\u00b1110 pg m\u22123 in winter, and 5.9\u00b13.4 pg m\u22123 and 130\u00b1100 pg m\u22123 in spring. The relatively high mean concentration of TGM was mainly caused by regional anthropogenic emissions and occasional long-range transport from domestic source regions. Seasonal variation in the TGM concentration was observed with lower values in the wet monsoon season (from May to September) and higher values in the dry monsoon season (from October to April). Backward trajectories and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis suggested that anthropogenic Hg emission from coal combustion in the Yangtze River Delta region was the most likely cause for the elevated TGM concentrations. Relatively clean air originating from the East China Sea was the most possible cause for the observed low TGM concentrations. Positive correlation between TGM concentration and air quality index (AQI) suggests that emissions that influenced regional air quality contributed to the elevated TGM concentrations.\n",

We divided all precipitation events into four non-overlapping categories: light, moderate, heavy and very heavy based on percentile thresholds. We then established the trends for annual total and precipitation of different intensity categories, and examined their regional and seasonal variations. The results show that there was little change in annual total precipitation for entire China, but distinctive regional patterns existed. In general, precipitation increased in the west and decreased in east. Precipitation of different intensities, in general, changed in the same direction as the mean, but heavy and very heavy precipitation events had higher rates of change than mean precipitation. The exception was the southeast region, where despite the slight decrease in mean precipitation, heavy and very heavy precipitation still increased significantly. In addition, we used multiple regression models to explore the contribution of changes of frequency and intensity to total precipitation change, and the contributions of changes of precipitation at different intensities to total precipitation change. For western China, total precipitation change was associated more with frequency change, whereas in eastern China intensity contributed more. For precipitation amount, moderate, heavy and very heavy precipitations contributed to the total change, with little contribution from light precipitation change. For frequency, changes in light and moderate precipitation frequencies dominated the total change, with very little contributions from heavy and very heavy precipitation frequency changes. In addition, we examined the linkage between summer precipitation in eastern China and the East-Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), found that the northern decrease and southern increase in summer precipitation was likely caused by the weakening of EASM over the study period.\n",

This paper reviews and synthesizes studies using the TRMM radar data to present a global picture of the variation of convection throughout low latitudes. The multi-year dataset shows convection varying not only in amount but also in its very nature across the oceans, continents, islands, and mountain ranges of the tropics and subtropics. Shallow isolated raining clouds are overwhelmingly an oceanic phenomenon. Extremely deep and intense convective elements occur almost exclusively over land. Upscale growth of convection into mesoscale systems takes a variety of forms. Oceanic cloud systems generally have less intense embedded convection but can form very wide stratiform regions. Continental mesoscale systems often have more intense embedded convection. Some of the most intense convective cells and mesoscale systems occur near the great mountain ranges of low latitudes. The Maritime Continent and Amazonia exhibit convective clouds with maritime characteristics although they are partially or wholly land. Convective systems containing broad stratiform areas manifest most strongly over oceans. The stratiform precipitation occurs in various forms. Often it occurs as quasi-uniform precipitation with strong melting layers connected with intense convection. In monsoons and the intertropical convergence zone, it takes the form of closely packed weak convective elements.

In this study, we classify the circulation types using the self-organizing maps based on the daily field of 500\u00a0hPa geopotential height and link them to the precipitation climatology in the eastern and central TP. By virtue of an objective determining method, 18 circulation types are quantified. The results show that the large amount of precipitation in summer is closely related to the circulation types in which the enhanced and northward shifted subtropical high (SH) over the northwest Pacific and the obvious cyclconic circulation anomaly over the Bay of Bengal are helpful for the Indian summer monsoon and East Asian summer monsoon to take abundant low-latitude moisture to the eastern and southern TP. On the contrary, the dry winter in the central and eastern Tibet corresponds to the circulation types with divergence over the central and eastern TP and the water vapor transportations of East Asian winter monsoon and mid-latitude westerly are very weak. Some circulation types are associated with some well-known circulation patterns/monsoons influencing the TP (e.g. East Atlantic Pattern, El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, Indian Summer Monsoon and the mid-latitude westerly), and exhibit an overall good potential for explaining the variability of regional seasonal precipitation. Moreover, the climate shift signals in the late 1970s over the eastern Pacific/North Pacific Oceans could also be reflected by both the variability of some circulation types and their correspondingly composite precipitations. This study extends our understandings for the large-scale atmospheric dynamics and their linkages with regional precipitation and is beneficial for the climate change projection and related adaptation activities in the highest and largest plateau in the world.</p>\n                ",

        "description": "\n\nThe equatorial Indian Ocean is characterized by strong eastward flows in the upper 80\u2013100 m during boreal spring and fall referred to as the Wyrtki jets. These jets are driven by westerly winds during the transition seasons between the southwest and northeast monsoons and represent a major conduit for mass and heat transfer between the eastern and western sides of the basin. Since their discovery over 40 years ago, there have been very few estimates from direct observations of the volume transports associated with these currents. In this paper we describe seasonal-to-interannual time scale variations in volume transports based on 5 years of unique measurements from an array of acoustic Doppler current profilers in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. The array was centered at 0\u00b0, 80.5\u00b0E and spanned latitudes between 2.5\u00b0N and 4\u00b0S from August 2008 to December 2013. Analysis of these data indicates that the spring jet peaks in May at 14.9\u00b12.9 Sv and the fall jet peaks in November at 19.7\u00b12.4 Sv, around which there are year-to-year transport variations of 5\u201310 Sv. The relationship of the interannual transport variations to zonal wind stress forcing, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and surface current variations associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are further highlighted. We also illustrate the role of wind-forced equatorial waves in affecting transport variations of the fall Wyrtki jet during the peak season of the IOD.\n",

During the warm season, observations and IPCC global climate models (GCMs) generally support a \u201cwet gets wetter, dry gets drier\u201d hypothesis in these regions, which acts to amplify the climatological transitions in the context of the annual cycle. In this study, we consider changes in U.S. early warm season precipitation in the observational record and regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by two \u201cwell performing\u201d dynamically downscaled CMIP3 models (HadCM3 and MPI ECHAM5) that have a robust climatological representation of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). Both observations and model results show amplification in historical seasonal transitions of temperature and precipitation associated with NAMS development, with WRF-MPI better representing the observed signal. Assuming the influence of remote Pacific sea surface temperature forcing (SST) associated with the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Variability (ENSO-PDV) on U.S. regional climate remains the same in the 21st century, similar extreme trends are also projected by WRF-MPI for the next 30 years. A methodology is also developed to objectively analyze how climate change may be synergistically interacting with ENSO-PDV variability during the early warm season.. Our analysis suggests that interannual variability of warm season temperature and precipitation associated with Pacific SST forcing is becoming more extreme and the signal is stronger in the observed record.\n",

This teleconnection pattern is characterized by a meridional dipole of anomalous circulation and precipitation between the tropical WNP and the midlatitudes. This study develops a long index of the PJ pattern using station-based atmospheric pressure data to track the PJ variability from 1897 to 2013. This index is correlated with a wide array of climate variables including air temperature, precipitation, Yangtze River flow, Japanese rice yield and the occurrence of tropical cyclones over the WNP (especially those that make landfall on the Chinese and Korean coast). For the recent three decades, the PJ index reproduces well-known correlations with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the preceding boreal winter and Indian Ocean temperature in the concurrent summer. For the 117-year period, this ENSO-PJ relationship varies on interdecadal time scales, with low correlations in the 1920s and from the 1940s to 1970s, and recurrences of significant correlations at the beginning of the 20th century and the 1930s. In accordance with the modulation, the magnitude and regional climate effect of the PJ variability have changed. These results highlight the importance of interdecadal modulations of climate anomalies in the summer WNP and the need of long-term observations to study such modulations.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau (TP) region experiences strong land-atmosphere interactions, and as an elevated heating source, significantly influences the formation of the Asian monsoon. Those interactions are not well represented in current land-surface models (LSM), partly due to difficulties in representing heterogeneities in soil structures in LSM. Simulations using the Noah-MP LSM are employed to assess the relative importance of parameterizing vertical soil heterogeneity, organic matter, and soil rhizosphere, and their impacts on seasonal evolution of soil temperature, soil moisture, and surface energy and water budgets at the sparsely vegetated Amdo site located in Central TP. The LSM spin-up time at the central TP depends on the complexity of the model physics, ranging from four years with simplest soil physics to 30 years with the addition of organic-matter and spare to dense rhizosphere parameterization in Noah-MP. Representing layered soil texture and organic matter does not improve low biases in topsoil moisture. Reducing the saturated conductivity from the mucilage in the rhizosphere produces better results. Surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are better simulated in the monsoon season as well. Adding layered soil texture and organic matter in Noah-MP retard the thawing in deep soil layers, and the rhizosphere effect delays thawing even more in the transient season. Uncertainties in soil initialization significantly affect deep-soil temperature and moisture, but uncertainties in atmospheric forcing conditions mainly affect topsoil variables and consequently the surface-energy fluxes. Differing land-surface physics cause 36% uncertainty in the accumulated evapotranspiration and subsurface runoff.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Zanzibar Channel lies between the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar Island in the tropical western Indian Ocean, is about 100 km long, 40 km wide, and 40 m deep, and is essential to local socioeconomic activities. This paper presents a model of the seasonal and tidal dynamics of the Zanzibar Channel based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and a comparison of the model and observations. The seasonal dynamics of the channel is forced by remote processes and the local wind. Remote forcing creates the East African Coastal Current, a portion of which flows through the channel northward with a seasonally varying magnitude. The local wind enhances this seasonality in the surface Ekman layer, resulting in a stronger northward flow during the southwest monsoon season and a weak northward or occasionally southward flow during the northeast monsoon season. The tidal flows converge and diverge in the center of the channel and reduce the transport in the channel. The remotely forced, wind-forced, and tidal dynamics contain 5%, 3%, and 92% of the total kinetic energy, respectively. Despite their low kinetic energy, the remotely forced and wind-forced flows are most relevant in advecting channel water to the open ocean, which occurs in 19 days at the peak of the southwest monsoon season. The channel is well mixed, except during brief periods in the two rainy seasons, and temporarily cools between December and February. The dispersion of passive tracers is presented as an example of potential model applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

        "description": "\nThe Sahelian Sudan is an arid to semiarid region that depends on the seasonal rainfall as the main source of water, but its rainfall has large interannual variability. Such dry regions usually have their main moisture sources elsewhere; thus, the rainfall variability is directly related to the moisture transport. This study seeks to identify source regions of water vapor for Sahelian Sudan during the monsoon period, from July to September. We have used the Lagrangian trajectory model FLEXPART driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis for the time period 1998 to 2008. The results show that most of the air masses that reach this region during the monsoon period have their major origins over the Arabian Peninsula, Central Africa, or are associated with the tropical easterly jet. Flow associated with Intertropical Convergence Zone contributes almost half of the total precipitated water; most of it comes from Central Africa. This suggests that moisture recycling is the major contributor, compared to Oceanic sources. The flows from the northeast (Arabian Peninsula and north Asia) and east (Horn of Africa and north Indian Ocean) contribute about one third of the precipitated water. The rest of precipitated water comes from the Mediterranean, subtropical Atlantic, and western Sahel, all with smaller contribution. Our results also indicate that different subregions of Sahelian Sudan have different moisture sources. Such result needs to be taken into account in seasonal forecasting practices.",

However, previous studies were limited by using proxies for convection or the bias of the tropopause data. Here the tropopause-penetrating convection is investigated based on the sole use of observational products from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar data and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC). The result shows that the frequency of precipitation-top heights above the monthly mean tropopause in the tropics is reduced logarithmically if the cold-point tropopause is adopted instead of the lapse-rate tropopause. Using the collocated COSMIC and precipitation radar observations, the tropopause-penetrating convection, i.e., the convection with the precipitation-top height above the lapse-rate tropopause, can be found over the summer monsoon regions and some continental regions. The averaged relative precipitation-top heights of tropopause-penetrating convective clusters are about 0.2\u20130.5\u2009km without significant land-ocean difference, while equivalent radii of clusters are 2.7\u20133.5\u2009km over land and 0.2\u20130.5\u2009km larger than those over ocean. These areal and vertical extents are smaller than those reported by previous studies. Furthermore, the collocated temperature profiles show that the tropopause-penetrating convection generates warming in the upper troposphere and cooling near the lapse-rate tropopause and in the lower stratosphere. Moreover, the tropopause-penetrating convection leads to a rapid (within 20\u2009min) lift of the lapse-rate tropopause by the adiabatic lofting within the convection (within a 10\u2009km radius).",

        "description": "\n\nOffshore-penetrating tongues of coastal water have been frequently observed during the downwelling-favorable monsoon season at specific locations in waters off the Min-Zhe Coast, a region influenced by a buoyant coastal current originating from the Changjiang River. This process plays an important role in cross-shelf material exchange in the East China Sea (ECS), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study suggests that the penetrating fronts are the response of buoyant coastal water to along-isobath undulation of the ambient pycnocline that is controlled by the temperature stratification in seawater. When the ambient pycnocline descends sharply in the downshelf direction, coastal water is transported offshore due to the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief (JEBAR), and thus generates a penetrating front. Along-isobath pycnocline undulation in the ECS can arise from nonuniform tidal mixing due to tidal wave divergence off the Min-Zhe Coast. Onshelf intrusion of cold and dense Kuroshio subsurface water prevents thorough mixing of the pycnocline. Different from the common cross-shelf transport phenomena induced by winds or frontal instabilities, such a tidal mechanism should produce penetrating fronts at specific locations, in agreement with observations.\n",

Transport paths are separated into two legs: \u201cconvective uplift\u201d (boundary layer to detrainment) and \u201cradiative ascent\u201d (detrainment to tropopause). The following three diagnostic measures are used: source location, source-to-tropopause transport time, and the source \u201cinfluence\u201d (i.e., the fraction of air with short transport times) at 100\u2009hPa. Ensemble means and standard deviations identify \u201crobust features\u201d (i.e., common to all ensemble members) while experimental hybrid calculations explain model-to-model discrepancies. Convective uplift is a major contributor to uncertainties in boundary layer-to-tropopause transport times and source locations. Spatial patterns of boundary layer influence at 100\u2009hPa are nevertheless robust. Detrainment-to-tropopause transport times are robust despite substantial model-to-model variations of convective detrainment height because ascent rates are faster at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Detrainment-to-tropopause transport also has robust horizontal spatial patterns for both convective sources and convective influence, particularly during boreal winter. Most model-to-model discrepancies occur at small spatial scales and are associated with differing distributions of convection. The location of maximum convective influence associated with the Asian summer monsoon is a notable exception. This exceptionally large discrepancy is associated primarily with radiative ascent. The fact that the observed maxima of important tropospheric constituents are collocated with the maximum convective influence for the diabatic calculations but not for the kinematic calculations suggests that diabatic trajectories could be more reliable in this region.",

In this study, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based high-resolution multisatellite rainfall products namely, TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-3B42 and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) are evaluated against recently released gauge-based India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data set. Both the research (delayed mode) and near real-time rainfall products of TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP (MVK and NRT) are evaluated over India at a daily scale for the peak southwest monsoon months of July\u2013August. Two study periods (2000\u20132010 and 2009\u20132013) are used to accommodate the analyses based on data availability. Comparison of TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP-MVK with IMD gauge-based data for 2000\u20132010 shows that these data sets are able to represent large-scale monsoon rainfall spatial features, but are having region-specific biases. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfall averaged over India is also reasonably captured. However in terms of biases, TMPA-3B42RT overestimates rainfall by about 21% and GSMaP-MVK underestimates by about 22% at all-India scale. In terms of continuous skill metrics, TMPA-3B42V7 is closer to the IMD gauge-based observations possibly due to gauge adjustments. Categorical verification against gauge-based observations shows that the satellite-based data sets have difficulties in rainfall detection primarily over the northern Jammu & Kashmir regions, northeast India, and southern peninsular India. At subregional scale within India, satellite rainfall estimates show rather lower skill score in rainfall identification and larger uncertainty in rainfall estimation over the northeast India. Comparison of near real-time products of TMPA and GSMaP for July\u2013August months of 2009\u20132013 shows that TMPA-3B42RT overestimates and GSMaP-NRT underestimates rainfall over most parts of India. Even though TMPA-3B42 (V7 and RT) and GSMaP-MVK rainfall data sets show similar diurnal variations over the Indian monsoon region, TMPA-3B42RT (GSMaP-MVK) shows larger (smaller) magnitude in diurnal cycle as compared to TMPA-3B42V7. Results from different skill metrics suggest that both research and near real-time versions of TMPA products can be used with relatively higher confidence as compared to GSMaP over the Indian region during peak monsoon period.\n",

Results show that GCMs reliably reproduce the geographical distribution of the variables considered. Compared with observations, however, most GCMs have topography-related cold biases (although these are smaller than those found in previous studies), excessive precipitation, an underestimated southeast\u2013northwest precipitation gradient, an overestimated magnitude and spatial variability of the interannual variability of temperature and precipitation, and an inadequate strength of the East Asian monsoon circulation. Pairwise comparison reveals that GCMs continue to improve from the TAR via the AR4 to the AR5 for temperature, but have little change for precipitation and the East Asian monsoon. The ability of GCMs varies with season and is affected to certain degree by their horizontal resolutions. Both the arithmetic mean and the median of multiple GCMs are little affected by filtering GCMs in terms of their ability, and the multi-model mean outperforms most of individual GCMs in every respect.\n",

Measurement of dissolved Al in coastal, shelf, and shelf break waters indicated decreasing concentrations with distance from the coast. However, the northward increase of dissolved Al in the upper 100 m along the shelf break transect, corresponding to the northward flow of Kuroshio Water along the Okinawa Trough from the north of Taiwan to the Tokara strait, indicates contributions of terrestrial material. The presence of an Al plume indicated cross-shelf transport at the subsurface at a potential density of 23.3\u201324.0 kg/m3. This plume originates from the near-bottom layer along the coast off Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, and first moves southeastward (to the north of Taiwan) and then northeastward (to shelf break with export at 29\u00b0N, 127\u00b0E). We calculated the cross-shelf fluxes of water and dissolved Al based on simulation results of the 3-D Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). The calculated cross-shelf fluxes of Al at the subsurface layer indicate that the ECS is highly efficient in pumping Al-rich coastal waters northward to the Japan Sea/East Sea and/or eastward into the western Pacific. We also identified an important role of the monsoon, with a change from northeasterly wind to southwesterly wind in spring, on the cross-shelf transport of Al by use of numerical tracer experiments.\n",

        "description": "\n\nPrecipitation, which is the most predominant component of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), may have large uncertainties among reanalysis datasets. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of five reanalysis datasets in reproducing the EASM precipitation. These datasets are NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project (NCEP1), NCEP-U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Model Intercomparison ProjectIIreanalysis (NCEP2), Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis Project (JRA-25), Interim ECMWF Re-analysis (ERA-Interim), and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). Results show that the five reanalysis datasets can generally reproduce the climatology and interannual variability of EASM precipitation. Especially, the MERRA and ERA-Interim have the highest skills. Considering different-class precipitation, large uncertainties exist in the category of non-rainfall and heavy rainfall. The five reanalysis datasets overestimate the non-rainfall frequency, and the JRA25 and NCEP2 overestimate the heavy rainfall frequency. The well-known inter-decadal variation around mid-1990s can also be better depicted by ERA-Interim and MERRA. For linear trend of precipitation, only the MERRA can reasonably reproduce the increasing tendency over southern China and western Pacific and the decreasing tendency over Indo-China Peninsula. Based on the EOF analysis, the spatial-temporal structure of EASM precipitation has been examined. The MERRA, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim can better capture both the spatial patterns and principle components of first two EOF modes. Based on our evaluation, the preferential reanalysis datasets for investigating the EASM precipitation are the ERA-Interim and MERRA, which also permit the more precise investigations of interannual to decadal variability.\n",

With relatively few validation studies over the Eastern Himalayan region, this study examined seasonal and interannual skills of four gridded precipitation products including the regional gauge-based APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources) and three near-global satellite-based products: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) MORPHing (CMORPH), and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRP) using in-situ rain gauge data from Bhutan for the period 1998\u20132012. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the dominant rainfall patterns over Bhutan. An attempt has also been made to correct precipitation biases in the satellite-only products using a gamma (\u03b3)-based distribution approach. Results indicated that APHRODITE and satellite-based precipitation products were able to adequately capture the spatio-temporal patterns of rainfall variability over Bhutan. Extreme precipitation events and extreme drought periods were well captured with very good correlations (>0.5). APHRODITE and TRMM 3B43v7 were remarkably similar, whereas satellite-only products (CMORPH and CHIRP) highly underestimated (20\u201360% or 200\u2013450 mm month\u22121) monsoon rainfall over Bhutan. While TRMM 3B43v7 still underestimated monsoon rainfall (by \u223c25%), it has significantly improved the seasonal bias (by 20\u201340%) from its previous version (TRMM 3B43v6). CHIRP performed relatively better in the high rainfall regions but indicated very low correlations over mountainous regions and during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The bias correction approach indicated best results for TRMM 3B43v6 (up to 33%) in the Southern Foothills, whereas satellite-only products improved only moderately (5\u201320%).\n",

        "description": "\n\nWeather and climate model simulations of the West African Monsoon (WAM) have generally poor representation of the rainfall distribution and monsoon circulation because key processes, such as clouds and convection, are poorly characterized. The vertical distribution of cloud and precipitation during the WAM are evaluated in Met Office Unified Model simulations against CloudSat observations. Simulations were run at 40-km and 12-km horizontal grid length using a convection parameterization scheme and at 12-km, 4-km, and 1.5-km grid length with the convection scheme effectively switched off, to study the impact of model resolution and convection parameterization scheme on the organisation of tropical convection. Radar reflectivity is forward-modelled from the model cloud fields using the CloudSat simulator to present a like-with-like comparison with the CloudSat radar observations. The representation of cloud and precipitation at 12-km horizontal grid length improves dramatically when the convection parameterization is switched off, primarily because of a reduction in daytime (moist) convection. Further improvement is obtained when reducing model grid length to 4 km or 1.5 km, especially in the representation of thin anvil and mid-level cloud, but three issues remain in all model configurations. Firstly, all simulations underestimate the fraction of anvils with cloud top height above 12 km, which can be attributed to too low ice water contents in the model compared to satellite retrievals. Secondly, the model consistently detrains mid-level cloud too close to the freezing level, compared to higher altitudes in CloudSat observations. Finally, there is too much low-level cloud cover in all simulations and this bias was not improved when adjusting the rainfall parameters in the microphysics scheme. To improve model simulations of the WAM, more detailed and in-situ observations of the dynamics and microphysics targeting these non-precipitating cloud types are required.\n",

J. Burns, L. C. Kanner, H. Cheng, and R. Lawrence Edwards<br /><br />Relatively few marine or terrestrial paleoclimate studies have focused on\nglacial inception, the transition from an interglacial to a glacial climate\nstate. As a result, neither the timing and structure of glacial inception nor the spatial pattern of glacial inception in different parts of\nthe world is well known. Here we present results of a study of a speleothem from the\nPeruvian Andes that records changes in the intensity of South American Summer\nMonsoon (SASM) rainfall over the period from 125 to 115 ka. The results show\nthat late in the last interglacial period, at 123 ka, SASM rainfall\ndecreased, perhaps in response to a decrease in temperature and ice cover in\nthe high northern latitudes and associated changes in atmospheric\ncirculation. Then at 120.8 ka, a rapid increase in SASM rainfall marks the\nend of the last interglacial. After a more gradual increase between 120 and\n117 ka, a second abrupt increase occurs at 117 ka. This pattern of change\nis mirrored to a remarkable degree by changes in the East Asian Monsoon. It\nis interpreted to reflect both a long-term gradual response of the monsoons\nto orbitally driven insolation changes and to rapid changes in Northern\nHemisphere ice volume and temperature. Both monsoon systems are close to\ntheir full glacial conditions by 117 ka, before any significant decrease in\natmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.",

The ASWI is significantly correlated with the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel in the 1900\u20132013 period (r\u2009=\u2009+0.57, r\u2009=\u2009+0.66 and r\u2009=\u2009+0.53 for July, August and September respectively). By using historical wind direction measurements it has been possible to compute the ASWI back to 1790 for July and to 1839 for August and September, thus providing the first instrumental record of the West African Monsoon strength for a large portion of the 19th century.\nSince the 1970s, the Sahel has experienced a strong and persistent drought. During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel. Notwithstanding, two of the few dry years within this period were concurrent with large volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere. This latter result supports the recently described relationship between major volcanic eruptions and the occurrence of isolated drought episodes in the Sahel.\n",

The simulated spatial pattern of annual mean precipitation amount improves significantly with increased resolution. The low-resolution model is inadequate to reproduce the precipitation closely associated with fine-scale orographic forcing, such as the narrow large-rainfall belt along the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The distribution of rainfall over and around the elevation of the Tibetan Plateau and high-altitude mountains becomes more realistic at higher resolutions. The proportion of the large-bias (small-bias) area continuously reduces (increases) when moving from T42 to T266 resolution. Simulations at all three resolutions can capture the key features of the major seasonal variation of rainfall arising from the onset and advancement of the Asian monsoon. A novel method is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the simulated intensity-frequency structure to the horizontal resolution. The proportion of light rain, which demonstrates large positive bias in climate models, decreases dramatically at higher resolution. The intensity-frequency structures averaged over steep-terrain regions and plain areas become more distinctive and realistic as the resolution increases.\n",

        "description": "\n\nCyclonic storms associated with the midlatitude Subtropical Westerly Jet (SWJ), referred to as Western Disturbances (WDs), play a critical role in the meteorology of the Indian subcontinent. WDs embedded in the southward propagating SWJ produce extreme precipitation over northern India and are further enhanced over the Himalayas due to orographic land-atmosphere interactions. During December, January, and February, WD snowfall is the dominant precipitation input to establish and sustain regional snowpack, replenishing regional water resources. Spring melt is the major source of runoff to northern Indian rivers and can be linked to important hydrologic processes from aquifer recharge to flashfloods. Understanding the dynamical structure, evolution-decay, and interaction of WDs with the Himalayas is therefore necessary to improve knowledge which has wide ranging socioeconomic implications beyond short-term disaster response including cold season agricultural activities, management of water resources, and development of vulnerability-adaptive measures. In addition, WD wintertime precipitation provides critical mass input to existing glaciers and modulates the albedo characteristics of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, affecting large-scale circulation and the onset of the succeeding Indian Summer Monsoon. Assessing the impacts of climate variability and change on the Indian subcontinent requires fundamental understanding of the dynamics of WDs. In particular, projected changes in the structure of the SWJ will influence evolution-decay processes of the WDs and impact Himalayan regional water availability. This review synthesizes past research on WDs with a perspective to provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of knowledge to assist both researchers and policymakers, and context for future research.\n",

        "description": "\nBased on extensive analysis of observations and a series of climate model experiments, here we establish that slow variations of northern hemispheric extratropical sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies can augment seasonal predictability of the south Asian monsoon. The SST conditions and performance of the south Asian monsoon during 2013 boreal summer months (June\u2013September) led us to hypothesize that the strong extratropical SST anomalies in the North Pacific and North Atlantic in conjunction with weak tropical SST anomalies (weak La Ni\u00f1a) were responsible for the above-normal rainfall over India during 2013. We also argue that the 2013 SST pattern and above-normal monsoon condition are not unique but occurred on several occasions in the past. Further, we show that there is a complementary pattern of strong extratropical SST and weak tropical SST that is associated with below-normal south Asian monsoon rainfall. We also show that the extratropical SST pattern in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with a low-frequency interdecadal mode of variability indicating potential predictability associated with such extratropical SST forcing. Extensive experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced by such SST conditions elucidate the mechanism through which the extratropical SSTs influence the Indian monsoon. The SST anomalies affect the north\u2013south temperature gradient and lead to a local displacement of the jet stream, setting up a quasi-stationary wave. Such a stationary wave, in turn, affects the tropospheric temperature (TT) over southern Eurasia, influencing the north\u2013south TT gradient in the region and thereby the Indian monsoon. Our discovery of this additional source of potential predictability together with the fact that the new-generation coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models are capable of predicting the extratropical SST anomalies brightens the prospect of south Asian monsoon prediction.\n",

Data were collected during the whole year 2006 in the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) campain. Two seasonal periods are considered: the dry season, when the northeasterly Harmattan is flowing at low tropospheric level, and the wet season, associated with the southwesterly monsoon circulation. The fine vertical structure of temperature, convective air stability and water vapour for each seasonal period is described in detail and differences are emphasized. Typical temporal series and monthly averaged diurnal cycles are presented. It is shown that a diurnal cycle of water vapour is present throughout the year, including the dry season. The diurnal cycle of water vapour is controlled mainly by the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). During the dry season, the diurnal cycle of water vapour is organized into two layers: a lower layer (LL) from the surface up to 0.6\u20131.4 km\u00a0above ground level (agl) and an upper layer (UL) from 1.4 up to 5\u20136 km\u00a0agl. The water vapour distributions in the LL and UL are anticorrelated, with a half-day temporal shift. As a result, the vertically integrated water vapour (IWV), which displays a quasi-sinusoidal diurnal cycle when computed separately for the LL and UL, appears almost flat for the total tropospheric height, due to the half-day period shift. This structure of two layers is not observed during the wet season. Probability density functions (pdfs) of water vapour content are presented. In dry conditions, the pdfs are well fitted by a log-normal distribution, while the Weibull distribution fits the pdfs for wet conditions better.\n",

The multiple passive tracer method is successfully applied to determine the origin regions of the Atlantic cold tongue (ACT), using 31 passive tracers. At the time of the ACT minimum in sea surface temperature, 38 \u00b1 3% of the surface water in the central equatorial Atlantic is found to originate in the western side of the basin, with only 11 \u00b1 2% originating in the east. Conversely, for the ACT surface cooling off the west coast of Africa, only 2 \u00b1 1% is from the west of the Atlantic basin, with 71 \u00b1 7% from the east. The region of the North Brazil undercurrent is found to be the most important origin region for the central Atlantic ACT region, for a 6\u20138 month lead time. Using the Met Office EN4 observational dataset of ocean temperatures, correlations are found between January temperatures in the North Brazil undercurrent region and both the ACT mean temperature and ACT spatial extent in July\u2013August, significant at the 0.95 level. This suggests that the 6-month lead-time predictability of the ACT may be increased by improved knowledge of the North Brazil undercurrent temperature. Results from previous studies suggest that such increased predictability of the ACT could potentially help improve predictions of the West African monsoon.\n",

        "description": "\nThree months of profiler observations from Darwin, Australia are separated into seven cloud types (shallow, mid-level, and deep convective; weak and robust stratiform rain; and transitional and ice-only anvil) to provide vertical velocity statistics on the full spectrum of tropical convective clouds over the course of a monsoon season. Consistent with past studies, convective updraughts increase in height and magnitude as the convective cloud height increases. Shallow/mid-level/deep convection has a mean maximum value of 0.3 m s\u22121 at 3 km/0.6 m s\u22121 at 5 km/2.5 m s\u22121 at 8 km. Deep convective extremes approach 18 m s\u22121 above 8 km while downdraughts in all convective cloud types are maximum below 4 km. Stratiform vertical velocities are weaker and less varied than in active convection, with maximum mean values <0.25 m s\u22121. However, stratiform rain regions associated with larger near-surface reflectivities (and thus rain rates) have stronger mesoscale up- and downdraughts than weaker stratiform rain regions. Anvil cloud with little or no rain near the surface also exhibits mesoscale up- and downdraughts, but the vertical velocity profile is shifted up in height by at least 2 km. In addition, anvil updraughts were only 20\u201350% of the magnitudes in the stratiform rain region. Overall, the vertical motion statistics were similar across the pre-, active and suppressed monsoon periods. The vertical velocity distributions for each cloud type were also generally consistent with the reflectivity distributions (i.e. the strongest updraughts were often linked to the largest reflectivities), allowing for some linkages between the dynamical and microphysical cloud properties. For example, strong updraughts above the 0 \u00b0C level in deep convection are associated with strongly sloping reflectivity profiles supporting the importance of cold rain growth processes, and stronger vertical motions are associated with stratiform rain that has a robust bright band.\n",

Sea-surface temperature (SST) is the only oceanographic parameter applied in most of the monsoon forecasting models, which many times do not represent the heat energy available to the atmosphere. We studied the impacts of ocean mean temperature (OMT), representing the heat energy of the upper ocean, and SST on the all India summer monsoon rainfall through a statistical relation during 1993\u20132013 and found that OMT has a better link than SST.\n",

Using 4 years of multi-satellite data analysis, we show that CCF varies with aerosol composition and changed from 0.28 to 0.13 from postmonsoon to winter as a result of shift from less absorbing to moderately absorbing aerosol. Our results indicate that we can estimate aerosol absorption from space using independently measured top of the atmosphere (TOA) fluxes [Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization-Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CALIPSO-MODIS-CERES)] combined algorithms for example.\n",

The relationship between AM and the first EAWM mode remained stable during 1958\u20132013, whereas that between SPV and the second EAWM mode increased suddenly since the late 1980s. The SPV-related circulation and planetary wave activities are intensified in the latter period. We suggested that this change might be caused by the global warming and ozone depletion.\n",

The strength of coupling varies geographically over different monsoon phases. The coupling strength over the entire monsoon period is primarily attributed to the monsoon mature phase with strong signal of coupling in the eastern NAM region.

        "description": "\n\nThe Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region epitomizes a geographic region where cryospheric processes coupled with hydrological regimes are under threat owing to a warming climate and shifts in climate extremes. In this study, we analyse global climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) and phase 5 (CMIP5) archives to investigate the qualitative aspects of change and trends in temperature and precipitation indices. Specifically, we examine and evaluate multi-model, multi-scenario climate change projections and seven extreme temperature and precipitation indices over the eastern Himalaya (EH) and western Himalaya-Karakoram (WH) regions for the 21st century. Density distribution plots of observed climate indices for meteorological stations and gridded indices are also analysed, which indicate significant negative trends in the annual number of frost days and significant increasing trends in warm nights in the EH region over the 1960\u20132000 period. Multi-model average (MMA) projections additionally indicate continued trends towards more extreme conditions consistent with a warmer, wetter climate. Precipitation projections indicate increased mean precipitation with more frequent extreme rainfall during monsoon season in the EH region, and a wetter cold season in the WH region. Time series of all MMA precipitation indices exhibit significant increasing trends over the 1901\u20132099 period. By comparison, time series of temperature indices show decreases in the intra-annual extreme temperature range and total number of frost days, as well as increases in warm nights. In general, these future projections point towards increases in summertime temperatures and modifications in precipitation across both regions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe improvements in representing the Indian summer monsoon features are assessed using the latest coupled global reanalysis, the climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) from National Centre for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) with respect to widely used NCEP-reanalysis 2 (NCEP2). To validate the reanalysis product corresponding observations are also used. CFSR is more realistic in terms of spatial pattern of seasonal mean rainfall, first and second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of interannual variability as compared with NCEP2 reanalysis. Percentage of total variance was explained by northward and westward propagating intraseasonal oscillation modes in CFSR that are better captured than those from NCEP2 reanalysis. Northward propagating mode is well depicted in CFSR as compared with that of NCEP2 and may be attributed to the strong vertical shear of zonal wind and strong meridional gradient of specific humidity in CFSR. Distribution of the north\u2013south and east\u2013west spectra of CFSR suggests much better conformity with observation as compared with NCEP2. Surface wind patterns of CFSR are having relatively small errors compared to Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds. CFSR has some success in simulating observed sea surface temperature (SST)\u2013rainfall relationship as well as in depicting the coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena of El Ni\u00f1o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in terms of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) teleconnections. Overall monsoon features in CFSR are much closer to the observation as compared with NCEP2, and these may be because of the realistic representation of ocean\u2013atmosphere feedback owing to the coupled model-based reanalysis. This study will help in establishing the credibility of the CFSR in terms of realistic representation of Indian summer monsoon as compared with widely used atmospheric only reanalysis.\n",

        "description": "\n\nPrevious research highlights the dominant role of Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and their associated large-scale teleconnections in modulating the North American monsoon (NAM). At the regional scale, feedbacks associated with land-surface boundary conditions have been shown to provide \u2018memory\u2019 in the system. Here, a previously unexplored second-order linkage between aerosol generated by late-spring wildfires and subsequent summer precipitation delivered by the NAM in the Arizona-New Mexico (AZNM) region is proposed. Correlations between June/July organic carbon and elemental carbon (OC/EC) in Inter-agency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) aerosol data (Gila Wilderness and Bandelier) and NAM precipitation in southern AZNM over the period 1994\u20132012 are shown to be negative (r\u2009=\u2009\u20130.4), suggesting that active antecedent wildfire seasons tend to be immediately followed by a weak late summer monsoon. This result is consistent with a previous study linking precipitation and area burned in wildfires in AZNM. A survey of extant literature suggests a sound basis for potential mechanisms related to convective processes and cloud microphysics, and furthermore suggests that this forcing could be of similar magnitude to well-documented land-based second-order NAM forcings (antecedent snowpack and soil moisture, vegetation, and mineral dust). Based on these results, we believe that the role of aerosols in modulating summer precipitation deserves further investigation both observationally and in modeling studies. If indeed wildfire smoke does contribute to the modulation of NAM intensity, by virtue of its close temporal association with NAM season, it may well represent a factor that could contribute effectively to improved seasonal prediction of summer precipitation in the NAM region.\n",

Eleven-member forecasts were made at every 5-day interval during the June\u2013September monsoon season which included monsoon onset and withdrawal phases. The ensemble members were created by perturbing the initial conditions at each start time. In addition to the CFSv2 forecasts, we also carried out forecasts using the atmospheric-only component (GFSv2) forced with CFSv2-derived sea surface temperature (SST) subjected to a bias correction based on historical observations (GFSbc runs).\nBoth the CFSv2 and GFSbc runs were able to predict the progression of ISM over the Indian region and the subsequent intraseasonal oscillations (active and break phases). The analysis for an extreme event (Uttarakhand flood) and monsoon revival (MR) towards the end of the season was also performed. Comparison between the two runs shows that active and break spells were predicted with good fidelity over the Indian region, though GFSbc outperforms CFSv2 on several occasions. Thus, improvement of the operational monsoon forecast over Indian region using NCEP CFSv2 requires better representation of air\u2013sea interaction and mean states of ocean.\n",
