Nine &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m oscillations in water level were documented between ca. 15 and 4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka. The earliest lake level oscillation between ca. 14.5 and 13<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka is not well constrained with water level to at least 70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the present surface and subsequently fell to at least 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. Lake level increased to at least 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, post Younger Dryas cooling. Water level fell by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m by 10.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, with another potential rise at ca. 8.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka to &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above current level. Lake level regressed by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m at 8.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka coincident with cooling in the equatorial eastern Atlantic Ocean. Two major &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m lake level oscillations centered at 6.6 and 5.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka may reflect enhanced convection with warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. The termination of the African Humid Period occurred from ca. 8.0 to 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and is characterized by highly variable lake level (\u00b1&amp;gt;40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m), rather than one monotonic fall in water level. This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana. Also, for this closed lake basin excesses and deficits in water input are amplified with a cascading lake effect in the East African Rift Valley and through the Chew Bahir Basin. The final regression from a high stand of &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the present lake began at 5.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and water level was below 20<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m by 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka; and for the remainder of the Holocene. This sustained low stand is associated with weakening of the West African Monsoon, a shift of the mean position of Congo Air Boundary west of the Lake Turkana catchment and with meter-scale variability in lake level linked to Walker circulation across the Indian Ocean.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921818115001265-fx1.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"390\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

To more effectively interpret and synthesize key regional records, we reanalysed the data from 13 pollen sequences from the summer rainfall zone of South Africa spanning the last 45,000 years, obtaining directly comparable quantitative reconstructions of mean annual temperature and summer rainfall. Temperature reconstructions from across the region provide consistent results, with all sites reflecting trends observed in southwest Indian Ocean sea-surface temperatures in the adjacent Mozambique Channel. Precipitation reconstructions are more heterogeneous, with two distinct subregions being identified. In the northeast, long-term trends in precipitation are determined by sea-surface and continental temperature trends, revealing a positive relationship between temperature and rainfall. This long-term pattern appears to be primarily driven by high northern latitude mechanisms, with direct local insolation being subordinate. Their relative impact reversed during terminal glacial period/early Holocene, at which time direct insolation forcing became the main driver of rainfall variability. Further south, in central South Africa, precipitation variability appears also to be influenced by the latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, which combine with tropical flow to create tropical-temperate trough, advecting moisture into the interior. In this region, periods of maximum precipitation coincide with periods of elevated SSTs and equatorward expansions of the westerly storm track.

All chemical and physical controls on sediment petrography, mineralogy and geochemistry, including weathering, grain-size, hydraulic sorting, mechanical breakdown, anthropic impact, mixing and recycling are investigated in detail. The Nile course is controlled along its entire length by the East African\u2013Red Sea Rift. In this anorogenic setting, detritus is derived in various proportions from volcanic fields associated with tectonic extension (Anorogenic Volcanic provenance) and from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks uplifted on the rift shoulders or exposed on the craton (Continental Block provenance). The entire spectrum of such detrital signatures is displayed in the Nile catchment. Volcaniclastic Atbara sand is generated by focused erosion of the Ethiopian basaltic plateau in semiarid climate, whereas quartzose White Nile sand reflects low erosion rates, extensive weathering and sediment trapping in lakes and swamps at equatorial to subequatorial latitudes. In the main Nile, as in its main tributary the Blue Nile, suspended load is volcaniclastic, whereas feldspatho-quartzose bedload is derived largely from basement sources, with fine to medium-grained eolian sand added along the lower course. Mixing of detrital populations with different provenance and grain size is reflected in diverse violations of settling-equivalence relationships in fluvial and deltaic sediments. Sediment delivery from Sudan has been cut off after closure of the Aswan High Dam and accelerated erosion of deltaic cusps is leading to local formation of placer lags dominated by ultradense Fe\u2013Ti\u2013Cr oxides, but mineralogical changes caused by man's radical modification of fluvial regimes have been minor so far. In beaches of Sinai, Gaza and Israel, the Nile volcaniclastic trace gets progressively diluted by quartzose sand recycled from eolian coastal deposits and carbonaticlastic detritus eroded from the Levant rift shoulder. Studying the compositional variability of modern sediments in big-river systems allows us to appreciate the richness of natural processes occurring in the vast drainage basin, and provides us with a key to understand the information stored in sedimentary archives and to reconstruct the evolution of the Earth's surface from the recent to the less recent past.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

        "description": "\n\nThe Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is a natural climate mode of variability whose discovery can be traced back at least as far as the beginning of the 20th century, before human activities produced enough gases to noticeably change the climate. However, recent observed changes in the SAM are linked to increases of greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion, hence assigning SAM's alterations, in large part, to human activities. In this study, the 20th century reanalysis data were used to establish the SAM's prominent shifts during the years 1917, 1961 and 1997. The first shift coincides with abrupt greenhouse gas increases and the latter shifts are attributed to stratospheric ozone level changes. The East Africa \u2018Short Rains\u2019 (EASR) index derived from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, demonstrates coinciding shifts with the SAM index. However, the SAM's influence on EASR appears to be achieved through a meridional dipole that is formed in the sea-level pressure of the Indian Ocean basin, with one pole over the Tropics and the other over the extratropics. When this dipole pattern is weakly developed as the period between 1961 and 1997, the SAM is decoupled from the EASR and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) demonstrates a dominant role in modulating the EASR. The SAM is also linked to the IOD through its control of the Mascarene High variability, hence connecting the SAM to the dominant circulation variability in the Indian Ocean. Although the El Nino Southern Oscillation is strongly correlated to EASR, it is not related to the epochal variability in the rainfall. Therefore, the slow modulation in EASR is linked to the SAM whose shifts are triggered by gases emanating from human influences.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Zanzibar Channel lies between the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar Island in the tropical western Indian Ocean, is about 100 km long, 40 km wide, and 40 m deep, and is essential to local socioeconomic activities. This paper presents a model of the seasonal and tidal dynamics of the Zanzibar Channel based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and a comparison of the model and observations. The seasonal dynamics of the channel is forced by remote processes and the local wind. Remote forcing creates the East African Coastal Current, a portion of which flows through the channel northward with a seasonally varying magnitude. The local wind enhances this seasonality in the surface Ekman layer, resulting in a stronger northward flow during the southwest monsoon season and a weak northward or occasionally southward flow during the northeast monsoon season. The tidal flows converge and diverge in the center of the channel and reduce the transport in the channel. The remotely forced, wind-forced, and tidal dynamics contain 5%, 3%, and 92% of the total kinetic energy, respectively. Despite their low kinetic energy, the remotely forced and wind-forced flows are most relevant in advecting channel water to the open ocean, which occurs in 19 days at the peak of the southwest monsoon season. The channel is well mixed, except during brief periods in the two rainy seasons, and temporarily cools between December and February. The dispersion of passive tracers is presented as an example of potential model applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

Zonneveld<br /><br />In tropical eastern Africa, vegetation distribution is largely controlled by\nregional hydrology, which has varied over the past 20 000 years. Therefore,\naccurate reconstructions of past vegetation and hydrological changes are\ncrucial for a better understanding of climate variability in the tropical\nsoutheastern African region. We present high-resolution pollen records from\na marine sediment core recovered offshore of the Rufiji River delta. Our data\ndocument significant shifts in pollen assemblages during the last\ndeglaciation, identifying, through changes in both upland and\nlowland vegetation, specific responses of plant communities to atmospheric\n(precipitation) and coastal (coastal dynamics and sea-level changes)\nalterations. Specifically, arid conditions reflected by a maximum pollen\nrepresentation of dry and open vegetation occurred during the Northern\nHemisphere cold Heinrich event 1 (H1), suggesting that the expansion of drier\nupland vegetation was synchronous with cold Northern Hemisphere\nconditions. This arid period is followed by an interval in which forest and\nhumid woodlands expanded, indicating a hydrologic shift towards more humid\nconditions. Droughts during H1 and the shift to humid conditions around 14.8 kyr BP in the uplands are consistent with latitudinal shifts of the\nintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude Northern\nHemisphere climatic fluctuations. Additionally, our results show that the\nlowland vegetation, consisting of well-developed salt marshes and mangroves\nin a successional pattern typical for vegetation occurring in intertidal\nhabitats, has responded mainly to local coastal dynamics related to marine\ninundation frequencies and soil salinity in the Rufiji Delta as well as to the\nlocal moisture availability. Lowland vegetation shows a substantial\nexpansion of mangrove trees after ~ 14.8 kyr BP, suggesting an\nincreased moisture availability and river runoff in the coastal area. The\nresults of this study highlight the decoupled climatic and environmental\nprocesses to which the vegetation in the uplands and the Rufiji Delta has\nresponded during the last deglaciation.",

This study compares several forecasting methods using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to predict East African rains with various lead times. It is shown that the forecasts can explain more than 50% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The forecasts also explain more than 50% of the long rains (boreal spring) over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40% of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010\u20132011 forecasts for both the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.\n",
