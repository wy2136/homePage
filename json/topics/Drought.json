S. Weng, D. H. Yan, H. Wang, J. H. Liu, Z. Y. Yang, T. L. Qin, and J. Yin<br /><br />Drought is firstly a resource issue, and with its development it evolves\ninto a disaster issue. Drought events usually occur in a determinate but a\nrandom manner. Drought has become one of the major factors to affect\nsustainable socioeconomic development. In this paper, we propose the\ngeneralized drought assessment index (GDAI) based on water resources systems\nfor assessing drought events. The GDAI considers water supply and water\ndemand using a distributed hydrological model. We demonstrate the use of the\nproposed index in the Dongliao River basin in northeastern China. The\nresults simulated by the GDAI are compared to observed drought disaster\nrecords in the Dongliao River basin. In addition, the temporal distribution of\ndrought events and the spatial distribution of drought frequency from the\nGDAI are compared with the traditional approaches in general (i.e., standard\nprecipitation index, Palmer drought severity index and rate of water deficit\nindex). Then, generalized drought times, generalized drought duration, and\ngeneralized drought severity were calculated by theory of runs. Application\nof said runs at various drought levels (i.e., mild drought, moderate drought,\nsevere drought, and extreme drought) during the period 1960\u20132010 shows that\nthe centers of gravity of them all distribute in the middle reaches of\nDongliao River basin, and change with time. The proposed methodology may\nhelp water managers in water-stressed regions to quantify the impact of\ndrought, and consequently, to make decisions for coping with drought.",

Predicting current and future levels of plant drought stress is important not only at the local scale, but also at larger, landscape to regional, scales, because these are the management scales at which adaptation and mitigation strategies are implemented. To obtain reliable predictions of soil moisture and plant drought stress over large extents, water balance models need to be complemented with detailed information about the spatial variation of vegetation and soil attributes. We designed, calibrated and validated a water balance model that produces annual estimates of drought intensity and duration for all plant cohorts in a forest stand. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as a case study, we coupled this model with plot records from two Spanish forest inventories in which species identity, diameter and height of plant cohorts were available. Leaf area index of each plant cohort was estimated from basal area using species-specific relationships. Vertical root distribution for each species in each forest plot was estimated by determining the distribution that maximized transpiration in the model, given average climatic conditions, soil attributes and stand density. We determined recent trends (period 1980\u20132010) in drought stress for the main tree species in Catalonia; where forest growth and densification occurs in many areas as a result of rural abandonment and decrease of forest management. Regional increases in drought stress were detected for most tree species, although we found high variation in stress changes among individual forest plots. Moreover, predicted trends in tree drought stress were mainly due to changes in leaf area occurred between the two forest inventories rather than to climatic trends. We conclude that forest structure needs to be explicitly considered in assessments of plant drought stress patterns and trends over large geographic areas, and that forest inventories are useful sources of data provided that reasonably good estimates of soil attributes and root distribution are available. Our approach coupled with recent improvements in forest survey technologies may allow obtaining spatially continuous and precise assessments of drought stress. Further efforts are needed to calibrate drought-related demographic processes before water balance and drought stress estimates can be fully used for the accurate prediction of drought impacts.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

These processes will result in changes in the local carbon, water, and energy balances. Two closely located eddy covariance towers on native prairie sites in Kansas with differing burn regimes provided a unique opportunity to investigate those changes with minimal confounding climate factors. Daytime turbulent fluxes were analyzed throughout the growing season during two wet years (2008, 2009) and one drought year (2011). The site experiencing more woody encroachment (K4B) was a greater carbon sink every year, especially in 2011, when the annually burned site (KON) became a negligible sink and potential source of carbon. K4B also had greater seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) at all times except during drought and when burned. Evidence of water loss from deeper, stored sources was shown at K4B through cumulative evaporative loss that exceeded precipitation during drought conditions. Changes in the nature of the turbulent fluxes were also investigated through deviations from similarity theory, quadrant analysis, and wavelet decomposition. Wavelet analysis determined the size of eddies primarily involved in net exchange, showing differences between sites across small to medium scales (average diameter of 4.0\u2013108<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m). Increased surface heterogeneity and roughness with woody encroachment was seen through smaller eddy size of maximum transport and slightly weakened applicability of similarity theory at K4B. Eddy size decreased over the course of the growing season, in a strikingly inverse relation to grass leaf area index, likely corresponding to greater canopy height and roughness. Variance of the correlation between carbon and water, indicative of more variable plant productivity, is much greater across all scales in 2011 at KON only. Overall, results indicate woody encroachment increases resilience to drought. Though carbon sequestration remains stronger at the woody encroachment site, it comes at the cost of far increased water loss, including from deeper groundwater resources, which could prove detrimental in combination with predicted climate change.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The study was carried out over four years (2010\u20132013) corresponding to the first two rotations of the plantation.

Therefore, the peninsula is particularly sensitive to climate change owing to frequent periods of precipitation deficit together with societal dependence on water. In this study, we address meteorological droughts of the peninsula between 1901 and 2010, using the Global Precipitation Climatology Center database. First, we carried out a statistical classification of the peninsula according to annual precipitation cycle. The spatiotemporal variability of droughts was evaluated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) by determining the evolution of areas affected by severe and extreme drought. Subsequently, we calculated the overall trend of precipitation and anomalies to investigate whether an observed drought increase is attributable to a decrease of precipitation or an increase of precipitation extremes. Finally, we examined periodicities of precipitation anomalies via wavelet analysis, relating these to large-scale modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results show an increase in the area affected by severe and extreme drought, particularly on Atlantic-facing slopes. The mainland areas have longer and more intense periods of drought, with an average SPI of \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>0.52 and 4-month duration. Over the 110<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years analyzed, we observed weak trends of annual precipitation in the extreme northwest and southern IP. However, in the last decades of the series, long periods of strong negative anomalies are seen, interspersed with years of strong positive anomalies, suggesting an increase in precipitation pattern extremes. Finally, the relationship between the NAO index and precipitation anomalies on the Atlantic seaboard is highlighted. Thus, in both series we found a 5\u20136-year periodicity in their first years, with a diminishing cycle period reaching a periodicity of 2\u20133<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years in the final years.

In this study, we systematically analyzed the changes in the mean and extreme values for temperature and precipitation over the Loess Plateau between 1961 and 2011, using a gridded dataset with high-density gauge data. Statistically significant positive trends (<italic>p</italic> <hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>&amp;lt;<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.05) in the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature values (TM, TX, and TN) were identified in almost all regions. Warming rates increased from the southeast to the northwest of the Loess Plateau for both TM and TN; however, for TX, the greatest warming increases were observed in the southeast region. We also found general decreases in the diurnal temperature range and the number of cold nights and cold days, and increases in the length of the growing season and the number of warm days and warm nights. Moreover, relatively intense changes occurred in the high percentile ranges for both TX and TN. The total amount of precipitation on wet days decreased over a large area of the Loess Plateau, particularly in the southeast region. The inequality in the spread of precipitation over the year (temporal inequality) increased extensively over the past fifty years in the wet region. Approximately 37.60% of the total area with a reduced amount of precipitation had concurrent decreases in both the frequency and intensity of rainfall. However, approximately 37.20% of the area with a reduced amount of precipitation had decreases in the frequency but increases in the intensity of rainfall. The proportion of days with light or moderate precipitation was decreased in the wet region which mainly located in the southwest of the Loess Plateau, but there were only minor changes in extreme precipitation events. Overall, when both temperature and precipitation changes were combined, we observed that the southwest of the Loess Plateau has undergone the largest degree of climate change. Consequently, both the ecological environment and local agriculture on the Loess Plateau will suffer increased challenges: the decline in water availability will lead to more frequent droughts, yet the risk of flood and soil erosion from extreme precipitation events will not be reduced.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

We also evaluated whether facilitation among neighboring shrubs, as inferred from spatial analyses, influenced shrubline dynamics. Three rectangular plots crossing the <italic>Juniperus pingii</italic> var. <italic>wilsonii</italic> shrubline were sampled at elevations from 4810 to 4917<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>a.s.l. near the Nam Co Lake, central Tibetan Plateau.

Independent, long-term summer temperature reconstructions also were associated with shrub recruitment. Point-pattern analyses were used to characterize spatial patterns of different size classes of shrubs. The three shrublines showed little long-term changes despite ongoing warming; no upward shift has occurred in the past 100<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years. Recruitment was negatively associated with summer temperatures and drought occurrence since the 1920s. Spatial patterns were characterized by clustering at local scales and attraction between the different size classes, suggesting facilitation.

Accordingly, we evaluated the influences of core direction, tree age, tree size, growth rate and species on the climate\u2013growth relationships of 210 tree-ring cores from Kongtong Mountain and Xiaolong Mountain on the semi-arid Chinese Loess Plateau. We employed both the linear methods of correlation and response function analyses, and the nonlinear method of the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). Most trees are sensitive to the moisture availability. Old trees are more sensitive to drought than young trees, which may be related to the intensified hydraulic resistances and reduced photosynthesis in response to drought. Tree cores taken from the southern direction are often more sensitive to drought than cores taken from other directions. The enhanced drought sensitivity for the southern cores may be possibly related to more branches and leaves for photosynthesis. Slow-growing trees show higher correlations with precipitation of the September prior to growth. This indicates that the extremely stressed, slow-growing trees tend to rely largely on nutrients produced prior to the growing season. For the reconstructions of annual drought in this region, we suggest collecting tree cores from the southern side of old trees growing at stressed sites.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Our previous study (Parr and Wang 2014) examines the impact of climate changes during 1950\u20132011 on hydrological processes in the Northeast using the CRB as a case study. Our results showed a clear increase of precipitation intensity and suggested that the basin is entering a wetter regime more subject to meteorological flood conditions than to drought conditions. For this future analysis, three North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) models are used to derive the meteorological forcing for the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model (VIC), using both present day and the future projected A1B scenario climate. Our future projections indicate wetter winters including significantly greater precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture, decreases to spring runoff, and enhanced ET for all four seasons. We also find a shift toward earlier and faster snow melting and an earlier date of peak discharge. Future precipitation extremes show a decreased amount compared to the early 21st Century, but increased when compared to our entire historic period or the late 20th Century, as well as a consistently increasing mean intensity throughout the past and future.

However, intensification of droughts and floods and amplification of precipitation extremes are having critical negative impacts on agriculture. In this study, flood- and drought-affected, flood- and drought-damaged crop areas, and also flood- and drought-induced agricultural loss from 29 provinces across China are analyzed in both space and time. Results indicate the following: (1) Large parts of China are dominated by intensified floods. Comparatively, spatial ranges dominated by intensifying drought hazards are smaller than those by intensifying flood hazards. (2) Drought intensity is increasing in northwest China with moderate changes in the degree of influence. Increasing flood intensity can be observed in northwest, southwest and central China. However, flood risks are higher in arid regions such as northwest China and drought risks are higher in humid regions such as southwest China. (3) Agreements are identified between abrupt behaviors of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas. The change points of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas is in the 1980s in northeast, north and central China and in the 1990s in south and southwest China. Nevertheless, spatial patterns of the change points in the drought-affected and -destroyed crop areas are sporadic but not confirmative. (4) Flood- and drought-induced losses of agricultural production have significant increasing trends in most parts of China. The loss rate and loss magnitude of agriculture before change points are significantly higher than those after change points. (5) Generally, amplifications of precipitation extremes, decreasing consecutive wet days and increasing consecutive dry days in both space and time are the major driving factors behind the changes of drought- and flood-affected, and -destroyed crop areas and their impacts on agriculture across China. These results are theoretically and practically relevant for planning and management of agricultural activities and may help provide a theoretical framework for similar studies in other regions of the globe.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

A broad range of paleoclimate proxy methods have been applied in the Maya Lowlands and the data derived from these methods are sometimes challenging for archaeologists and other non-specialists to interpret. This paper reviews the principal methods used for paleoclimate inference in the region and the rationale for climate proxy interpretation to help researchers working in the Maya Lowlands make sense of paleoclimate datasets. In particular, we focus on analyses of speleothems and lake sediment cores. These two paleoclimate archives have been most widely applied in the Maya Lowlands and have the greatest potential to provide insights into climate change impacts on the ancient Maya. We discuss the development of chronologies for these climate archives, the proxies for past climate change found within them, and how these proxy variables are interpreted. Finally, we present strategies for improving our understanding of proxy paleoclimate data from the Maya Lowlands, including multi-proxy analyses, assessment of spatial variability in past climate change, combined analysis of climate models and proxy data, and the integration of paleoclimatology and archaeology.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Using endogenic carbonate from a sediment sequence from Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc, a maar lake in central Turkey, dated by varve counting and uranium-thorium methods, we present high-resolution (\u223c25 years) oxygen (<italic>\u03b4</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O) and carbon isotope records, supported by carbonate mineralogy data, spanning the late glacial and Holocene. <italic>\u03b4</italic> <sup loc=\"post\">18</sup>O<inf loc=\"post\">carbonate</inf> at Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc has been shown previously to be a strong proxy for regional water balance.

However, uncontrolled exploitation has also led to rapid rates of groundwater depletion in many semi-arid and arid regions that threaten farmers' long-term capacity to adapt to future climate change and extreme events. Declining well yields, which control the potential rate and feasibility of groundwater abstraction, are likely to restrict adaptation to drought, but this interaction has largely been neglected in previous research. In this study, we present a set of numerical hydro-economic simulations that assess the joint biophysical and economic effects of climate variability and well yield on irrigated agriculture through a case study in the Texas High Plains region of the United States. Our results demonstrate that reductions in well yield will constrain farmers' ability to use irrigation as an adaptive tool, and may have large negative economic impacts on production. Significantly, economic impacts will be greatest during drought events that are projected to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. We suggest therefore that management of well yields should be a key consideration when evaluating agricultural drought risk adaptation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Least developed countries (LDCs) are becoming the worst sufferer of the impacts due to physical, social and economic as well as knowledge and skills differences. The increasing biophysical vulnerability contexts and intensity in the Asian LDCs causing adverse effects on food security, human health, biodiversity, water resources, hydroelectric power generation, streams, perennial springs, and livelihood. Drought is also responsible for increasing pollution, pests and diseases and forced migration and famine. Information indicates monsoon has become erratic contributing to up-scaling of droughts. South and Southeast Asian LDCs like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia and Lao PDR under the monsoon climatic zone have also been suffering from increasing droughts arising out of delayed and changing distribution patterns of precipitation. Prolong dry spells increase the frequencies of wildfire in grasslands, forests, and range-lands. The rain-fed crops of the plains are facing challenges from soil-moisture stress with projected droughts. Droughts causing migration of fishes, and marine anadromus species are having adverse impacts on spawning habitats.

Many studies revealed that balanced fertilization can improve photosynthetic activity by stabilizing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, improve proline, abscisic acid (ABA) and make the crop drought tolerant with efficient root system and finally improve crop yield. To mitigate drought stress, along with the usage of resistant and efficient genotypes, soil and foliar applications of macro- and micro-nutrients are being used in Asia. According to drought sensitivity index, the efficient genotypes are found more drought-tolerant than the inefficient ones. Studies revealed that irrigation alone is not sufficient to obtain satisfactory grain yield without balanced fertilization. At drought stress, the efficient genotypes accumulate higher quantities of ABA and proline, and exhibit higher activities of SOD, as compared with inefficient genotypes through greater nutrient accumulation by their longer and thinner root systems with high efficiency. Under severe drought with low nutritional status, the rate of photosynthesis, particularly water-use efficiency (WUE) increases in the efficient genotypes than in the inefficient ones. Consequently, these physiological and morphological parameters result in better yield performance by efficient use of water. Under drought, soil application of NPK along with foliar application of zinc (Zn), boron (B) and manganese (Mn) increase grain yield as well as micronutrients concentration of the grain. The rate of photosynthesis, pollen viability, number of fertile spikes, number of grains per spike, and WUE are increased by late foliar application of these micronutrients. This indicates that, by increasing WUE foliar application of Zn, B and Mn at booting to anthesis can reduce the harmful effects of drought that often occur during the late stages of cereal production in Asian LDCs. Therefore, it can be concluded that soil application of Zn, B and Mn in early stage combined with foliar application in late stage, especially at the flowering stage, is a promising approach to alleviate drought stress. Another attractive environmental friendly approach is to select efficient and drought tolerant genotypes with a more efficient root system. These findings are of high relevance for farmers\u05f3 practices, the extension service and fertilizer industry to mitigate the drought stress in Asian LDCs. A few recommendations are made for extension of scientific knowledge to find more scope in support of mitigating drought situation.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

More specifically, the study analyzes the weather extreme which affected maize production in the USA in 2012; it also estimates the effect of a similar weather extreme in 2050, using future climate scenarios. The secondary impact of the weather extreme on food security in the developing world is also assessed using trend analysis.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0070\" view=\"all\">Many studies have reported on the significant reduction in maize production in the USA due to the extreme weather event (combined heat wave and drought) that occurred in 2012. However, most of these studies focused on yield and did not assess the potential effect of weather extremes on food prices and security. The overall goal of this study was to use geo-spatial crop modeling and trend analysis to quantify the impact of weather extremes on both yield and, followed food security in the developing world.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0075\" view=\"all\">We used historical weather data for severe extreme events that have occurred in the USA. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition we used five climate scenarios: the baseline climate which is typical of the late 20th century (2000s) and four future climate scenarios which involve a combination of two emission scenarios (A1B and B1) and two global circulation models (CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC 3.2). DSSAT 4.5 was combined with GRASS GIS for geo-spatial crop modeling. Simulated maize grain yield across all affected regions in the USA indicates that average grain yield across the USA Corn Belt would decrease by 29% when the weather extremes occur using the baseline climate. If the weather extreme were to occur under the A1B emission scenario in the 2050s respectively, average grain yields would decrease by 38% and 57%, under the CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC 3.2 global climate models, respectively.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0080\" view=\"all\">The weather extremes that occurred in the USA in 2012 resulted in a sharp increase in the world maize price. In addition, it likely played a role in the reduction in world maize consumption and trade in 2012/13, compared to 2011/12. The most vulnerable countries to the weather extremes are poor countries with high maize import dependency ratios including those countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and western Asia. Other vulnerable countries include low-income countries with low import dependency ratios but which cannot afford highly-priced maize. The study also highlighted the pathways through which a weather extreme would affect food security, were it to occur in 2050 under climate change.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"sp0085\" view=\"all\">Some of the policies which could help vulnerable countries counter the negative effects of weather extremes consist of social protection and safety net programs. Medium- to long-term adaptation strategies include increasing world food reserves to a level where they can be used to cover the production losses brought by weather extremes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

These plans have recently become widespread across EU southern basins. However, in some of these basins the plans were approved without an assessment of the potential impacts that they may have on the economic activities exposed to water restrictions. This paper develops a stochastic methodology to estimate the expected water availability in agriculture that results from the decision rules of the recently approved DMPs. The methodology is applied to the particular case of the Guadalquivir River Basin in southern Spain. Results show that if DMPs are successfully enforced, available water will satisfy in average 62.2% of current demand, and this figure may drop to 50.2% by the end of the century as a result of climate change.

Using the typical adjustment procedure that matches the mean and standard deviation of tree ring PDSI values to those of instrumental data shows over 10 droughts from 800 to 2006 that were more severe than the 1\u2009year 2014 drought, with the 2014 drought having a return period of 140\u2013180\u2009years. Quantile mapping allows for a closer correspondence between instrumental and tree ring PDSI probability distributions and produces return periods of 700\u2013900\u2009years for the 1\u2009year 2014 drought. Associated cumulative 3 and 4\u2009year droughts, however, are estimated to be much more severe. The 2012\u20132014 drought is nearly a 10,000\u2009year event, while the 2012\u20132015 drought has an almost incalculable return period and is completely without precedent.\n",

In the vast evergreen forests encircling this small city in Canada's Northwest Territories, years of drought had set the scene for a historic fire year. Across the territories, 3.4 million hectares burned\u2014an area equal to the state of Maryland, and seven times the annual average. The smoke darkened the sky, stung eyes, and filled Yellowknife residents with \"a sense of panic,\" says Frank Lepine, who manages wildfire response for the Northwest Territories government. When the snow fell and the fires died, Lepine's army of firefighters\u2014about 1000 strong at one point\u2014could stand down. But for scientists, the work is just beginning. The fires, they say, were an extreme example of the forces transforming the boreal forest, a stronghold of spruce, pine, and other conifers that rings the top of the planet. With its millions of square kilometers of pristine timber, thick carpet of moss and needles, and organic-rich frozen soil, the boreal forest stores more carbon than any other land ecosystem. And more than any other forest, it is bearing the brunt of climate change, warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet.\nAuthor: Tim Appenzeller",

Interactions from increasing temperatures, drought, native insects and pathogens, and uncharacteristically severe wildfire are resulting in forest mortality beyond the levels of 20th-century experience. Additional anthropogenic stressors, such as atmospheric pollution and invasive species, further weaken trees in some regions. Although continuing climate change will likely drive many areas of temperate forest toward large-scale transformations, management actions can help ease transitions and minimize losses of socially valued ecosystem services.\nAuthors: Constance I.

        "description": "\n\nThe objective of this study is to produce an observationally based monthly evapotranspiration (ET) product using the simple water balance equation across the conterminous United States (CONUS). We adopted the best quality ground and satellite-based observations of the water budget components, i.e., precipitation, runoff, and water storage change, while ET is computed as the residual. Precipitation data are provided by the bias-corrected PRISM observation-based precipitation data set, while runoff comes from observed monthly streamflow values at 592 USGS stream gauging stations that have been screened by strict quality controls. We developed a land surface model-based downscaling approach to disaggregate the monthly GRACE equivalent water thickness data to daily, 0.125\u00b0 values. The derived ET computed as the residual from the water balance equation is evaluated against three sets of existing ET products. The similar spatial patterns and small differences between the reconstructed ET in this study and the other three products show the reliability of the observationally based approach. The new ET product and the disaggregated GRACE data provide a unique, important hydro-meteorological data set that can be used to evaluate the other ET products as a benchmark data set, assess recent hydrological and climatological changes, and terrestrial water and energy cycle dynamics across the CONUS. These products will also be valuable for studies and applications in drought assessment, water resources management, and climate change evaluation.\n",

Based on the ensemble of calculations, California drought conditions were record-breaking in 2014, but probably not record-breaking in 2012\u20132014, contrary to prior findings. Regionally, the 2012\u20132014 drought was record-breaking in the agriculturally important southern Central Valley and highly populated coastal areas. Contributions of individual climate variables to recent drought are also examined, including the temperature component associated with anthropogenic warming. Precipitation is the primary driver of drought variability but anthropogenic warming is estimated to have accounted for 8\u201327% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012\u20132014 and 5\u201318% in 2014. Although natural variability dominates, anthropogenic warming has substantially increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe tropical rain belt is a narrow band of clouds near the equator, where the most intense rainfall on the planet occurs. On seasonal timescales, the rain moves across the equator following the sun, resulting in wet and dry seasons in the tropics. The position of the tropical rain belt also varies on longer time scales. Through the latter half of the 20th century, for example, shifts in tropical rainfall have been associated with severe droughts, including the African Sahel and Amazon droughts. Here, I show that climate models project a northward migration of the tropical rain belt through the 21st century, with future anthropogenic aerosol reductions driving the bulk of the shift. Models that include both aerosol indirect effects yield significantly larger northward shifts than models that lack aerosol indirect effects. Moreover, the rate of the shift corresponds to the rate of the decrease of anthropogenic aerosol emissions across different time periods and future emission scenarios. This response is consistent with relative warming of the Northern Hemisphere, a decrease in northward cross-equatorial moist static energy transport, and a northward shift of the Hadley circulation, including the tropical rain belt. The shift is relatively weak in the Atlantic sector, consistent with both a smaller decrease in aerosol emissions and a larger reduction in northward cross equatorial ocean heat flux. Although aerosol effects remain uncertain, I conclude that future reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions may be the dominant driver of a 21st century northward shift of the tropical rain belt.\n",

The models simulate periods with in-phase seasonal precipitation anomalies, but the strength of this relationship is variable on multidecadal time scales, behavior that is also exhibited by the reconstructions. The models, however, are unable to simulate periods with consistently out-of-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies as observed in the latter part of the instrumental interval. The periods with predominantly in-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies in the models are significant against randomness, and while this result is suggestive of a potential for dual-season drought on interannual and longer time scales, models do not consistently exhibit the persistent dual-season drought seen in the dendroclimatic reconstructions. These collective findings indicate that model-derived drought risk assessments may underestimate the potential for dual-season drought in 21st century projections of hydroclimate in the American Southwest and parts of Mexico.\n",

In particular, a reconstructed \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a-like\u201d pattern during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) has been widely tied to medieval droughts in southwest North America. This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model (GCM) simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Ni\u00f1a-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) ensemble. Our results caution against drawing dynamical interpretations from a single CFR, and affirm the importance of developing CFRs through improved statistical methodology and community-driven proxy syntheses.\n",

Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.\n",

This study aims to evaluate the ability of a set of global impact models (GIMs) from the WaterMIP project to reproduce the regional hydrology of the central United States for the period 1963\u20132001. Hydrological indices describing annual daily maximum, medium and minimum flow and their timing are extracted from both modeled daily runoff data by nine GIMs and from observed daily streamflow measured at 252 river gauges. We compare trend patterns for these indices, and their ability to capture runoff volume differences for the 1988 drought and 1993 flood. In addition, we use a subset of 128 gauges and corresponding gridcells to perform a detailed evaluation of the models on a gauge-to-gridcell basis. Results indicate that these GIMs capture the overall trends in high, medium, and low flows well. However, the models differ from obervations with respect to the timing of high and medium flows. More specifically, GIMs that only include water balance tend to be closer to the observations than GIMs that also include the energy balance. In general, as it would be expected, the performance of the GIMs is the best when describing medium flows, as opposed to the two ends of the runoff spectrum. With regards to low flows, some of the GIMs having considerably large pools of zeros or low values in their time series, undermining their ability in capturing low flow characteristics and weakening the ensemble's output. Overall, this study provides a valuable examination of the capability of GIMs to reproduce observed regional hydrology over a range of quantities for the central United States.\n",

This study aims to perform a diagnostic analysis of the observed climate conditions during this event, including an inspection of the occurred precipitation anomalies in the context of previous years, and an investigation of possible relationships with sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns. The sea surface temperature analysis revealed that the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean region near the coast of southeast Brazil showed strong negative association with precipitation over southeast Brazil, indicating that increased sea temperatures in this ocean region are consistent with reduced precipitation as observed in summer 2014. The circulation analysis revealed prevailing anti-cyclonic anomalies at lower levels (850\u00a0hPa) with northerly anomalies to the west of southeast Brazil, channeling moisture from the Amazon towards Paraguay, northern Argentina and southern Brazil, and drier than normal air from the South Atlantic Ocean towards the southeast region of Brazil. This circulation pattern was found to be part of a large-scale teleconnection wave train linked with the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific, which in turn was generated by an anomalous tropical heat source in north/northeastern Australia. A regional Hadley circulation with an ascending branch to the south of the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific was identified as an important component connecting the tropical and extratropical circulation. The ascending branch of this Hadley circulation in the south Pacific coincided with an identified Rossby wave source region, which contributed to establishing the extratropical component of the large-scale wave train connecting the south Pacific and the Atlantic region surrounding southeast Brazil. This connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic was confirmed with Rossby ray tracing analyses. The local circulation response was associated to downward air motion (subsidence) over Southeast Brazil, contributing to the expressive negative precipitation anomalies observed during summer 2014, and leading to a major drought event in the historical context. The analysis of atmospheric and oceanic patterns of this event helped defining a schematic framework leading to the observed drought conditions in southeast Brazil, including the involved teleconnections, blocking high pressure, radiative and humidity transport effects.</p>\n                ",

        "description": "\n\nThe Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and its impacts on precipitation over eastern China during the last millennium are investigated through analyzing two 1000\u2009year global climate model simulations. Results show that the model does not simulate a prolonged period of negative IPO before A.D. 1300 suggested by the proxy reconstruction, although it does simulate centennial periods of negative and positive IPO. The simulated IPO exhibits several low-frequency oscillations, including 10\u201323, 30\u201333, 35\u201370, and 85\u2013110\u2009years. However, it remains an open question whether simulated IPO oscillations longer than bidecadal mode can be or not be considered as essentially internal modes of variability. The simulations indicate that precipitation over eastern China is associated with the IPO. When the strongest IPO signal of 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation occurs, the summer precipitation goes of opposite sign over North China (NC) and the middle and lower Yangtze River Vally (MLYRV), i.e., dipole mode such as the \u201cflood-in-south and drought-in-north\u201d pattern that occurs during the positive IPO episodes and vice versa. While coherent mode is dominant when the relatively weak IPO signal occurs, and warm phases of the IPO coincide with coherent drought and vice versa. The association between 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation of the IPO and precipitation in NC is more marked than that in the MLYRV. Our results suggest that the internal variability of climate system like the IPO may play an important role in precipitation over eastern China, at least on the 53\u201377\u2009year oscillation.\n",

Years with anomalously high tropical North Atlantic SSTs during March\u2013June were often followed by a more active hurricane season and a larger number of satellite-detected fires in the southern Amazon during June\u2013November. The relationship between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and southern Amazon fires (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.003) was stronger than links between SSTs and either cyclones or fires alone, suggesting that fires and tropical cyclones were directly coupled to the same underlying atmospheric dynamics governing tropical moisture redistribution.

        "description": "\n\nSocioeconomic drought broadly refers to conditions whereby the water supply cannot satisfy the demand. Most previous studies describe droughts based on large-scale meteorological/hydrologic conditions, ignoring the demand and local resilience to cope with climate variability. Reservoirs provide resilience against climatic extremes and play a key role in water supply and demand management. Here we outline a unique multivariate approach as a measure of socioeconomic drought, termed Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI). The model combines information on the inflow and reservoir storage relative to the demand. MSRRI combines (I) a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach that focuses on processes/phenomena that cannot be simply controlled or altered by decision makers, such as climate change and variability, and (II) a \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology that represents the local resilience and societal capacity to respond or adapt to droughts. MSRRI is based on a nonparametric multivariate distribution function that links inflow-demand reliability indicator to water storage resilience indicator. These indicators are used to assess socioeconomic drought during the Australian Millennium drought (1998\u20132010) and the 2011\u20132014 California drought. The results show that MSRRI is superior to univariate indices because it captures both early onset and persistence of water stress over time. The suggested framework can be applied to both individual reservoirs and a group of reservoirs in a region, and it is consistent with the currently available standardized drought indicators. MSRRI provides complementary information on socioeconomic drought development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand that cannot be achieved from the commonly used drought indicators.\n",

However, identifications of suspended sediment routing patterns through channel junctions and the roles of tributaries on downstream sediment transport in large rivers are still poorly explored. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing-based approach to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of the postconfluence suspended sediment transport by mapping the surface water distribution in the ultimate example of large river confluence on Earth where distinct water types meet: The Solim\u00f5es-Amazon (white water) and Negro (black water) rivers. The surface water types distribution was modeled for three different years: average hydrological condition (2007) and 2 years when extreme events occurred (drought-2005 and flood-2009). Amazonian surface water domination along the main channel is highest during the water discharge rising season. Surface water mixing along the main channel depends on the hydrological seasons with the highest mixed-homogenized area observed during water discharge peak season and the lowest during discharge rising season. Water mixture also depends on the yearly hydrological regime with the highest rates of water mixing in 2009, followed by 2005 and 2007. We conclude that the dominant mixing patterns observed in this study have been persistent over a decadal scale and the anabranching patterns contribute to avoid a faster mixing in a shorter distance. Our proposed approach can be applied to a variety of morphodynamic and environmental analyses in confluences of large rivers around the world.\n",

Runoff is an inherently multivariate process with typical events lasting from hours in case of floods to weeks or even months in case of droughts. This calls for multivariate post-processing techniques that yield well calibrated forecasts in univariate terms and ensure a realistic temporal dependence structure at the same time. To this end, the univariate ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) post-processing method is combined with two different copula approaches that ensure multivariate calibration throughout the entire forecast horizon. The domain of this study covers three sub-catchments of the river Rhine that represent different sizes and hydrological regimes: the Upper Rhine up to the gauge Maxau, the river Moselle up to the gauge Trier, and the river Lahn up to the gauge Kalkofen. In this study the two approaches to model the temporal dependence structure are ensemble copula coupling (ECC), which preserves the dependence structure of the raw ensemble, and a Gaussian copula approach (GCA), which estimates the temporal correlations from training observations. The results indicate that both methods are suitable for modelling the temporal dependencies of probabilistic hydrologic forecasts. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

The resulting diversity of traits include a continuum of isohydry-anisohydry or high to low relative stomatal closure during drought, shedding of canopy foliage or disconnecting roots from soil to survive drought, and adjusting root areas to efficiently manage canopy water costs associated with photosynthesis. These traits are examined within TREES, an integrated model that explicitly couples photosynthesis and carbon allocation to soil-plant hydraulics and canopy processes. Key advances of the model are its ability to account for differences in soil and xylem cavitation, transience of hydraulic impairment associated with delayed or no refilling of xylem, and carbon allocation to plant structures based on photosynthetic uptake of carbon and hydraulic limitations to water transport. The model was used to examine hydraulic traits of cooccurring isohydric (pi\u00f1on pine) and anisohydric (one-seed juniper) trees from a field-based experimental drought. Model predictions of both transpiration and leaf water potential were improved when there was no refilling of xylem over simulations where xylem was able refill in response to soil water recharge. Model experiments with alternative root-to-leaf area ratios (RR/L) showed the RR/L that supports maximum cumulative water use is not beneficial for supporting maximum carbon gain during extended drought, illustrating how a process model reveals trade-offs in plant traits.\n",

Current systems analysis practice is widespread and addresses the most challenging water issues of our times, including water scarcity and drought, climate change, providing water for food and energy production, decision making amid competing objectives, and bringing economic incentives to bear on water use. The emergence of public recognition and concern for the state of water resources provides an opportune moment for the field to reorient to meet the complex, interdependent, interdisciplinary, and global nature of today's water challenges. At present, water resources systems analysis is limited by low scientific and academic visibility relative to its influence in practice and bridled by localized findings that are difficult to generalize. The evident success of water resource systems analysis in practice (which is set out in this paper) needs in future to be strengthened by substantiating the field as the science of water resources that seeks to predict the water resources variables and outcomes that are important to governments, industries, and the public the world over. Doing so promotes the scientific credibility of the field, provides understanding of the state of water resources and furnishes the basis for predicting the impacts of our water choices.\n",

Four extreme temperature indices (TXx, TNn, SU30, and TMINmean) and five extreme precipitation indices (Rx1day, Rx5day, SDII, R50mm, and SDII) defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) were used in the investigation. The performance of the model was validated through comparison between observations and simulations for the period 1971\u20132000. The results show that although RegCM4.0 has certain abilities to reproduce both the spatial distributions of the values of extreme climate indices and their trends in the Zhujiang River basin, there are some large biases in the model results. The model simulates extreme temperatures more accurately than extreme precipitation. Compared to the baseline period 1971\u20132000, the changes in future (2021\u20132050 and 2051\u20132080) climate extremes under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios show very similar patterns, with an increase in extreme temperatures across the entire region and an increase in extreme precipitation in most parts of the region. For the period 2006\u20132099, a significant warming trend can be expected under both emissions scenarios, especially under the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The risk of drought shows statistically significant increasing trends under the RCP8.5 scenario in most parts of the region, especially in the central part of the basin. Meanwhile, more intense rainfall events are expected to occur in most parts of the region, especially in the southern parts of the basin. Furthermore, the increases predicted under the RCP8.5 scenario are more pronounced than those predicted under the RCP4.5 scenario. Overall, our results suggest that the Zhujiang River basin will suffer more natural disasters, such as catastrophic floods, droughts, and heat weaves, in the future.\n",

Pb and As are exported\nalong with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems,\nbut it is not yet clear which hydrological (pre)conditions favor their\nexport. This study combines a 1-year monitoring of precipitation, bog\nwater level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC,\niron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb\nexports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L<sup>\u22121</sup> for DOC, 0.2 to 1.9 \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup> for As,\nand 1.3 to 12 \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup> for Pb, with highest\nconcentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly\ncorrelated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge,\nas 40 % of As and 43 % of Pb were exported during 10 % of the time with\nthe highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of\nshort-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export.\nExponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by\nconnection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water\ntable rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC\nconcentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble\nPb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC\nand As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our\ndata indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s<sup>\u22121</sup>,\nwhich is thought to depend mainly on the bogs size and drainage conditions.\nAbove this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and\ndischarge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that\nAs and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and\ndischarge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations.\nComparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates\nthat As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for\n0.85 and 0.27 &permil; of total As and Pb\ninventory, respectively.",

The YIBs model\nadapts routines from the mature TRIFFID (Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage\nand Flora Including Dynamics) and CASA (Carnegie\u2013Ames\u2013Stanford Approach) models to simulate\ninteractive carbon assimilation, allocation, and autotrophic and\nheterotrophic respiration. Dynamic daily leaf area index is simulated based\non carbon allocation and temperature- and drought-dependent prognostic\nphenology. YIBs incorporates a semi-mechanistic ozone vegetation damage\nscheme. Here, we validate the present-day YIBs land carbon fluxes for three\nincreasingly complex configurations: (i) offline local site level, (ii)\noffline global forced with WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to\nERA-Interim data) meteorology, and (iii) online coupled to the NASA ModelE2\n(NASA ModelE2-YIBs). Offline YIBs has hourly and online YIBs has\nhalf-hourly temporal resolution. The large observational database used for\nvalidation includes carbon fluxes from 145 flux tower sites and multiple\nsatellite products. At the site level, YIBs simulates reasonable seasonality\n(correlation coefficient <i>R</i> > 0.8) of gross primary productivity\n(GPP) at 121 out of 145 sites with biases in magnitude ranging from \u221219\nto 7 % depending on plant functional type.

This study presents an assessment of the monthly precipitation forecast of the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) for three agroecological zones (Sudan-Sahel, Sudan, and Guinean zone) of the Volta Basin. The CFSv2 performance is evaluated for the Sahel drought 1983 and for all August months of the reforecast period (1982\u20132009) with lead times up to 8\u00a0months using a quantile-quantile transformation for bias correction. In addition, an operational experiment is performed for the rainy season 2013 to analyze the performance of a dynamical downscaling approach for this region. Twenty-two CFSv2 ensemble members initialized in February 2013 are transferred to a resolution of 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km using the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model. Since the uncorrected CFSv2 precipitation forecasts are characterized by a high uncertainty (up to 175% of the observed variability), the quantile-quantile transformation can clearly reduce this overestimation with the potential to provide skillful and valuable early warnings of precipitation deficits and excess up to 6\u00a0months in ahead, particularly for the Sudan-Sahel zone. The operational experiment illustrates that CFSv2-WRF can reduce the CFSv2 uncertainty (up to 69%) for monthly precipitation and the onset of the rainy season but has still strong deficits regarding the northward progression of the rain belt. Further studies are necessary for a more robust assessment of the techniques applied in this study to confirm these promising outcomes.\n",

However, the understanding of drought mechanism and predictability is limited. Based on the hindcasts from multiple climate models, the predictability and forecast skill for drought over China are investigated. The 3-month standardized precipitation index (SPI3) is used as the drought index, and the predictability is quantified by using a perfect model assumption. Ensemble hindcasts from multiple climate models are assessed individually and the grand multi-model ensemble is also evaluated. Drought forecast skill for model ensemble mean is higher than individual ensemble members, and NMME grand ensemble performs the best. Predictability is higher than forecast skill, indicating the room for improving drought forecast. Drought predictability and forecast skill are positively correlated in general, but they vary depending on seasons, regions and forecast leads. Higher drought predictability and forecast skill are found over regimes where ENSO has significant impact. For the ENSO-affected regimes, both drought predictability and forecast skill in ENSO years are higher than that in neutral years. This study suggests that predictability not only provides a measure for selecting climate models for ensemble drought forecast in ENSO-affected regimes, but also serves as an indicator for forecast skill especially when in-situ and/or remote sensing measurements for the hindcast verifications are considered unreliable.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn the long term, precipitation in the central U.S. decreases by about 25% during the seasonal transition from June to July. This precipitation decrease is observed to have intensified since 1979, and such intensification could have enhanced spring drought occurrences in the central U.S., in which conditions quickly evolve from being abnormally dry to exceptionally dry. Various atmospheric and land reanalysis datasets were analyzed to examine the trend in the June-to-July seasonal transition. It was found that the intensified deficit in precipitation was accompanied by increased downward shortwave radiation flux, tropospheric subsidence, enhanced evaporative fraction, and elevated planetary boundary layer height, all of which could and did lead to surface drying. The change in tropospheric circulation was characterized by an anomalous ridge over the western U.S. and a trough on either side \u2013 a pattern known to suppress rainfall in the central U.S. The pattern of these trends calculated from 1979 to 2011 shows similarity with the evolution of the 2012 record drought from spring to summer.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis study investigates the effects of irrigation on global water resources by performing and analyzing Community Land Model 4.0 (CLM4) simulations driven by downscaled/bias-corrected historical simulations and future projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs). For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were performed: (1) a CTRL experiment in which all crops are assumed to be rainfed; (2) an IRRIG experiment in which the irrigation module is activated using surface water (SW) to feed irrigation; and (3) a PUMP experiment in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the irrigation module is activated for conjunctive use of surface- and groundwater (GW) for irrigation. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping are calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based water use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Our results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major effects: SW (GW) depletion in regions with irrigation primarily fed by SW (GW), respectively. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on SW tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions, suggesting increased vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21st century, combined effect of increased irrigation water demand and amplified temporal-spatial variability of water supply may lead to severe local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate/alleviate climate-induced changes of SW/GW although such effects are negligible when averaged globally. Our study highlights the need to account for irrigation effects and sources in assessing regional climate change impacts. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

California has a well-pronounced rain season that peaks in December-February. However, the 95% confidence interval around the climatological precipitation during these months imply that deviations on the order of 60% of the expected amounts are very likely during the most important period of the rain season. While these positive and negative anomalies alternate almost every year and tend to cancel each other, severe multi-year declines of precipitation in California appear on decadal scales. The 1986-1994 decline of precipitation was similar to the current one that started in 2011, and is apparent in the reanalysis data. In terms of accumulated deficits of precipitation, that episode was no less severe than the current one. While El Ni\u00f1o (the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, ENSO) is frequently cited as the natural forcing expected to bring a relief from drought, our assessment is that ENSO has been driving at best only 6% of precipitation variability in California in the past three decades. Using fractional risk analysis of precipitation during typical versus drying periods, we show that the likelihood of losing the most intensive precipitation events drastically increases during the multi-year drying events. Storms delivering up to 50% of the precipitation in California are driven by atmospheric rivers making landfall. However, these phenomena can be suppressed and even blocked by persistent ridges of atmospheric pressure in the northeast Pacific. The reanalysis and satellite data are proven to be reliable to the extent where they yield information on developing conditions and observed precipitation anomalies.\n",

Ciais<br /><br />The exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the atmosphere\n  and the Amazon basin have global implications for the current and future\n  climate. Here, the global atmospheric inversion system of the\n  Monitoring of Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) service is\n  used to study the seasonal and interannual variations of\n  biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in Amazonia during the period 2002\u20132010. The\n  system assimilated surface measurements of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> mole\n  fractions made at more than 100 sites over the globe into an atmospheric\n  transport model. The present study adds measurements from four surface\n  stations located in tropical South America, a region poorly covered by\n  CO<sub>2</sub> observations. The estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE)\n  optimized by the inversion are compared to an independent estimate of\n  NEE upscaled from eddy-covariance flux measurements in Amazonia. They\n  are also qualitatively evaluated against reports on the seasonal and\n  interannual variations of the land sink in South America from the\n  scientific literature. We attempt at assessing the impact on NEE of\n  the strong droughts in 2005 and 2010 (due to severe and longer-than-usual\n  dry seasons) and  the extreme rainfall conditions registered in 2009.\n  The spatial variations of the seasonal and interannual variability of\n  optimized NEE are also investigated. While the inversion supports the\n  assumption of strong spatial heterogeneity of these variations, the\n  results reveal critical limitations of the coarse-resolution transport model,\n  the surface observation network in South America during the recent\n  years and the present knowledge of modelling uncertainties in South\n  America that prevent our inversion from capturing the seasonal patterns\n  of fluxes across Amazonia. However, some patterns from the inversion\n  seem consistent with the anomaly of moisture conditions in 2009.",

        "description": "\n\nReservoir sizing is a critical task as the storage in a reservoir must be sufficient to supply water during extended droughts. Typically, sequent peak algorithm (SQP) is used with observed streamflow to obtain reservoir storage estimates. To overcome the limited sample length of observed streamflow, synthetic streamflow traces estimated from observed streamflow characteristics are provided with SQP to estimate the distribution of storage. However, the parameters in the stochastic streamflow generation model are derived from the observed record and are still unrepresentative of the long-term drought records. Paleo-streamflow time series, usually reconstructed using tree-ring chronologies, span for a longer period than the observed streamflow and provide additional insight into the preinstrumental drought record. This study investigates the capability of reconstructed streamflow records in reducing the uncertainty in reservoir storage estimation. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that combines observed and reconstructed streamflow for estimating the parameters of the stochastic streamflow generation model. By utilizing reconstructed streamflow records from two potential stations over the Southeastern U.S., the distribution of storage estimated using the combined streamflows is compared with the distribution of storage estimated using observed streamflow alone based on split-sample validation. Results show that combining observed and reconstructed streamflow yield stochastic streamflow generation parameters more representative of the longer streamflow record resulting in improved reservoir storage estimates. We also generalize the findings through a synthetic experiment by generating reconstructed streamflow records of different sample length and skill. The analysis shows that uncertainty in storage estimates reduces by incorporating reconstruction records with higher skill and longer sample lengths. Potential applications of the proposed methodology are also discussed.\n",

On the other hand, such plantations have been questioned\noccasionally for their possible negative impacts on water availability\ndue to the higher water-use nature of poplar trees compared with other tree\nspecies in water-limited dryland regions. To further understand the\nacclimation of poplar species to semiarid environments and to evaluate the\npotential impacts of these plantations on the broader context of the\nregion's water supply, we examine the variability of bulk resistance\nparameters and energy partitioning in a poplar (<i>Populus euramericana</i> cv. \"74/76\") plantation\nlocated in northern China over a 4-year period, encompassing both dry and\nwet conditions. The partitioning of available energy to latent heat flux\n(LE) decreased from 0.62 to 0.53 under mediated meteorological drought by\nirrigation applications. A concomitant increase in sensible heat flux (<i>H</i>)\nresulted in the increase of a Bowen ratio from 0.83 to 1.57. Partial\ncorrelation analysis indicated that surface resistance (<i>R</i><sub>s</sub>) normalized\nby leaf area index (LAI; <i>R</i><sub>s</sub>:LAI) increased by 50 % under drought\nconditions and was the dominant factor controlling the Bowen ratio.\nFurthermore, <i>R</i><sub>s</sub> was the main factor controlling LE during the growing\nseason, even in wet years, as indicated by the decoupling coefficient\n(&Omega; = 0.45 and 0.39 in wet and dry years, respectively). <i>R</i><sub>s</sub> was\nalso a major regulator of the LE / LE<sub>eq</sub> ratio, which decreased from 0.81\nin wet years to 0.68 in dry years.

It has been suggested that this warming may increase the frequency or severity of droughts. We define a quantitative and objective aridity index that describes the precipitation forcing function of drought. Using the extensive historical database of precipitation records, we evaluate changes in the aridity in the 48 contiguous United States. The area-averaged mean fractional rate of change of aridity of 1218 sites in the period 1893\u20132013 was (\u22126.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20094 per year; the 48 contiguous United States became less arid. The rate of decrease of aridity was roughly consistent with expectations from the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation and the rate of warming. The fractional rate of change of aridity was nearly uncorrelated with the aridity itself, but there were regional differences: many Western and coastal Southeastern sites showed increasing aridity, but regions of rapidly decreasing aridity were found in a band 85\u2218\u2013100\u2218W and the Northeast.\n",

Gross pollution is seen in developing economies, nutrient pollution is a global threat to aquatic ecosystems, and flood damage is increasing. Droughts have severe local consequences, but effects on food can be global. These current pressures are set in the context of rapid environmental change and socio-economic development, population growth, and weak and fragmented governance. We ask what should be the role of the water science community in addressing water security challenges. Deeper understanding of aquatic and terrestrial environments and their interactions with the climate system is needed, along with trans-disciplinary analysis of vulnerabilities to environmental and societal change. The human dimension must be fully integrated into water science research and viewed as an endogenous component of water system dynamics. Land and water management are inextricably linked, and thus more cross-sector coordination of research and policy is imperative. To solve real-world problems, the products of science must emerge from an iterative, collaborative, two-way exchange with management and policy communities. Science must produce knowledge that is deemed to be credible, legitimate, and salient by relevant stakeholders, and the social process of linking science to policy is thus vital to efforts to solve water problems. The paper shows how a large-scale catchment-based observatory can be used to practice trans-disciplinary science integration and address the Anthropocene's water problems.\n",

The review includes a history of droughts and floods in the past, in the present and some discussions on future extremes in the context of climate change and its impacts on the Amazon region. Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as \u2018once in a century\u2019, have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river's main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012\u20132015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Ni\u00f1a/El Ni\u00f1o events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.\n",

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the dominant rainfall patterns over Bhutan. An attempt has also been made to correct precipitation biases in the satellite-only products using a gamma (\u03b3)-based distribution approach. Results indicated that APHRODITE and satellite-based precipitation products were able to adequately capture the spatio-temporal patterns of rainfall variability over Bhutan. Extreme precipitation events and extreme drought periods were well captured with very good correlations (>0.5). APHRODITE and TRMM 3B43v7 were remarkably similar, whereas satellite-only products (CMORPH and CHIRP) highly underestimated (20\u201360% or 200\u2013450 mm month\u22121) monsoon rainfall over Bhutan. While TRMM 3B43v7 still underestimated monsoon rainfall (by \u223c25%), it has significantly improved the seasonal bias (by 20\u201340%) from its previous version (TRMM 3B43v6). CHIRP performed relatively better in the high rainfall regions but indicated very low correlations over mountainous regions and during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The bias correction approach indicated best results for TRMM 3B43v6 (up to 33%) in the Southern Foothills, whereas satellite-only products improved only moderately (5\u201320%).\n",

We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA new index, namely the African South Westerly Index (ASWI), based on the persistence of the low-level south westerly winds in the region [29\u00b0W-17\u00b0W;7\u00b0N-13\u00b0N] is developed to characterise the strength of the West African Monsoon. The ASWI is significantly correlated with the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel in the 1900\u20132013 period (r\u2009=\u2009+0.57, r\u2009=\u2009+0.66 and r\u2009=\u2009+0.53 for July, August and September respectively). By using historical wind direction measurements it has been possible to compute the ASWI back to 1790 for July and to 1839 for August and September, thus providing the first instrumental record of the West African Monsoon strength for a large portion of the 19th century.\nSince the 1970s, the Sahel has experienced a strong and persistent drought. During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel. Notwithstanding, two of the few dry years within this period were concurrent with large volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere. This latter result supports the recently described relationship between major volcanic eruptions and the occurrence of isolated drought episodes in the Sahel.\n",

Y. Maezumi, M. J. Power, F. E. Mayle, K. K. McLauchlan, and J. Iriarte<br /><br />Cerr\u00e3do savannas have the greatest fire activity of all major global land-cover\ntypes and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. During the\n21st century, temperatures are projected to increase by ~ 3 \u00b0C coupled with a precipitation decrease of\n~ 20%. Although these conditions could potentially\nintensify drought stress, it is unknown how that might alter vegetation\ncomposition and fire regimes. To assess how Neotropical savannas responded\nto past climate changes, a 14 500-year, high-resolution, sedimentary record\nfrom Huanchaca Mesetta, a palm swamp located in the cerr\u00e3do savanna in northeastern\nBolivia, was analyzed with phytoliths, stable isotopes, and charcoal. A\nnon-analogue, cold-adapted vegetation community dominated the\nLateglacial\u2013early Holocene period (14 500\u20139000 cal yr BP, which included trees and\nC<sub>3</sub> Pooideae and C<sub>4</sub> Panicoideae grasses. The Lateglacial\nvegetation was fire-sensitive and fire activity during this period was low,\nlikely responding to fuel availability and limitation. Although similar\nvegetation characterized the early Holocene, the warming conditions\nassociated with the onset of the Holocene led to an initial increase in fire\nactivity. Huanchaca Mesetta became increasingly fire-dependent during the\nmiddle Holocene with the expansion of C<sub>4</sub> fire-adapted grasses. However,\nas warm, dry conditions, characterized by increased length and severity of\nthe dry season, continued, fuel availability decreased. The establishment of\nthe modern palm swamp vegetation occurred at 5000 cal yr BP. Edaphic factors\nare the first-order control on vegetation on the rocky quartzite mesetta.\nWhere soils are sufficiently thick, climate is the second-order control of\nvegetation on the mesetta. The presence of the modern palm swamp is\nattributed to two factors: (1) increased precipitation that increased water\ntable levels and (2) decreased frequency and duration of <i>surazos</i> (cold wind\nincursions from Patagonia) leading to increased temperature minima. Natural\n(soil, climate, fire) drivers rather than anthropogenic drivers control the\nvegetation and fire activity at Huanchaca Mesetta. Thus the cerr\u00e3do savanna\necosystem of the Huanchaca Plateau has exhibited ecosystem resilience to\nmajor climatic changes in both temperature and precipitation since the\nLateglacial period.",

Bouimetarhan, L. Dupont, H. Kuhlmann, J. P\u00e4tzold, M. Prange, E. Schefu\u00df, and K. Zonneveld<br /><br />In tropical eastern Africa, vegetation distribution is largely controlled by\nregional hydrology, which has varied over the past 20 000 years. Therefore,\naccurate reconstructions of past vegetation and hydrological changes are\ncrucial for a better understanding of climate variability in the tropical\nsoutheastern African region. We present high-resolution pollen records from\na marine sediment core recovered offshore of the Rufiji River delta. Our data\ndocument significant shifts in pollen assemblages during the last\ndeglaciation, identifying, through changes in both upland and\nlowland vegetation, specific responses of plant communities to atmospheric\n(precipitation) and coastal (coastal dynamics and sea-level changes)\nalterations. Specifically, arid conditions reflected by a maximum pollen\nrepresentation of dry and open vegetation occurred during the Northern\nHemisphere cold Heinrich event 1 (H1), suggesting that the expansion of drier\nupland vegetation was synchronous with cold Northern Hemisphere\nconditions. This arid period is followed by an interval in which forest and\nhumid woodlands expanded, indicating a hydrologic shift towards more humid\nconditions. Droughts during H1 and the shift to humid conditions around 14.8 kyr BP in the uplands are consistent with latitudinal shifts of the\nintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude Northern\nHemisphere climatic fluctuations. Additionally, our results show that the\nlowland vegetation, consisting of well-developed salt marshes and mangroves\nin a successional pattern typical for vegetation occurring in intertidal\nhabitats, has responded mainly to local coastal dynamics related to marine\ninundation frequencies and soil salinity in the Rufiji Delta as well as to the\nlocal moisture availability. Lowland vegetation shows a substantial\nexpansion of mangrove trees after ~ 14.8 kyr BP, suggesting an\nincreased moisture availability and river runoff in the coastal area. The\nresults of this study highlight the decoupled climatic and environmental\nprocesses to which the vegetation in the uplands and the Rufiji Delta has\nresponded during the last deglaciation.",

        "description": "\n\nThirty years (1954\u20131983) of soil moisture data from 60 sites in Iowa are used to identify the dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability. Both soil moisture and precipitation exhibit a northwest to southeast gradient across Iowa, with wetter conditions in the southeast and drier conditions in the northwest. Climate and soil characteristics are responsible for the spatial variations in soil moisture. There is a pronounced annual soil moisture cycle that has three distinct phases: a moist phase (April\u2013June), a drying phase (June\u2013September), and a recharge phase (September\u2013November). Spring soil moisture is strongly controlled by the amount of recharge during the previous fall. There is no evidence of a long-term trend in soil moisture; however there is significant interannual variability and about 20% of the variance is attributable to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The warm (cold) phase of ENSO is associated with above (below) average soil moisture in Iowa. The multi-decadal soil moisture record is used to analyse drought frequency and magnitude in Iowa, and to place the 2012 Midwest drought in historical context. In general, Iowa drought is more common during the latter part of the warm season (August through November), but tends to be more severe during the early part of the warm season (April\u2013July). We find that the 2012 drought was unusual because it persisted and intensified throughout the growing season.\n",

        "description": "\n\nTheoretical probability distributions of seasonal rainfall totals have potential applications in fitting models and generating synthetic data. One of the major challenges in fitting distributions for seasonal rainfall from countries like Australia is that the data differ significantly for various seasons across stations. The wet stations may possess strictly positive rainfall amounts only, whereas dry stations may observe seasons with no rainfall. Furthermore the data ranges from approximately symmetric to highly skewed. We explore fitting distributions from the Tweedie family of distributions to model seasonal rainfall. The Tweedie family of distributions includes continuous-symmetric (normal), continuous-skewed (gamma) and mixture-type (Poisson\u2013gamma, P\u2013G) distributions. This study analysed seasonal rainfall totals from 989 Australian stations with data for about 100\u2009years. For various seasons, within the Tweedie family the P\u2013G distributions were optimal for about 50% of stations, the gamma distributions were near-optimal for approximately 40% and the normal distributions were near-optimal elsewhere. Most of the stations where the gamma distributions are near-optimal are concentrated on the Australian coastline. The quantile\u2013quantile (QQ) plots indicate that the models fit well to the seasonal rainfall totals of selected stations. Almost everywhere, various statistics of observed seasonal rainfall are within the empirical 95% confidence intervals of the respective statistics of simulated data using the Tweedie models. The model performs better in modelling extremely high rainfall events (95th percentiles) than the extremely low (5th percentiles) rainfall events. In addition, the P\u2013G distribution within the Tweedie family models the probability of no rainfall and, for about 97% of stations, the observed probability of no rainfall is within the 95% confidence interval of the simulated probability of no rainfall. The ability of the Tweedie models to simulate the extreme rainfall amounts and the probability of no rainfall can be useful in drought monitoring and in water resources planning and management.\n",

We found that the average drought conditions across the country showed a temporal behaviour mainly characterized by decadal variations. The spatial pattern of drought evolution showed marked differences between the Amazonian region and the Bolivian Altiplano. Both regions showed different drought periods, a lower frequency of drought variability in the Amazon region and trends towards drier conditions in the Altiplano, mainly due to a higher atmospheric water demand as a consequence of increased ETo. We also showed that inclusion of ETo, obtained from maximum and minimum temperature records, increased the spatial heterogeneity of the drought evolution in relation to the evolution observed when only precipitation droughts were considered. The SPEI, the calculation of which includes precipitation and ETo, indicated intensification in drought severity in the last years analysed relative to the pattern found when precipitation droughts alone were considered, and also indicated an increase in the magnitude and duration of drought events. The potential for increasing drought conditions under various climate change scenarios is discussed.\n",

This study compares several forecasting methods using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to predict East African rains with various lead times. It is shown that the forecasts can explain more than 50% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The forecasts also explain more than 50% of the long rains (boreal spring) over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40% of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010\u20132011 forecasts for both the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.\n",

Multi-model approaches may alleviate some of the problems related to uncertainties of projected changes.\nThe bandwidth of future climate conditions in Central Eastern Germany has been estimated, using 12 regional climate projections in daily resolution as simulated within the EU-project ENSEMBLES (emission scenario A1B). Validation of the model runs against an observation data set displayed significant difficulties of the models to describe the regional precipitation characteristics. Shortcomings are particularly obvious in realistically simulating dry period characteristics, likely due to an overestimation of precipitation totals. Most models agree in the projection of more frequent and longer-lasting drought events during summer, while wet phase frequency and persistence is projected to increase in winter. Extreme precipitation events (99th percentile) are likely to increase by the end of the 21st century in most seasons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0even in summer, despite projected decreasing average precipitation.\nThe suggested display of all individual model results allows comparing the characteristics and the trend behaviour of the individual regional climate projections.

Based on datasets from ECMWF/ERA-Interim on atmospheric circulation and sea level pressure and on rainfall data from meteorological networks from 1979 to 2013, droughts in the YRB are investigated in the present work. Rainfall in summer in the northern YRB (semi-arid and semi-humid zones) has been low since 1990, which is associated with an anomaly of planetary waves around Lake Baikal. These waves are significantly affected by Arctic ice loss (particularly in the eastern Arctic) among other factors. Eastern Arctic ice loss results in a warmer surface and increases air temperatures over the Arctic and northern Siberia. These conditions are favourable for cyclonic anomalies in the lower troposphere, generating an ascending flow anomaly over the eastern Arctic and a positive anomaly of meridional wind in the low troposphere between high latitudes and the Arctic. This situation results in a weaker Polar cell and a stronger Ferrel cell in the three-cell latitudinal circulation, due to increasing the ascending flow at approximately 60\u00b0N as well as the descending flow at approximately 35\u00b0\u201353\u00b0N. These conditions favour reinforcement as well as the width of subtropical high pressures, meridional shifts or northward elongation, the anomaly of planetary wave ridges around Lake Baikal, finally, more severe droughts in the northern YRB. Simulations performed with an atmospheric general circulation model confirm that Arctic sea ice loss can induce a northward shift and enhancement of subtropical high pressures, together with decreasing rainfall in the mid-latitudes of both North America and East Asia, especially in the northern YRB.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe science that humans are the cause of global warming, and that the associated climate change would lead to serious changes in climate extreme events, food production, freshwater resources, biodiversity, human mortality, etc. is unequivocal. After several political negotiations, a 2\u2009\u00b0C warming has been considered to be the benchmark for such damaging changes. However, an increasing amount of scientific research indicates that higher levels of warming are increasingly likely. What would the world be like if such higher levels of warming occurred? This study aims to provide information for better politically driven mitigation through an investigation of the changes in temperature- and precipitation-based extreme indices using CMIP5 (coupled model intercomparison project phase 5) simulations of a warming of 1, 2, and 3\u2009\u00b0C in China. Warming simulations show more dramatic effects in China compared with the global average. In general, the results show relatively small change signals in climate extreme events in China at 1\u2009\u00b0C, larger anomalies at 2\u2009\u00b0C, and stronger and more extended anomalies at 3\u2009\u00b0C. Changes in the studied temperature indices indicate that warm events would be more frequent and stronger in the future, and that cold events would be reduced and weakened. For changes in the precipitation indices, extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation, and China will experience more intensified extreme precipitation events. Furthermore, the risk of flooding is projected to increase, and the dry conditions over northern China are projected to be mitigated. In certain regions, particularly Southwest China, the risks of both drought and flood events would likely increase despite the decreased total precipitation in the future. Uncertainties mainly derived from inter-model and scenario variabilities are attached to these projections, but a high model agreement can be generally observed in the likelihood of these extreme changes.\n",
