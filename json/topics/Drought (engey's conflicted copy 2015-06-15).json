        "description": "\n\nThis review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently availablesatellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from aclimate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple datasets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.",

We quantify the impacts of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) on diffuse radiation and plant photosynthesis across Amazonia during 1998\u20132007. Evaluation against observed aerosol optical depth allows us to provide lower and upper BBA emissions estimates. BBA increases Amazon basin annual mean diffuse radiation by 3.4\u20136.8% and net primary production (NPP) by 1.4\u20132.8%, with quoted ranges driven by uncertainty in BBA emissions. The enhancement of Amazon basin NPP by 78\u2013156\u2009Tg\u2009C\u2009a\u22121 is equivalent to 33\u201365% of the annual regional carbon emissions from biomass burning. This NPP increase occurs during the dry season and acts to counteract some of the observed effect of drought on tropical production. We estimate that 30\u201360\u2009Tg\u2009C\u2009a\u22121 of this NPP enhancement is within woody tissue, accounting for 8\u201316% of the observed carbon sink across mature Amazonian forests.",

This study assesses the capability of microwave remote sensing in detecting soil moisture (agricultural) droughts over China and in providing early warnings. The 22\u2009year (1992\u20132013) European Space Agency satellite soil moisture retrievals are compared against the in situ observations at 312 stations in China, the global soil moisture reanalysis, and the observed rainfall deficit. Both the reanalysis and remote sensing products can only detect less than 60% of drought months at in situ station scale, but they capture the interannual variations of short-term drought area at river basin scales quite well. As compared with reanalysis, the passive and merged microwave products have better drought detection over sparsely vegetated regions in northwestern China and the active microwave product with better vegetation penetration works the best in eastern China.",

We use a hydrological model and risk assessment framework to understand the influence of temperature on the water year (WY) 2014 drought in California and examine the probability that this drought would have been less severe if temperatures resembled the historical climatology. Our results indicate that temperature played an important role in exacerbating the WY 2014 drought severity. We found that if WY 2014 temperatures resembled the 1916\u20132012 climatology, there would have been at least an 86% chance that winter snow water equivalent and spring-summer soil moisture and runoff deficits would have been less severe than the observed conditions. We also report that the temperature forecast skill in California for the important seasons of winter and spring is negligible, beyond a lead time of 1\u2009month, which we postulate might hinder skillful drought prediction in California.",

        "description": "\n\nSatellite real-time precipitation enables hydrological monitoring in China where the near-real-time ground observations are not readily available. However, the inconsistency between the real-time satellite precipitation and gauge-based retrospective data may introduce large systematic bias in near-real-time hydrological monitoring. Here we attempted to integrate the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) real-time precipitation (3B42RTV7) into a 62-year gauge-based retrospective product (IGSNRR) through matching their cumulative probability functions (CDFs) towards a near-real-time hydrological monitoring consistent with the long-term retrospective simulations. A nearly 11-year period from March 2000 to December 2010 was taken as the training period to establish the satellite-gauge precipitation relationship, which was employed in the period of 2011\u20132013 to evaluate the performance of the adjustment. The results show that the adjusted 3B42RTV7 matches well with IGSNRR precipitation while the unadjusted data tends to overestimate precipitation. Forced by the adjusted 3B42RTV7, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model can reproduce the IGSNRR-derived hydrographs and high/low flows better than the model forced by the unadjusted data. The percentiles of the adjusted hydrological estimates in the 62-year estimates from IGSNRR are used for near-real-time assessment of hydrological extremes. The hydrological monitoring assisted by the adjusted satellite precipitation, which enables the employment of the long-term ground observations, is able to capture more detailed drought information than that before adjustment. Our experiment suggests the satellite real-time precipitation, after adjustment, can generate the current hydrological conditions which can be directly compared with the long-term climatology, and thus facilitates near-real-time diagnosis and detection of hydrological extremes.",

Based on tree-ring \u03b418O from native, dominant Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. et Mey.), we developed a 300-year (1710 to 2010) standard precipitation-evaporation index (SPEI) reconstruction from January to August for China's western Tianshan Mountains. The regression model explained 37.6% of the variation in the SPEI reconstruction during the calibration period from 1950 to 2010. Comparison with previous drought reconstructions confirmed the robustness of our reconstruction. The 20th century has been a relatively wet period during the past 300 years. The SPEI showed quasi 2-, 5-, and 10-year cycles. Several pluvials and droughts with co-variability over large areas were revealed clearly in the reconstruction. The two longest pluvials (lasting for 12 years), separated by 50 years, appeared in the 1900s and the 1960s. The most severe drought occurred from 1739 to 1761, and from 1886 to 1911 was the wettest period since 1710. Compared to previous investigations of hydroclimatic changes in the western Tianshan Mountains, our reconstruction revealed more low-frequency variability and indicated that climate in the western Tianshan Mountains shifted from dry to wet in 1886. This regime shift was generally consistent with other moisture reconstructions for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and northern Pakistan, and may have resulted from a strengthened westerly circulation. The opposite hydrological trends in the western Tianshan Mountains and southeastern Tibetan Plateau reveal a substantial influence of strengthened westerlies and weakening of the Indian summer monsoon.",

Here, we review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability on the properties of different drought types. The downscaled and bias-corrected data from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) was used to produce an ensemble of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed, through a relative entropy approach and was used for drought analysis. A novel multivariate drought index known as Multivariate Drought Index (MDI) was then employed for an integrated quantification of all physical forms of drought. We studied the spatial patterns of drought properties, and performed multivariate frequency analysis for each planning region in Texas to recognize the distribution of potential drought hazard areas under climate change impact by formulating a Drought Hazard Index (DHI). A drought vulnerability assessment was also carried out by taking into consideration various socio-economic factors, leading to the development of socio-economic Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI). A set of composite drought risk maps that combines hazard and vulnerability analysis were developed. This study also explored the cause-effect relationship between the drought events and several hydro climatic triggers. A transfer entropy measure was used to quantify the causal relationships, thus indicating the predominant future drought triggers. Overall, the findings are expected to help achieve an effective drought mitigation strategy for the state of Texas.",

The simulation results show that the mean aerosol loading and optical depth over the region are 17.87\u2009mg/m2 and 0.25, respectively. Sulfate and black carbon (BC) account for approximately 61.2% and 7.8% of the total aerosols, respectively. The regional mean radiative forcing (RF) is approximately \u22123.64, \u22120.55, and +0.88\u2009W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere for the total aerosol effect, the total aerosol direct effect, and the BC direct effect, respectively. The surface direct RF of BC accounts for approximately 31% of the total RF of all aerosols. Because of the total aerosol effect, both the energy budgets and air temperature are considerably reduced in the region with high aerosol loadings, leading to decreases in the land-ocean air temperature gradient in summer. The total column-absorbed solar radiation and surface air temperature decrease by 8.4\u2009W/m2 and 0.31\u2009K, respectively. This cooling effect weakens horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulations over East Asia. The wind speed at 850\u2009hPa decreases by 0.18\u2009m/s, and the precipitation decreases by 0.29\u2009mm/d. The small responses of solar radiation, air temperature, and atmospheric circulations to the BC warming effect are opposite to those of the total aerosol effect. The BC-induced enhancement of atmospheric circulation can increase local floods in south China, while droughts in north China may worsen in response to the BC semidirect effect. The total aerosol effect is much more significant than the BC direct effect. The East Asian summer monsoon becomes weaker due to the total aerosol effect. However, this weakness could be partially offset by the BC warming effect. Sensitivity analyses further indicate that the influence of aerosols on the EASM might be more substantial in years when the southerlies or southwesterlies at 850\u2009hPa are weak compared with years when the winds are strong. Changes in the EASM can induce variations in the distribution and magnitude of aerosols. Aerosols in the lower troposphere over the region can increase by 3.07 and 1.04\u2009\u00b5g/m3 due to the total aerosol effect and the BC warming effect, respectively.",

        "description": "\nTo investigate the influence of direct radiative effect of dust on the tropical summer rain belt across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the present study utilizes the high-resolution capability of an Atmospheric General Circulation Model, the High-Resolution Atmospheric Model. Ensembles of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project style simulations have been conducted with and without dust radiative impacts, to differentiate the influence of dust on the tropical rain belt. The analysis focuses on summer season. The results highlight the role of dust-induced responses in global- and regional-scale circulations in determining the strength and the latitudinal extent of the tropical rain belt. A significant response in the strength and position of the local Hadley circulation is predicted in response to meridionally asymmetric distribution of dust and the corresponding radiative effects. Significant responses are also found in regional circulation features such as African Easterly Jet and West African Monsoon circulation. Consistent with these dynamic responses at various scales, the tropical rain belt across MENA strengthens and shifts northward. Importantly, the summer precipitation over the semiarid strip south of Sahara, including Sahel, increases up to 20%. As this region is characterized by the \u201cSahel drought,\u201d the predicted precipitation sensitivity to the dust loading over this region has a wide range of socioeconomic implications. Overall, the study demonstrates the extreme importance of incorporating dust radiative effects and the corresponding circulation responses at various scales, in the simulations and future projections of this region's climate.",

The study period (four sampling campaigns between November 2009 and November 2011) represented the end of a decade-long drought followed by several high-flow events. The hydrometry showed that the river was generally losing to the alluvium, except when storm-derived floodwaves in the river channel generated bank recharge \u2013 discharge cycles. Using 3H/14C-derived estimates of groundwater mean residence times along the transect, infiltration rates ranged from 0.6 \u2013 5 m year\u22121. However, when using the peak transition age (a more realistic estimate of travel time in highly dispersive environments), the range in infiltration rate was larger (4 \u2013 270 m year\u22121). Both river water (highest \u03b42H, \u03b418O, SF6, 3H and 14C) and an older groundwater source (lowest \u03b42H, \u03b418O, SF6, 3H, 14C and highest 4He) were found in the riparian zone. This old groundwater end-member may represent leakage from an underlying confined aquifer (Great Artesian Basin).

Given the capital intensive nature of the electric power industry, this can impact hydropower producers\u2019 ability to pay down outstanding debt, leading to credit rating downgrades, higher interests rates on new debt, and ultimately, greater infrastructure costs. One potential tool for reducing the financial exposure of hydropower producers to drought is hydrologic index insurance, in particular, contracts structured to payout when streamflows drop below a specified level. An ongoing challenge in developing this type of insurance, however, is minimizing contracts\u2019 \u201cbasis risk,\u201d that is, the degree to which contract payouts deviate in timing and/or amount from actual damages experienced by policyholders. In this paper, we show that consideration of year-to-year changes in the value of hydropower (i.e., the cost of replacing it with an alternative energy source during droughts) is critical to reducing contract basis risk. In particular, we find that volatility in the price of natural gas, a key driver of peak electricity prices, can significantly degrade the performance of index insurance unless contracts are designed to explicitly consider natural gas prices when determining payouts. Results show that a combined index whose value is derived from both seasonal streamflows and the spot price of natural gas yields contracts that exhibit both lower basis risk and greater effectiveness in terms of reducing financial exposure.\n",

However, in practice, we suspect that changing climatic conditions may affect runoff generation processes and cause changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship. In this article, we investigate whether temporary but prolonged (i.e., of the order of a decade) shifts in rainfall result in changes in rainfall-runoff relationships at the catchment scale. Annual rainfall and runoff records from south-eastern Australia are used to examine whether interdecadal climate variability induces changes in hydrological behavior. We test statistically whether annual rainfall-runoff relationships are significantly different during extended dry periods, compared with the historical norm. The results demonstrate that protracted drought led to a significant shift in the rainfall-runoff relationship in \u223c44% of the catchment-dry periods studied. The shift led to less annual runoff for a given annual rainfall, compared with the historical relationship. We explore linkages between cases where statistically significant changes occurred and potential explanatory factors, including catchment properties and characteristics of the dry period (e.g., length, precipitation anomalies). We find that long-term drought is more likely to affect transformation of rainfall to runoff in drier, flatter, and less forested catchments. Understanding changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship is important for accurate streamflow projections and to help develop adaptation strategies to deal with multiyear droughts.\n",

The objective of this study is to understand how well Coupled Model Intercomparison-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations replicate ground-based observations of continental drought areas and their trends. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble encompasses the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) ground-based observations of area under drought at all time steps. However, most model members overestimate the areas under extreme drought, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Furthermore, the results show that the time series of observations and CMIP5 simulations of areas under drought exhibit more variability in the SH than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The trend analysis of areas under drought reveals that the observational data exhibit a significant positive trend at the significance level of 0.05 over all land areas. The observed trend is reproduced by about three-fourths of the CMIP5 models when considering total land areas in drought. While models are generally consistent with observations at a global (or hemispheric) scale, most models do not agree with observed regional drying and wetting trends. Over many regions, at most 40% of the CMIP5 models are in agreement with the trends of CRU observations. The drying/wetting trends calculated using the 3 months Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values show better agreement with the corresponding CRU values than with the observed annual mean precipitation rates. Pixel-scale evaluation of CMIP5 models indicates that no single model demonstrates an overall superior performance relative to the other models.\n",

An assessment of the biases in the representation of the precipitation annual cycle was performed over the 1979\u20132008 period over five regions within SSA, based on a comparison between the GCMs precipitation outputs with the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) dataset. The multi-model ensemble well reproduces the shape of the annual cycle of precipitation over most of SSA, although the monthly totals were overestimated (underestimated) over the North-West and South (North-East and Central-East) regions. Changes in precipitation and meteorological drought characteristics were identified by the difference for early (2011\u20132040) and late (2071\u20132100) 21st century values with respect to the 1979\u20132008 baseline, using the standardized precipitation index as a short- and long-term drought indicator. Future climate conditions are expected to modify the regional characteristics of meteorological droughts over SSA, but the range of uncertainty in the expected changes is high. A significant increase in the number of drought events in all the regions for most of the 21st century sub-periods is projected for the multi-model ensemble. The mean duration of drought events will be shorter, with no significant changes in the severity of droughts and the occurrence of multi-decadal changes in the number of critical dry months is likely, although the significance in the changes depends on the region, future time horizon and greenhouse gas concentration pathways. These results overlap with a projected increase in precipitation over most of the regions, which has a strong seasonality and, therefore, will have some implications upon the future meteorological drought developments and the agricultural and hydrological practices in SSA.\n",

A non-parametric (Mann\u2013Kendall test) method was used to test for monotonic trend at each grid level, whereas the magnitude was estimated using Sen's method. Further, a field significance test was performed at major meteorological regions level to assess whether the individual trends identified could occur by chance in an analysis of large number of time series analysed. Significant (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) increasing trend of both drought duration and magnitude during the monsoon was found over parts of eastern, central and north-eastern region of India, whereas the parts of west coast, arid western region and north India showed significantly decreasing trend. The trends in mid- as well as late-season drought were contributing towards significant increase in drought condition, whereas trends in early-season drought were responsible for decrease in drought events. The time series analysis of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) illustrated that over eastern part of India the increase in drought was attributed due to decrease in rainfall, whereas the decrease in drought occurrence over western arid region was mainly because of decrease in PET.\n",

The regional differences in precipitation were analysed and compared using a data set consisting of the grades in severity of floods and droughts as derived from Chinese historical documents. The results showed that there has been no fixed spatial pattern of precipitation anomalies during either cold or warm periods in eastern China over the past 2000 years. For the most of warm periods, there existed coherence of spatial pattern with dry condition only occurred over north of the Yangtze River, and the consistent spatial patterns were found between the periods 650\u2013750 and 1190\u20131290, 650\u2013750, and 1000\u20131100.

In both regions, extensive periods of anomalously low rainfall and prolonged drought have prevailed since roughly 2008. Prior to that time, only three periods of drought are noteworthy 1998/1999, 2000, and 2005. The post-2008 drought conditions were interrupted by floods in both regions in February 2010 and in several years in the equatorial region. This rapid alternation between extremes creates additional hardships on the population. Two notable results emerge from this analysis. One is the tendency for similar trends in interannual variability in both regions, despite vastly different rainfall regimes. The other is the persistence of recent droughts through several rainy seasons. The implication of these results is that one or more factors in interannual variability is operative in all seasons. This could account for the common trends in the equatorial and summer rainfall regions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nXinjiang is the largest arid inland region in China and its agricultural development plays an important role in the socio-economy of China. Drought is one of the major natural hazards in this region and has impacts on agriculture. In this study, spatiotemporal patterns of droughts are analysed based on monthly precipitation datasets from 52 meteorological stations covering the period of 1961\u20132008 using the Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (REOF) technique and also the Mann\u2013Kendall trend test (MK test). Results of the study indicate that: (1) a wetting tendency is observed in recent years, particularly in northern Xinjiang. Seasonally, the wetting tendency is found mainly in winter. The modes of REOF can be divided by the Tianshan mountain and the principal component (PC) of the northern Xinjiang mode in winter has a significant increasing trend. (2) The area of drought-affected regions is decreasing in northwestern Xinjiang and along the northern side of Tianshan mountain. Seasonally, the area of drought-affected regions is significantly decreasing in winter. (3) The wetting tendency of Xinjiang may alleviate the drought influence. However, uneven spatial patterns of precipitation changes may enhance drought impacts. Besides, drought-related impacts can be greatly alleviated where irrigation conditions are favourable.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe study of humidity is important for better understanding the past climatic variations. However, there have been few long-term humidity reconstructions using tree-ring widths worldwide. Here, we present a June\u2013September mean relative humidity (MRH69) reconstruction from AD 1837 to 2011 using Chinese pine trees (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) from the Yiwul\u00fc Mountain region in northeastern China. The reconstruction explained 39.8% of the instrumental variance during the calibration period. We found that precipitation only influenced the MRH69 on an annual scale (high frequency), but the mean maximum temperature (MMT) impacted the MRH69 both on an annual scale (high frequency) and decadal time scale (low frequency). The MRH69 reconstruction showed a consistently increasing trend from AD 1881 to 1990, after which it diminished sharply. More high humidity years occurred after the 1960s and more low humidity years occurred before the 1960s. In the study area, MRH69 decreased along with global warming after the 1980s. On the decadal scale, there were five high-value MRH69 intervals: 1842\u20131850, 1865\u20131871, 1898\u20131902, 1823\u20131927 and 1932\u20131997; there were five low-value intervals: 1851\u20131864, 1872\u20131897, 1903\u20131922, 1928\u20131931 and 1998\u20132006. In addition, the MRH69 reconstruction showed the large-scale representativeness of sea\u2013land coupling. On the decadal scale, our MRH69 reconstruction varied synchronously with the Arctic Oscillation index (AOI), suggesting that the AOI might be linked with MRH69 in the Yiwul\u00fc Mountain region. Historical documents and meteorological data indicate that flooding (or drought) often occurred in the years with higher (or lower) humidity compared with the moving average values of the mean relative humidity (MRH).\n",

In the Czech Lands, it is reflected in significant reductions in agricultural productivity, lack of water for hygiene and industry, and impacts of forest management. Mean monthly temperature and precipitation series created for the Czech Lands for 1805\u20132012 were used to calculate spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) drought indices (SPI-1, SPI-12, SPEI-1, SPEI-12, Z-index and PDSI), which were then used for further analyses. Fluctuations in drought indices demonstrate an increasing long-term dryness in the Czech climate, statistically significant for SPEI-12 and PDSI in MAM and JJA (in MAM as well for SPEI-1 and Z-index). A significant concentration of drought episodes before 1880 may be attributed to a lack of precipitation, whereas the droughts of recent decades (particularly 2004\u20132012) are more strongly related to high temperatures. The effects of droughts are reflected in significant reductions in winter wheat and spring barley yields in the eastern province of Moravia. Regression analysis of drought forcings discloses the importance of the North Atlantic Oscillation phase and the aggregate effect of anthropogenic forcing (driven largely by increases in CO2 concentration). Their magnitude of influence varies strongly with the type of drought index and season of the year. Other factors, such as solar irradiation and the Southern Oscillation phase make only minor contributions to drought variability. The effects of volcanic activity and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are even weaker and statistically insignificant.\n",

Identification of homogeneous rainfall zones to better analyse the rainfall intensity and extent is of vital significance for water resources management and mitigation of potential hazards from extreme events, i.e. droughts and floods. Appropriate zoning of homogeneous rainfall regions may give better understanding of rainfall patterns by resolving small scale variations. Although homogeneous rainfall zones have been established at country scale based on climatological mean behaviour, there has been little attempt to identify zones over broader scale with consistently homogeneous rainfall variability. This study employed K-means and Hierarchical clustering methods to establish homogeneous rainfall zones in the East Asia monsoon region (20\u00b0N\u201350\u00b0N, 103\u00b0E\u2013149\u00b0E) using 30 years (1978\u20132007) monthly rainfall data at 0.5\u00b0 grid resolution. Various cluster validation indices were used to assess the optimal number of homogeneous rainfall zones. The comparison of K-means and Hierarchical clustering showed that although both methods were able to define the homogeneous rainfall zones well with spatial contiguity, the K-means clustering outperformed the Hierarchical clustering in identifying more distinct zones with diverse rainfall characteristics. Mann-Kendall and linear regression tests were used for seasonal and annual rainfall trend analysis in the homogeneous rainfall zones. The study revealed that the region experiences distinct rainfall regimes over different zones. Furthermore, significant increasing and decreasing trends were observed over different zones with strong seasonal variation that indicate the aggravated stress of climate induced disasters, i.e. droughts and floods over the East Asia monsoon region.\n",

By doing so, the relatively new procedure known as empirical orthogonal teleconnection analysis (EOT) was validated as an effective way for identifying the impact of atmospheric patterns in remote oceanic basins on rainfall trends at a particular location. Rainfall trends were investigated, and trend analysis on optimally interpolated rain gauge data (1948\u20132013) shows no significant decrease for kiremt rainfall (June\u2013September) in North Ethiopia. However, EOT analysis of assimilated mean sea level pressure data reveals that not only El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)/La Ni\u00f1a, but also the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) has a significant impact in North Ethiopia. Including the variability of the Southwest Monsoons (SWM), subsequent multivariate regression could model North Ethiopian kiremt rainfall from these three teleconnections (R2 = 0.64), representing 89% of all dry years. In particular, the interaction between these three teleconnections was a major contributor to the 1983\u20131985 droughts and famine. The study hence finds a significant impact of three atmospheric teleconnections (ENSO, IOD, SWM) on North Ethiopian rainfall variability. Moreover, it is pointed out that EOT analysis is a useful tool to identify the relations between drought risk and remote atmospheric systems.\n",

        "description": "\n\nSummer precipitation over most of the tropical Americas exhibits maxima in June and September, and a relative minimum in July. The minimum in summer precipitation over the northeastern (NE) tropical Pacific is known as the midsummer drought (MSD). Several theories have been put forward to explain the origin of the MSD, but most of them fail at addressing simultaneously the various elements that characterize it. The temporal evolution of summer precipitation over the NE tropical Pacific warm pool and over the Intra-Americas Seas (IAS) is related, but not the result of the same process. Over the NE Pacific warm pool, the temporal evolution of convective activity is closely related to sea surface temperature (SST) variations, whereas over the IAS, the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) with maximum intensity in July appears to be the key factor. The CLLJ produces \u2018gap flow\u2019 over Central America that reaches the NE tropical Pacific and stronger easterly winds. This low-level flow leads to a decrease in SSTs and a westward shift of low-level moisture convergence that combined with subsidence result in the MSD. At the CLLJ exit region, intense tropical convection enhances during July reducing the chances that large-scale circulations, such as the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) inhibit precipitation over the entire tropical Americas. The strong ascending motion off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica contributes to enhanced subsidence in the surrounding regions and to the MSD. As the CLLJ and tropical convection in the western Caribbean weaken during August and September, tropical convection increases once more over most of the tropical Americas and produces the second maximum in precipitation that completes the two peaks distribution of summer precipitation. Therefore, the fluctuations in the intensity of the CLLJ appear to be a key dynamical element to explain the MSD.\n",

The ASWI is significantly correlated with the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel in the 1900\u20132013 period (r\u2009=\u2009+0.57, r\u2009=\u2009+0.66 and r\u2009=\u2009+0.53 for July, August and September respectively). By using historical wind direction measurements it has been possible to compute the ASWI back to 1790 for July and to 1839 for August and September, thus providing the first instrumental record of the West African Monsoon strength for a large portion of the 19th century.\nSince the 1970s, the Sahel has experienced a strong and persistent drought. During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel. Notwithstanding, two of the few dry years within this period were concurrent with large volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere. This latter result supports the recently described relationship between major volcanic eruptions and the occurrence of isolated drought episodes in the Sahel.\n",

Global warming and effects of anthropogenic aerosols have both been proposed as possible causes of these changes. We examine data from urban and rural meteorological stations in eastern China (1955\u20132011) and compare them with Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data (1979\u20132007) and reanalysis data in various latitude zones to study changes in precipitation extremes. Significant decreases in light precipitation and increases in heavy precipitation are found at both rural and urban stations, as well as low latitudes over the ocean, while total precipitation shows little change. Characteristics of these changes and changes in the equatorial zone and other latitudes suggest that global warming rather than aerosol effects is the primary cause of the changes. In eastern China, increases of annual total dry days (28 days) and \u226510 consecutive dry days (36%) are due to the decrease in light precipitation days, thereby establishing a causal link among global warming, changes in precipitation extremes, and higher meteorological risk of floods and droughts. Further, results derived from the GPCP data and reanalysis data suggest that the causal link exists over widespread regions of the globe.</p>\n                  ",

Y. Maezumi, M. J. Power, F. E. Mayle, K. K. McLauchlan, and J. Iriarte<br /><br />Cerr\u00e3do savannas have the greatest fire activity of all major global land-cover\ntypes and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. During the\n21st century, temperatures are projected to increase by ~ 3 \u00b0C coupled with a precipitation decrease of\n~ 20%. Although these conditions could potentially\nintensify drought stress, it is unknown how that might alter vegetation\ncomposition and fire regimes. To assess how Neotropical savannas responded\nto past climate changes, a 14 500-year, high-resolution, sedimentary record\nfrom Huanchaca Mesetta, a palm swamp located in the cerr\u00e3do savanna in northeastern\nBolivia, was analyzed with phytoliths, stable isotopes, and charcoal. A\nnon-analogue, cold-adapted vegetation community dominated the\nLateglacial\u2013early Holocene period (14 500\u20139000 cal yr BP, which included trees and\nC<sub>3</sub> Pooideae and C<sub>4</sub> Panicoideae grasses. The Lateglacial\nvegetation was fire-sensitive and fire activity during this period was low,\nlikely responding to fuel availability and limitation. Although similar\nvegetation characterized the early Holocene, the warming conditions\nassociated with the onset of the Holocene led to an initial increase in fire\nactivity. Huanchaca Mesetta became increasingly fire-dependent during the\nmiddle Holocene with the expansion of C<sub>4</sub> fire-adapted grasses. However,\nas warm, dry conditions, characterized by increased length and severity of\nthe dry season, continued, fuel availability decreased. The establishment of\nthe modern palm swamp vegetation occurred at 5000 cal yr BP. Edaphic factors\nare the first-order control on vegetation on the rocky quartzite mesetta.\nWhere soils are sufficiently thick, climate is the second-order control of\nvegetation on the mesetta. The presence of the modern palm swamp is\nattributed to two factors: (1) increased precipitation that increased water\ntable levels and (2) decreased frequency and duration of <i>surazos</i> (cold wind\nincursions from Patagonia) leading to increased temperature minima. Natural\n(soil, climate, fire) drivers rather than anthropogenic drivers control the\nvegetation and fire activity at Huanchaca Mesetta. Thus the cerr\u00e3do savanna\necosystem of the Huanchaca Plateau has exhibited ecosystem resilience to\nmajor climatic changes in both temperature and precipitation since the\nLateglacial period.",

Therefore,\naccurate reconstructions of past vegetation and hydrological changes are\ncrucial for a better understanding of climate variability in the tropical\nsoutheastern African region. We present high-resolution pollen records from\na marine sediment core recovered offshore of the Rufiji River delta. Our data\ndocument significant shifts in pollen assemblages during the last\ndeglaciation, identifying, through changes in both upland and\nlowland vegetation, specific responses of plant communities to atmospheric\n(precipitation) and coastal (coastal dynamics and sea-level changes)\nalterations. Specifically, arid conditions reflected by a maximum pollen\nrepresentation of dry and open vegetation occurred during the Northern\nHemisphere cold Heinrich event 1 (H1), suggesting that the expansion of drier\nupland vegetation was synchronous with cold Northern Hemisphere\nconditions. This arid period is followed by an interval in which forest and\nhumid woodlands expanded, indicating a hydrologic shift towards more humid\nconditions. Droughts during H1 and the shift to humid conditions around 14.8 kyr BP in the uplands are consistent with latitudinal shifts of the\nintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude Northern\nHemisphere climatic fluctuations. Additionally, our results show that the\nlowland vegetation, consisting of well-developed salt marshes and mangroves\nin a successional pattern typical for vegetation occurring in intertidal\nhabitats, has responded mainly to local coastal dynamics related to marine\ninundation frequencies and soil salinity in the Rufiji Delta as well as to the\nlocal moisture availability. Lowland vegetation shows a substantial\nexpansion of mangrove trees after ~ 14.8 kyr BP, suggesting an\nincreased moisture availability and river runoff in the coastal area.

The seasonal forecasts were also\nbias-corrected with the EGPCP using quantile mapping as well as\npost-processed using a precipitation threshold to define a dry day. The\nresults indicate that the forecasts show skill in predicting dry spells in\ncomparison with a climatological ensemble based on previous years.

The Ard\u00e8che catchment (Southeast France), typical of\nthis environment, is chosen to explore the following questions: (1) can such\na Mediterranean catchment be adequately characterized by a simple dynamical\nsystems approach and what are the limits of the method under such\nconditions? (2) what information about dominant predictors of hydrological\nvariability can be retrieved from this analysis in such catchments?\n<br><br>\nIn this work we apply the data-driven approach of Kirchner (2009) to\nestimate discharge sensitivity functions that summarize the behaviour of four\nsub-catchments of the Ard\u00e8che, using low-vegetation periods\n(November\u2013March) from 9 years of measurements (2000\u20132008) from operational\nnetworks. The relevance of the inferred sensitivity function is assessed\nthrough hydrograph simulations, and through estimating precipitation rates\nfrom discharge fluctuations. We find that the discharge sensitivity function\nis downward-curving in double-logarithmic space, thus allowing further\nsimulation of discharge and non-divergence of the model, only during\nlow-vegetation periods. The analysis is complemented by a Monte Carlo\nsensitivity analysis showing how the parameters summarizing the discharge\nsensitivity function impact the simulated hydrographs. The resulting\ndischarge simulation results are good for granite catchments, which are\nlikely to be characterized by shallow subsurface flow at the interface\nbetween soil and bedrock. The simple dynamical system hypothesis works\nespecially well in wet conditions (peaks and recessions are well modelled).\nOn the other hand, poor model performance is associated with summer and dry\nperiods when evapotranspiration is high and low-flow discharge observations\nare inaccurate. In the Ard\u00e8che catchment, inferred precipitation rates\nagree well in timing and amount with observed gauging stations and SAFRAN\nclimatic data reanalysis during the low-vegetation periods. The model should\nfurther be improved to include a more accurate representation of actual\nevapotranspiration, but provides a satisfying summary of the catchment\nfunctioning during wet and winter periods.",

March, M. Hern\u00e1ndez, and D. Saur\u00ed<br /><br />The design of water awareness campaigns could benefit from knowledge of the\nspecific characteristics of domestic water use and the factors that may\ninfluence certain water consumption habits. This paper investigates water\nuse in 450 households in 10 municipalities of drought-prone Alicante\n(Spain). We aim to increase knowledge about existing domestic water\nbehaviors and therefore help to improve the design and implementation of\nfuture water awareness campaigns and even to consolidate reductions in water\nuse after drought periods. The survey suggests that awareness campaigns\nshould revise their scope and their channels of\ndiffusion on a regular basis. In a more specific way, for the Alicante case we propose\npolicy-oriented recommendations on the scope of action for further reductions.",

        "description": "\nOne of the goals of climate scientists is to understand how climate shifts may have changed the course of history and influenced culture at millennial timescales. Repeatedly, environmental degradation has upset the balance between people, their habitat, and the socioeconomic frameworks in which they live. Among these imbalances, drought, firmly rooted in people's minds as a catalyst of harvest failures and famines, remains a permanent threat because it may trigger or amplify social crises, leading to massive exoduses, conflicts, and political turmoil. The spiral of decline in which the flourishing Eastern Mediterranean civilizations were plunged 3200 years ago, and the ensuing chaos, remains a persistent riddle in Near Eastern history. Scholars tend to believe that this socioeconomic collapse was violent and culturally disruptive. Most of the coastal cities between Pylos and Gaza were destroyed, burned, and often left unoccupied, thereafter, putting an end to the elaborate network of international trade that ensured prosperity in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The rural settlements that emerged have mainly persisted through adapted agropastoral activities and limited long-distance trade. At the dusk of this event, regional cultures began to be poorly documented, leading historians to allude to a dark age that lasted for 300 years. Among the roots, tectonic instability and earthquakes, demographic imbalance between social groups, internal collapses, and technological innovations are commonly evoked. However, recent studies have mainly hypothesized about an impact of a centuries-long drought behind the decline. Drought may have hastened the fall of the Old World by sparking famine, invasions, and conflicts, leading to the political, economic, and cultural chaos termed \u2018Late Bronze Age collapse\u2019.
