        "description": "\n\nWater vapor in the lower stratosphere exhibits localized maximum values during Northern Hemisphere summer in the Asian and North American (NA) monsoon regions. The processes maintaining these maxima are not well understood. We analyze the variability of water vapor in the monsoon regions based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations during 2005\u20132013, and quantify links to deep convection, large-scale temperatures and monsoonal circulations. Strong sub-seasonal variations in stratospheric water vapor are closely linked with deep convection in the monsoon regions, with the surprising result that stronger convection leads to a relatively dry stratosphere and weaker convection to a wetter stratosphere. This result is observed for both the Asian and NA monsoon regions. This behavior is explained by temperature changes in the stratosphere tied to deep convection: stronger convection leads to relatively cold temperatures in the subtropical lower stratosphere, which is the key region controlling large-scale dehydration within the anticyclonic monsoonal circulations. Likewise, weaker convection leads to warmer subtropical stratospheric temperatures, relatively less dehydration and enhanced water vapor. The observed water vapor changes are in approximate agreement with those expected from the subtropical temperature variations, taking into account dilution of the dehydrated air into the larger monsoon region. These results demonstrate that stratospheric water vapor in the NH monsoon regions is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation and temperatures, and overshooting deep convection plays a relatively minor role.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe mean North American and world climates have warmed since the 19th century following the anthropogenic emission of large quantities of greenhouse gases. It has been suggested that this warming may increase the frequency or severity of droughts. We define a quantitative and objective aridity index that describes the precipitation forcing function of drought. Using the extensive historical database of precipitation records, we evaluate changes in the aridity in the 48 contiguous United States. The area-averaged mean fractional rate of change of aridity of 1218 sites in the period 1893\u20132013 was (\u22126.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20094 per year; the 48 contiguous United States became less arid. The rate of decrease of aridity was roughly consistent with expectations from the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation and the rate of warming. The fractional rate of change of aridity was nearly uncorrelated with the aridity itself, but there were regional differences: many Western and coastal Southeastern sites showed increasing aridity, but regions of rapidly decreasing aridity were found in a band 85\u2218\u2013100\u2218W and the Northeast.\n",

Nikonovas, P. R. J. North, and S. H. Doerr<br /><br />Particulate emissions from wildfires impact human health and have a large but\nuncertain effect on climate. Modelling schemes depend on information about\nemission factors, emitted particle microphysical and optical properties and\nageing effects, while satellite retrieval algorithms make use of\ncharacteristic aerosol models to improve retrieval. Ground-based remote\nsensing provides detailed aerosol characterisation, but does not contain\ninformation on source. Here, a method is presented to estimate plume origin\nland cover type and age for AERONET aerosol observations, employing\ntrajectory modelling using the HYSPLIT model, and satellite active fire and\naerosol optical thickness (AOT) observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) and Along Track Scanning Radiometer\n(AATSR). It is applied to AERONET stations located in or near northern\ntemperate and boreal forests for the period 2002\u20132013. The results from 629\nfire attributions indicate significant differences in size distributions and\nparticle optical properties between different land cover types and plume age.\nSmallest fine mode median radius (<i>R</i><sub>fv</sub>) are attributed to plumes\nfrom cropland and/or natural vegetation mosaic (0.143 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>) and\ngrassland (0.157 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>) fires. North American evergreen needleleaf\nforest emissions show a significantly smaller <i>R</i><sub>fv</sub>\n(0.164 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>) than plumes from Eurasian mixed forests\n(0.193 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>) and plumes attributed to the land cover types with\nsparse tree cover \u2013 open shrubland (0.185 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>) and woody savannas\n(0.184 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr>). The differences in size distributions are related to\ninferred variability in plume concentrations between the land cover types.\nSignificant differences are observed between day and night emissions, with\ndaytime emissions showing larger particle sizes. Smoke is predominantly\nscattering for all of the classes with median single scattering albedo at\n440 nm (SSA(440)) values close to 0.95 except the cropland emissions\nwhich have an SSA(440) value of 0.9. Plumes aged for 4 days or older\nhave median <i>R</i><sub>fv</sub> larger by ~0.02 <abbr>\u03bcm</abbr> compared\nto young smoke. Differences in size were consistent with a decrease in the\n\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Exponent and increase in the asymmetry parameter. Only an\ninsignificant increase in SSA(\u03bb) with ageing was found.",

In this study, the prevalence, sources, and optical importance\nof this so-called brown carbon (BrC) aerosol component are investigated\nthroughout the North American continental tropospheric column during a\nsummer of extensive biomass burning. Spectrophotometric absorption\nmeasurements on extracts of bulk aerosol samples collected from an aircraft\nover the central USA were analyzed to directly quantify BrC abundance. BrC\nwas found to be prevalent throughout the 1 to 12 km altitude measurement\nrange, with dramatic enhancements in biomass-burning plumes. BrC to black carbon (BC) ratios, under background tropospheric conditions, increased with\naltitude, consistent with a corresponding increase in the absorption \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AAE) determined from a three-wavelength particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP). The sum of inferred BC absorption and measured\nBrC absorption at 365 nm was within 3 % of the measured PSAP absorption\nfor background conditions and 22 % for biomass burning. A radiative\ntransfer model showed that BrC absorption reduced top-of-atmosphere (TOA) aerosol\nforcing by ~ 20 % in the background troposphere. Extensive\nradiative model simulations applying this study background tropospheric\nconditions provided a look-up chart for determining radiative forcing\nefficiencies of BrC as a function of a surface-measured BrC : BC ratio and\nsingle scattering albedo (SSA). The chart is a first attempt to provide a\ntool for better assessment of brown carbon's forcing effect when one is\nlimited to only surface data. These results indicate that BrC is an\nimportant contributor to direct aerosol radiative forcing.",

Following the Part 1\npaper that focuses on the evaluation of the 2006 simulations, this Part 2\npaper focuses on a comparison of model performance in 2006 and 2010 as well as\nanalysis of the responses of air quality and meteorology\u2013chemistry\ninteractions to changes in emissions and meteorology from 2006 to 2010. In\ngeneral, emissions for gaseous and aerosol species decrease from 2006 to\n2010, leading to a reduction in gaseous and aerosol concentrations and\nassociated changes in radiation and cloud variables due to various feedback\nmechanisms. WRF/Chem is able to reproduce most observations and the observed\nvariation trends from 2006 to 2010, despite its slightly worse performance\nthan WRF that is likely due to inaccurate chemistry feedbacks resulting from\nless accurate emissions and chemical boundary conditions (BCONs) in 2010.\nCompared to 2006, the performance for most meteorological variables in 2010\ngives lower normalized mean biases but higher normalized mean errors and\nlower correlation coefficients. The model also shows poorer performance for\nmost chemical variables in 2010. This could be attributed to\nunderestimations in emissions of some species, such as primary organic\naerosol in some areas of the US in 2010, and inaccurate chemical BCONs and\nmeteorological predictions. The inclusion of chemical feedbacks in WRF/Chem\nreduces biases in meteorological predictions in 2010; however, it increases\nerrors and weakens correlations comparing to WRF simulations. Sensitivity\nsimulations show that the net changes in meteorological variables from 2006\nto 2010 are mostly influenced by changes in meteorology and those of ozone\nand fine particulate matter are influenced to a large extent by emissions\nand/or chemical BCONs and to a lesser extent by changes in meteorology.\nUsing a different set of emissions and/or chemical BCONs helps   improve the\nperformance of individual variables, although it does not improve the degree\nof agreement with observed interannual trends. These results indicate a\nneed to further improve the accuracy and consistency of emissions and\nchemical BCONs, the representations of SOA and chemistry\u2013meteorology\nfeedbacks in the online-coupled models.",

The models simulate periods with in-phase seasonal precipitation anomalies but the strength of this relationship is variable on multi-decadal timescales, behavior that is also exhibited by the reconstructions. The models, however, are unable to simulate periods with consistently out-of-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies as observed in the latter part of the instrumental interval. The periods with predominantly in-phase winter-to-summer precipitation anomalies in the models are significant against randomness, and while this result is suggestive of a potential for dual-season drought on interannual and longer timescales, models do not consistently exhibit the persistent dual-season drought seen in the dendroclimatic reconstructions. These collective findings indicate that model-derived drought risk assessments may underestimate the potential for dual-season drought in 21st-century projections of hydroclimate in the American Southwest and parts of Mexico.\n",

The variability in surface chlorophyll is complex. Whereas the spring bloom generates the highest phytoplankton concentration for coastal Alaska, the north and east coasts of Haida Gwaii, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and coastal Oregon and California, it is the fall bloom that normally generates the highest concentration for the west coast of Vancouver Island, Juan de Fuca Strait, and the west coast of Washington. The highest satellite-sensed chlorophyll concentrations occur in the Strait of Georgia, where mean values are at least 2 times higher than elsewhere in the northeast Pacific. Moreover, the annual average surface chlorophyll concentration increased significantly in the Strait of Georgia during this period, with highest concentration observed during the near neutral ENSO conditions of the spring of 2007. The next highest concentrations occur off southwest Vancouver Island but have no statistically significant trend. The lowest average peak chlorophyll concentration is observed off Southern California. The timing of the highest chlorophyll concentration is latest off the coast of Washington and earliest off the coast of Southern California. Small increasing concentration trends are observed off the Washington and California coasts.\n",

We evaluate WRF model performance for a historical simulation and future projections, applying the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) as initial and boundary conditions with and without a bias correction. WRF simulations using boundary and initial conditions from both versions of CCSM4 show smaller biases versus evaluation data sets than does CCSM4 over western North America. WRF simulations also improve spatial details of precipitation over much of North America. However, driving the WRF with the bias-corrected CCSM4 does not always reduce the bias. WRF-projected changes in precipitation include decreasing intensity over the U.S. Southwest, increasing intensity over the eastern United Sates and most of Canada, and an increase in the number of days with heavy precipitation over much of North America. Projected precipitation changes are more evident in the late 21st century than the mid 21st century, and they are more evident under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5 in the late 21st century. Uncertainties in the projected changes in precipitation due to different warming scenarios are non-negligible.

Wissm\u00fcller<br /><br />Vertically resolved distributions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) with\n      global coverage in the height region from the upper troposphere to\n      ~20 km altitude have been derived from observations by\n      the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS)\n      on Envisat for the period July 2002 to April 2012. Retrieved volume\n      mixing ratio profiles representing single measurements are\n      characterized by typical errors in the range of 70\u2013100 pptv\n      and by a vertical resolution ranging from 3 to 5 km. Comparison\n      with  observations by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) revealed a slightly varying bias with\n      altitude of \u221220 to 50 pptv for the MIPAS data set in case of\n      volcanically enhanced concentrations. For background concentrations\n      the comparison showed a systematic difference between the two major\n      MIPAS observation periods. After debiasing, the difference could be\n      reduced to biases within \u221210 to 20 pptv in the altitude\n      range of 10\u201320 km with respect to ACE-FTS. Further\n      comparisons of the debiased MIPAS data set with in situ measurements\n      from various aircraft campaigns showed no obvious inconsistencies\n      within a range of around \u00b150 pptv. The SO<sub>2</sub>\n      emissions of more than 30 volcanic eruptions could be identified\n      in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Emitted\n      SO<sub>2</sub> masses and lifetimes within different altitude ranges in\n      the UTLS have been derived for a large part of these eruptions. Masses\n      are in most cases within estimations derived from other\n      instruments. From three of the major eruptions within the MIPAS\n      measurement period \u2013 Kasatochi in August 2008, Sarychev in June 2009\n      and Nabro in June 2011 \u2013 derived lifetimes of SO<sub>2</sub> for the\n      altitude ranges 10\u201314, 14\u201318 and\n      18\u201322 km are 13.3 \u00b1 2.1, 23.6 \u00b1 1.2 and  32.3 \u00b1 5.5 days respectively. By omitting\n      periods with obvious volcanic influence we have derived background\n      mixing ratio distributions of SO<sub>2</sub>. At 10 km altitude\n      these indicate an annual cycle at northern mid- and high latitudes\n      with maximum values in summer and an amplitude of about\n      30 pptv. At higher altitudes of about 16\u201318 km,\n      enhanced mixing ratios of SO<sub>2</sub> can be found in the regions of\n      the Asian and the North American monsoons in summer \u2013 a possible\n      connection to an aerosol layer discovered by Vernier et al.

Data were\ncollected over a period of 2 years (2012\u20132014) in central Tucson, Arizona: a\nsignificant urban area surrounded by a sparsely populated desert. Average CCN\nconcentrations are typically lowest in spring (233 cm<sup>\u22123</sup>), highest in\nwinter (430 cm<sup>\u22123</sup>) and have a secondary peak during the North American\nmonsoon season (July to September; 372 cm<sup>\u22123</sup>). There is significant\nvariability outside of seasonal patterns, with extreme concentrations (1 and\n99 % levels) ranging from 56 to 1945 cm<sup>\u22123</sup> as measured during the\nwinter, the season with highest variability.\n<br><br>\nModeled CCN concentrations based on fixed chemical composition achieve better\nclosure in winter, with size and number alone able to predict 82 % of the\nvariance in CCN concentration. Changes in aerosol chemical composition are\ntypically aligned with changes in size and aerosol number, such that\nhygroscopicity can be parameterized even though it is still variable. In\nsummer, models based on fixed chemical composition explain at best only\n41 % (pre-monsoon) and 36 % (monsoon) of the variance. This is\nattributed to the effects of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production, the\ncompetition between new particle formation and condensational growth, the\ncomplex interaction of meteorology, regional and local emissions and\nmulti-phase chemistry during the North American monsoon. Chemical composition\nis found to be an important factor for improving predictability in spring and\non longer timescales in winter.\n<br><br>\nParameterized models typically exhibit improved predictive skill when there\nare strong relationships between CCN concentrations and the prevailing\nmeteorology and dominant aerosol physicochemical processes, suggesting that\nsimilar findings could be possible in other locations with comparable\nclimates and geography.",

Zanchettin, O. Bothe, F. Lehner, P. Ortega, C. C. Raible, and D.

Here, we\nillustrate the contrast between an interdecadal strong positive phase of the\nwinter Pacific/North American pattern (PNA) in the early 19th century\nthat is described by a PNA reconstruction based on tree rings from\nnorthwestern North America, and a slight tendency towards negative winter\nPNA anomalies during the same period in an ensemble of state-of-the-art\ncoupled climate simulations. Additionally, a pseudo-proxy investigation with\nthe same simulation ensemble allows for assessing the robustness of PNA\nreconstructions using solely geophysical predictors from northwestern North\nAmerica for the last millennium. The reconstructed early 19th-century\npositive PNA anomaly emerges as a potentially reliable feature, although the\npseudo-reconstructions are subject to a number of sources of uncertainty and\ndeficiencies highlighted especially at multidecadal and centennial\ntimescales. The pseudo-reconstructions demonstrate that the\nearly 19th-century discrepancy between reconstructed and simulated PNA\ndoes not stem from the reconstruction process. Instead, reconstructed and\nsimulated features of the early 19th-century PNA can be reconciled by\ninterpreting the reconstructed evolution during this time as an expression\nof internal climate variability, which is unlikely to be reproduced in its\nexact temporal occurrence by a small ensemble of climate simulations.\nHowever, firm attribution of the reconstructed PNA anomaly is hampered by\nknown limitations and deficiencies of coupled climate models and\nuncertainties in the early 19th-century external forcing and background\nclimate state.",

Honrath<br /><br />Measurements of atmospheric nitrogen oxides NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>\n(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> = NO + NO<sub>2</sub>), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), NO<sub><i>y</i></sub>,\nand non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) were taken at the Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit) station,\nGreenland (72.34\u00b0 N, 38.29\u00b0 W; 3212 m a.s.l.), from\nJuly 2008 to July 2010. The data set represents the first year-round\nconcurrent record of these compounds sampled at a high latitude Arctic site.\nHere, the study focused on the seasonal variability of these important ozone\n(O<sub>3</sub>) precursors in the Arctic troposphere and the impact from transported\nanthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. Our analysis shows that PAN is\nthe dominant NO<sub><i>y</i></sub> species in all seasons at Summit, varying from 42 to\n76 %; however, we find that odd NO<sub><i>y</i></sub> species (odd\nNO<sub><i>y</i></sub> = NO<sub><i>y</i></sub> &minus; PAN &minus; NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) contribute a large\namount to the total NO<sub><i>y</i></sub> speciation. We hypothesize that the source of this\nodd NO<sub><i>y</i></sub> is most likely alkyl nitrates and nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) from\ntransported pollution, and photochemically produced species such as nitrous acid (HONO).\n<br><br>\nFLEXPART retroplume analyses and black carbon (BC) tracers for anthropogenic\nand biomass burning (BB) emissions were used to identify periods when the\nsite was impacted by polluted air masses. Europe contributed the largest\nsource of anthropogenic emissions during the winter months (November\u2013March)\nwith 56 % of the total anthropogenic BC tracer originating from Europe in\n2008\u20132009 and 69 % in 2009\u20132010.

Enhancements in O<sub>3</sub> precursors during the second\nwinter were typically higher, which may be attributed to the increase in\nEuropean polluted air masses transported to Summit in 2009\u20132010 compared to\n2008\u20132009.

        "description": "\n\nWith a warming climate, understanding the physical dynamics of hot and cold extreme events has taken on increased importance for public health, infrastructure, ecosystems, food security and other domains. Here, we use a high resolution spatial and temporal seamless gridded land surface forcing dataset to provide an assessment of recent spatio-temporal patterns in temperature extremes over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We asked: 1) How are temperature extremes changing across the different regions of CONUS? 2) How do changes in extremes vary on seasonal, annual and decadal scales? 3) How do changes in extremes relate to changes in mean conditions? and 4) Do extremes relate to major modes of ocean\u2013atmosphere variability? We derive a subset of the CLIMDEX extreme indices from the North American Land Data Assimilation phase 2 forcing dataset. While there were warming trends in all indices, daytime temperature extremes warmed more than nighttime. Spring warming was the strongest and most extensive across CONUS, and summer experienced the strongest and most extensive decrease in cold extremes. Increase in winter warm extremes appeared weakening relative to the rapid 1950\u20131990 increase found in previous studies. The Northeast and Midwest experienced the most warming, while the Northwest and North Great Plains saw the least. We found changes in average temperatures were more associated with changes in cold extremes than warm extremes. Since 2006 there have been 5 years when more than 5% of the U.S. experienced at least 90 warm days, something not observed in the previous 25 years. The unusually warm first decade of 21st century could have been associated with the warm conditions of near ENSO-neutral phase of the decade, and possibly amplified by anthropogenic forcing. The widespread, lengthy, and severe extreme hot events documented here during the past three decades underscore the need to implement thoughtful adaptation plans in the very near future, to the growing evidence of increasing warm extremes across United States.\n",

Understanding its response to rainfall variability requires consideration of multiple time scales. We examine intra-annual to multiyear relationships using model simulations of soil moisture and vegetation growth over 50 years in the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California (USA). Ecohydrological model parameters are conditioned on field and remote sensing data using an ensemble Kalman filter. Although no specific periodicities were detected in the rainfall record, simulated leaf-area-index exhibits multiyear dynamics that are driven by multiyear (\u223c3 years) rains, but with up to a 1 year delay in peak response. Within a multiyear period, Larrea tridentata is more sensitive to winter rains than summer. In the most active part of the root zone (above \u223c80 cm), >1 year average soil moisture drives vegetation growth, but monthly average soil moisture is controlled by root uptake. Moisture inputs reach the lower part of the root zone (below \u223c80 cm) infrequently, but once there they can persist over a year to help sustain plant growth. Parameter estimates highlight efficient plant physiological properties facilitating persistent growth and high soil hydraulic conductivity allowing deep soil moisture stores. We show that soil moisture as an ecological indicator is complicated by bidirectional interactions with vegetation that depend on time scale and depth. Under changing climate, Larrea tridentata will likely be relatively resilient to shorter-term moisture variability but will exhibit higher sensitivity to shifts in seasonal to multiyear moisture inputs.\n",

All RCMs (RCA3.5, HadGEM3-RA, REMO, and RegCM4) were forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Model precipitation was compared against several observational gridded data sets at different time scales. Most RCMs capture well the annual cycle of precipitation and outperform ERA-Interim, which is drier than the observations. RCMs underestimate (overestimate) the precipitation over the coastal plains (mountains) and have some problems to reproduce the interannual variability of the monsoon. To further investigate this, two extreme summers that showed the largest consistency among observations and RCMs were chosen: one wet (1990) and one dry (2005). The impact of the passage of tropical cyclones, the size of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position, and the initial intensity of the land\u2013sea thermal contrast (LSTC) were analysed. During the wet year, the LSTC was stronger than the 2005 dry monsoon season and there were a larger number of hurricanes near the Gulf of California, the WHWP was more extended, and the ITCZ was located in a more northerly position than in 2005. All these processes contributed to a wetter NAM season. During the dry year, the LSTC was weaker, with a later onset, probably due to a previous very wet winter. The inverse precipitation relationship between winter and summer in the monsoon region was well captured by most of the RCMs. RegCM4 showed the largest biases and HadGEM3-RA the smallest ones.\n",

A weak AMOC and its associated reduced northward oceanic heat transport are associated with a cooling of the ENA Ocean, whereas the TNA cooling is attributable to both weak AMOC and surface heat flux. The cold biases in the ENA and TNA have remote impacts on the SST bias in the North Pacific. Here we use coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments to show the mechanisms and pathways by which the ENA and TNA affect the North Pacific. The model simulations demonstrate that the cooling SST bias in the North Pacific is largely due to the remote effect of the cooling SST bias in the ENA, while the remote impact of the TNA cooling SST bias is of secondary importance. The ENA cooling bias triggers the circumglobal teleconnection via the Northern Hemisphere annular mode, producing a strengthening of the Aleutian low, an enhancement of the southward Ekman and Oyashio cold advection, and thus a cooling SST in the North Pacific. In contrast, the TNA cooling produces a surface high extending to the eastern tropical North Pacific, inducing the northeasterly wind anomalies north, northerly cross-equatorial wind anomalies, and northwesterly wind anomalies south of the equator. This C-shape wind anomaly pattern generates an SST warming in the tropical southeastern Pacific, which eventually leads to an SST warming in the tropical central and western Pacific by the wind-evaporation-SST feedback. The tropical Pacific warming in turn leads to an SST cooling in the North Pacific by the Pacific North American teleconnection pattern.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe 2013\u20132014 winter in North America brought intense drought in the West and severe cold in the East. The circulation anomalies were characterized as a dipole: an amplified upper-level ridge over the West Coast and a deepened trough over the central-eastern United States. A previous study using a single model has linked the dipole to the El Ni\u00f1o precursor and found that this link has strengthened in recent years. Here, 17 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 are used to examine the dipole activity. Most models capture the dipole and its association with El Ni\u00f1o precursor and project this association to strengthen.\n",
