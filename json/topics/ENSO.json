It is shown that when the daily, high-pass filtered (2\u201310 days) meridional wind at 250 hPa is chosen as the variable of the MEOF analysis, typical features of baroclinic waves/storm tracks over the wintertime North Pacific can be well described by this method. It is found that the first two leading modes of the MEOF analysis, MEOF1 and MEOF2, assume quite different patterns. MEOF1 takes the form of a single wave train running in the east-west direction along 40\u00b0N, while MEOF2 is a double wave train pattern running in the east-west direction along 50\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N, respectively. The shift composites of various anomalous fields based on MEOF1 and MEOF2 assume typical baroclinic wave features.</p>\n                    <p class=\"a-plus-plus\">MEOF1 represents a primary storm track pulsing with an intrinsic time scale of two days. It shows significant \u201cmidwinter suppression\u201d and apparent interannual variability. It is stronger after the mid-1990s than before the mid-1990s. MEOF2 represents a double-branch storm track, also with an intrinsic time scale of approximately two days, running along 50\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N, respectively. It shows no apparent seasonal variation, but its interannual and decadal variation is quite clear. It oscillates with larger amplitude and longer periods after the mid-1990s than before the mid-1990s, and is heavily modulated by El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</p>\n                  ",

It is found that positive rainfall anomalies with statistical significance appear over southern China in El Ni\u00f1o winter but no reversed significant rainfall anomalies in La Ni\u00f1a winter. The asymmetry of the rainfall anomalies are related with the asymmetry in anomalous circulation over western North Pacific (WNP) in lower troposphere, with a strong anomalous anticyclone in El Ni\u00f1o winter but a weak anomalous cyclone in La Ni\u00f1a winter. It is revealed that the asymmetric responses in anomalous circulation to El Nino and La Ni\u00f1a are affected by the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO). In El Ni\u00f1o winter the interannual variation is dominant and the ISO is weak, and the strong interannual variation leads to a strong response of the anomalous anticyclone over WNP in winter half year. However, in La Ni\u00f1a winter the ISO is dominant and the interannual variation is weak, and the weak interannual variation results in a weak response of the anomalous cyclone over WNP.</p>\n                  ",

Understanding such connection change is instrumental for climate prediction, particularly the decadal prediction. Results in this study show that mega-ENSO has experienced a notable inter-decadal change in its linkage with the winter NAO during the past 56\u00a0years: mega-ENSO was significantly correlated with the NAO during 1957\u20131981 (or synchronous epoch), while such correlation has broken down since 1982 (or out-synchronous epoch). This marked change might be attributed to a sea surface temperature (SST) forcing change in the North Atlantic, based on the observational and numerical evidences in this study. The synchronous epoch is concurrent with the anomalous tropical North Atlantic (TNA) SST forcing, whereas the out-synchronous epoch is associated with the anomalous extra-tropical North Atlantic (XNA) SST forcing. Two possible reasons may explain how the synchronous behaviors between mega-ENSO and the NAO were tied to the TNA SST anomaly (SSTA). There is a positive feedback between the TNA SSTA and the NAO-like atmosphere anomalies, which helps to \u201cprolong\u201d the NAO impacts from the developing phase through mature phase of mega-ENSO. Additionally, the TNA SSTA itself may induce a NAO-like atmosphere anomaly. Since 1982, the TNA SSTA has been replaced by the XNA SSTA and the latter primarily favors a NAO-neutral state in the atmosphere, which ends the synchronous epoch.</p>\n                  ",

The study is focused on the analysis of global rainfall and 2-m temperature over land (T2m) for December\u2013January\u2013February (DJF) seasonal mean. For rainfall, the spatial distribution of the ENSO SST induced changes on the spread of PDF strongly resembles changes in the mean but have a smaller amplitude. Over the central-eastern equatorial Pacific, changes in the spread lead to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during El Ni\u00f1o years while to an increase in the SNR during La Ni\u00f1a years. Over extratropics, year to year changes in the spread are relatively small. For T2m, the changes in spread have little systematic dependence on the ENSO SSTs and the amplitudes of the changes in spread are much smaller than corresponding changes in the ensemble mean. The results demonstrate small systematic year to year variations in the PDF spread, for example over extratropics for rainfall and over most of global land areas for T2m, and indicate that it might be a good practice in seasonal predictions to assume that the spread of seasonal means from year to year is constant and the skill in seasonal forecast information resides primarily in the shift of the first moment of the seasonal mean of the PDF.</p>\n                  ",

Several studies have found a consistent and statistically significant impact of El Ni\u00f1o over the North Atlantic European Sector, which could lead to an improvement of the skill of current seasonal forecast systems over Europe. Nevertheless, this signal seems to be non-stationary in time and it could be modulated by the ocean at very low frequencies. Hence, the seasonal climate predictability based on El Ni\u00f1o could be variable and only effective for specific time periods. This study considers the multidecadal changes in the ocean mean state as a possible modulator of ENSO-European rainfall teleconnection at interannual timescales. A long control simulation of the CNRM-CM5 model is used to substantiate this hypothesis and to assess if it can be relevant to explain the non-stationary behavior seen in the twentieth century. The model reproduces the leading rainfall mode over the Euro-Mediterranean region, and its non stationary link with El Ni\u00f1o. This teleconnection has been identified in coincidence with changes of the zonal mean flow at upper levels, which influence the propagation of the waves from the tropics to extratropics through the atmosphere and, hence, to explain the changing impact over Europe. However, the non-stationary impact observed along the twentieth century could also be related to the observed changes in the interannual oceanic forcing signal itself. The results obtained suggest, for both hypotheses, an important role of the natural internal variability of the ocean at multidecadal timescales.</p>\n                  ",

The prediction of summer rainfall anomalies in East Asia is difficult, while the WTP has a strong correlation between model prediction and observation. We focus on developing a new approach to further enhance the seasonal prediction skill for summer rainfall in East Asia and investigate the influence of convective activity in the WTP on East Asian summer rainfall. By analyzing the characteristics of the WTP convection, two distinct patterns associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation developing and decaying modes are identified. Based on the multiple linear regression method, the East Asia Rainfall Index (EARI) is developed by using the interannual variability of the normalized Maritime continent-WTP Indices (MPIs), as potentially useful predictors for rainfall prediction over East Asia, obtained from the above two main patterns. For East Asian summer rainfall, the EARI has superior performance to the East Asia summer monsoon index or each MPI. Therefore, the regressed rainfall from EARI also shows a strong relationship with the observed East Asian summer rainfall pattern. In addition, we evaluate the prediction skill of the East Asia reconstructed rainfall obtained by hybrid dynamical\u2013statistical approach using the cross-validated EARI from the individual models and their MME. The results show that the rainfalls reconstructed from simulations capture the general features of observed precipitation in East Asia quite well. This study convincingly demonstrates that rainfall prediction skill is considerably improved by using a hybrid dynamical\u2013statistical approach compared to the dynamical forecast alone.</p>\n                  ",

Was the heavy Australian rainfall influenced by La Ni\u00f1a conditions and/or anthropogenic greenhouse gases? We investigate the relative contributions of anthropogenic climate change and natural climatic variability to the likelihood of heavy Australian rainfall using three distinct model datasets. Area-average rainfall anomalies for model simulations with natural forcings only were compared to simulations with both anthropogenic and natural forcings using 16 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Using fraction of attributable risk to compare the likelihood of unusual rainfall between the parallel experiments, we find attribution statements are uncertain, with FAR values sensitive to the attribution parameters considered, including thresholds, regions and seasons. When heavy rainfall probabilities were next investigated in ensembles of two atmospheric general circulation models, run with and without anthropogenically-induced sea surface temperature changes, results were model-dependent. Overall, the attribution of seasonal-scale heavy Australia rainfall to a particular cause is likely more complicated than for temperature extremes. As estimates of the greenhouse gas attributable change in rainfall risk may depend on the model datasets considered, it is also useful to consider model outputs from several datasets and using various estimates of counterfactual surface conditions to establish robust attribution statements for extreme rainfall events. In contrast, comparing the likelihoods of heavy rainfall during simulated La Ni\u00f1a years with El Ni\u00f1o/neutral years reveals a substantial La Ni\u00f1a influence on Australian rainfall during 2010\u20132012 that is robust to changes in the attribution framework.</p>\n                  ",

New results from the Northern Hemisphere are presented, complementing previous Southern Hemisphere (SH) results using an identical methodology. Expansion rates are largest over Asia and Australia-New Zealand (ANZ). Other regions show more modest rates of expansion, and there is no statistically significant expansion over North America. In the hemispheric average, expansion rates are slightly larger in the SH. This asymmetry, although not statistically significant, is consistent with ozone depletion acting as a codriver of tropical expansion since 1979. The picture of regional expansion here is different from that in other studies or that derived solely from reanalyses. The relationships between tropical expansion and modes of climate variability are explored using partial regression techniques. Interannually, a relationship is seen with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) across most of the globe. Regionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has a significant impact over Asia, while the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) affects expansion over ANZ. Considering the longer-term changes in the climate variability indices since 1979, it suggests that the PDO may account for up to 50% of the observed tropical expansion over Asia, while SAM may account for 20\u201330% of the SH expansion, particularly over ANZ. Decadal changes in ENSO may account for a further 20\u201330% of the global and regional trends. Accounting for the effect of climate variability helps to reconcile the differences in observations and model-based simulations of tropical expansion.\n",

This upwelling system provides a critical teleconnection between the Atlantic and tropical Pacific that may impact climate variability on a global scale. Despite its importance to oceanographic circulation, ecology, and climate, little is known about the stability of the Panamanian upwelling system or its interaction with climatic forcing on millennial timescales. Using a combination of radiocarbon and U-series dating of fossil corals collected in cores from five sites across Pacific Panam\u00e1, we reconstructed the local radiocarbon reservoir correction, \u0394R, from ~6750 cal BP to present. Because the \u0394R of shallow-water environments is elevated by upwelling, our dataset represents a millennial-scale record of spatial and temporal variability of the Panamanian upwelling system. The general oceanographic gradient from relatively strong upwelling in the Gulf of Panam\u00e1 to weak-to-absent upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriqu\u00ed was present throughout our record; however, the intensity of upwelling in the Gulf of Panam\u00e1 varied significantly through time. Our reconstructions suggest that upwelling in the Gulf of Panam\u00e1 is weak at present; however the middle Holocene was characterized by periods of enhanced upwelling, with the most intense upwelling occurring at the onset of a regional shutdown in reef development at ~4100 cal BP. Comparisons with regional climate proxies suggest that, whereas the Intertropical Convergence Zone is the primary control on modern upwelling in Pacific Panam\u00e1, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation drove the variability in upwelling on millennial timescales.\n",

A strong positive trend in nitrate flux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat flux. Increased upwelling and nitrate flux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual fluctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published findings suggests that local wind intensification persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes. Understanding the different time scales of variability in forcing mechanisms, and their interactions with each other, is necessary to distinguish transient ecosystem impacts from secular trends.\n",

Over the full season (June-September), Pacific SSTs correlate with rainfall in western India more than that in eastern India. This spatial signature shifts as the monsoon progresses through early (June), middle or peak (July-August) and late (September) sub-seasons. Specifically, a 1\u2218C cooling of the central equatorial Pacific (i.e. La Ni\u00f1a conditions) can result in: \u223c 70-100% increase in precipitation in north-central Indian and theIndo-Gangetic Plains during the early season, \u223c 30-80% increase peak season precipitation in south-central India north-western Rajasthan, and \u223c 30-80% increase in late season precipitation in northern, north-western, and central India. Furthermore, the spatial signatures between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o are asymmetric in that for a particular location, the enhancement and suppression of rainfall associated with La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions, respectively, are notequal. El Ni\u00f1o suppresses peak season rainfall in the south-central and northwestern Rajasthan regions more than La Ni\u00f1a enhances it, but, the opposite occurs during the late-season in northern, northwestern, and central India. Additionally, the correspondence of minima (maxima) in anomalies of velocity potential aloft with maxima (minima) at 925 mb and with positive (negative) surface pressure anomalies suggest that anomalous subsidence (ascent) occurs in July, August, and September during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) times. In the early season, however, patterns of velocity potential composites suggest a region of descent (ascent) over the western equatorial Indian Ocean, along with a region of ascent (descent) over the Indian subcontinent that exists only during the early season, but not during the peak or late season. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that local Hadley cell circulation affects pressure, and thus, rainfall during the early season, but that a larger scale mechanism, such as eastward or westward shifts in the Walker circulation, may be more responsible for teleconnections seen throughout the remainder of the season. These findings indicate that focusing monsoon forecasting efforts on these regions and on sub-seasonal periods while incorporating ENSO asymmetries will yield useful and skillful regional forecasts, compared to the declining utility and skill of All-India summer monsoon rainfall (AISMR).\n",

        "description": "\n\nWe present coral- and sclerosponge-based reconstructions of the 14C content in North Atlantic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during the last ~100\u2009years from the subtropical cells (STCs). These waters are sensitive to the dynamics of the shallow overturning meridional circulation that transports heat and water masses from the subtropics to the tropics. We use these records to investigate the circulation patterns of the off-equatorial upwelling regions of the STCs, which are not well understood. Coral and sclerosponge skeletons provide long time series of ocean DIC 14C content, a tracer of oceanic circulation, effectively extending the observational record back in time. Sclerosponge data from the Bahamas were used to extend the existing subtropical 14C time series to the 21st century. Coral 14C data from the Cape Verde Islands (1890\u20132002) captured the 14C signature of water brought to the surface in the off-equatorial regions of the STC present near the West African coast. We observe a unique postbomb trend at Cape Verde that is similar to the upwelling regions in the Pacific, and we interpret this trend as the result of the slow penetration of bomb 14C into the interior ocean as part of the STC circulation. Using a multibox mixing model we constrain the time history of bomb 14C in the eastern tropical Atlantic, and we estimate a 20\u2009year time scale for ventilation of the thermocline in this area of the ocean. The similarity between the Atlantic and Pacific 14C-based records of upwelling suggests that both are caused by bomb 14C penetration rather than more complex explanations that invoke changes in thermocline depth (e.g., related to El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation variability) or changes in the strength of the subtropical cells. Our results offer constraints for models of tropical ocean circulation and anthropogenic CO2 uptake that attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the shallow wind-driven circulation in the Atlantic.\n",

We show that El Ni\u00f1o-Southern\nOscillation (ENSO) related inter-annual change in tropospheric ozone in the\ntropics is small in relation to combined intra-seasonal/Madden\u2013Julian\nOscillation (MJO) and shorter timescale variability by a factor of ~ 3\u201310\n(largest in the Atlantic). Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), taken as a\nproxy for convection, suggests that convection is a dominant driver of\nlarge-scale variability of tropospheric ozone in the Pacific from\ninter-annual (e.g., ENSO) to weekly periods. We compare tropospheric ozone\nand OLR satellite observations with two simulations: (1) the Goddard Earth\nObserving System (GEOS) chemistry-climate model (CCM) that uses observed sea\nsurface temperatures and is otherwise free-running, and (2) the NASA Global\nModeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model (CTM) that is driven by\nModern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)\nanalyses. It is shown that the CTM-simulated ozone accurately matches\nmeasurements for timescales from ENSO to intra-seasonal/MJO and even\n1\u20132-week periods. The CCM simulation reproduces ENSO variability but not\nshorter timescales. These analyses suggest that a model used to delineate\ntemporal and/or spatial properties of tropospheric ozone and convection in the\ntropics must reproduce both ENSO and non-ENSO variability.",

Different behaviours of precipitation over AB are found to the north and south of 8\u00b0S when the longitudinal band 70\u00b0\u201350\u00b0W is considered. The sample is then split into northern and southern sectors with respect to 8\u00b0S, describing their monthly evolution as a function of longitude. The main spatial oscillation modes are isolated and analysed through continuous wavelet transform analysis. Intense spatial oscillations are found close to the western side of the studied region. Several temporal modes in different scales are detected within each sample. Two of them show scales longer than 12 months, which are probably associated with ENSO phases. Smaller scale oscillations, evaluated from daily data, are also found. The northern sector of AB shows more daily data variability than the southern one and seems to be more affected by large temporal processes than the southern sector.\n",

Recent decreases in precipitation over the region may be significant in the context of instrumental records, but the question of whether these decreases are within long-term natural variability remains. To help address this issue, we present December\u2013January streamflow and dam inflow reconstructions for southeastern Australia. These reconstructions for the Tasmanian west coast are based solely on local tree ring chronologies and span up to 1600 years. Nonparametric estimates, however, indicate good model skill for the last 458 years (streamflow) and 478 years (dam inflow). The reconstructions indicate that twentieth century conditions were well within the range of historical variability, and were in fact relatively wet. The period from approximately 1600 to 1750 CE was one of the enhanced variability and a high proportion of low and high flow events occurred in the seventeenth century. There are significant relationships between streamflow and inflow reconstructions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere processes such as ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode. Critically, our two reconstructions rely heavily on new tree ring chronologies based on properties such as tracheid radial diameter, cell wall thickness, and density, underscoring the importance of these different types of chronologies in reconstructions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Southeast Pacific, which encompasses the coasts of Peru and Chile, is one of the world's most productive regions resulting principally from the upwelling of subsurface nutrient-rich waters. Over the satellite altimetry era, there have been numerous evidence that surface mesoscale eddies play an important role in the offshore transport of rich coastal waters, but it has been only recently that few observational/numerical studies have highlighted the importance of the subsurface eddies. The eddy field variability is explored using the results of a high-resolution model experiment from 1979 to 2012. The model results indicate an asymmetry of the surface and subsurface eddy fields. While surface-intensified cyclones are slightly more frequent than anticyclones, the subsurface field is dominated by anticyclones (IntrathermoclineEddies; ITEs), triggered by the instability of the subsurface Peru Chile undercurrent (PCUC). Composite maps are consistent with in situ observations. ITEs are associated with maximum vorticity around 150\u2013200 m depth, warmer and more saline core, characteristic of the equatorial subsurface water from the PCUC. We find that the variability of the ITEs is significantly correlated with the ENSO equatorial signal. During strong El Ni\u00f1o events (e.g., 1982; 1998), we find that while the PCUC transport increases, the volume of coastal waters transported by ITEs however decreases during those periods. We find that the relaxation of the isopycnals along the coast during El Ni\u00f1o events leads to weakened baroclinic instability and to a decrease of the ITEs transport.\n",

These changes over land and ocean are spatially coherent and comprise of a rearrangement of very wet regions and a systematic expansion of dry zones. While the increased likelihood of extremes is consistent with a higher average temperature during the pause (as compared to 1979\u20131997), it is important to note that the periods considered are also characterized by a transition from a relatively warm to cold phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To further probe the relation between contrasting phases of ENSO and extremes in accumulation, a similar comparison is performed between 1960\u20131978 (another extended cold phase of ENSO) and the aforementioned warming era. Though limited by land-only observations, in this cold-to-warm transition, remarkably, a near-exact reversal of extremes is noted both statistically and geographically. This is despite the average temperature being higher in 1979\u20131997 as compared to 1960\u20131978. Taken together, we propose that there is a fundamental mode of natural variability, involving the waxing and waning of extremes in accumulation of global tropical rainfall with different phases of ENSO.\n",

        "description": "\n\nENSO (El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation) has profound effects on the global water cycle, which can be examined at the process level by investigating the associated water isotopologues. Many isotope-based studies are aimed at understanding ENSO variability in the tropics, however, focusing principally on near-surface processes and isotopologue signals. The goal of the present study is to investigate the atmospheric processes governing the changes in the isotopic composition of water vapor both near the surface and at midtroposphere in the Pacific region during ENSO events, using a combination of remote sensing data and model simulations. For the lower atmosphere (i.e., 1000\u2009hPa), our results show that rainout processes, less rain reevaporation of falling droplets, and increase of convective updrafts and diffusive exchange within the convective systems contribute to \u201cthe isotope amount effect\u201d and isotopically deplete the water vapor during wet conditions, in agreement with previous studies. However, we find that the ENSO-associated isotopic signal in the midtroposphere (i.e., 500\u2009hPa) diverges from the near-surface response. Analysis suggests that transport of enriched water vapor from lower atmospheric layers through convective updrafts controls the enrichment of midtropospheric water vapor over the Pacific Ocean. In the observations, a strong positive correlation between the increase of convective precipitation and the isotopic composition of water vapor clearly points to such a mechanism (R of 0.7\u20130.8 in the Central Pacific and 0.5\u20130.6 in the West Pacific). Model results confirm this mechanisms though producing slightly lower correlation values, with R values of 0.6 in the Central Pacific and 0.5 in the West Pacific. However, the distinction between convective and stratiform precipitation remains a result of model-dependent parameterization. Our analysis suggests that two issues should be investigated in more detail in further studies: (1) the equilibrium and disequilibrium between rain droplets and surrounding vapor for convective and stratiform precipitation and (2) different convection schemes in the different isotopic general circulation models (GCMs) describing the triggering of convection and uplift of lower layer air to higher layers. Ideally, such a comparison of different isotopic GCMs can provide us with an interesting benchmark test for the performance of the different convection schemes during ENSO and can help to disentangle the importance of the different processes contributing to the amount effect.\n",

The variability in surface chlorophyll is complex. Whereas the spring bloom generates the highest phytoplankton concentration for coastal Alaska, the north and east coasts of Haida Gwaii, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and coastal Oregon and California, it is the fall bloom that normally generates the highest concentration for the west coast of Vancouver Island, Juan de Fuca Strait, and the west coast of Washington. The highest satellite-sensed chlorophyll concentrations occur in the Strait of Georgia, where mean values are at least 2 times higher than elsewhere in the northeast Pacific. Moreover, the annual average surface chlorophyll concentration increased significantly in the Strait of Georgia during this period, with highest concentration observed during the near neutral ENSO conditions of the spring of 2007. The next highest concentrations occur off southwest Vancouver Island but have no statistically significant trend. The lowest average peak chlorophyll concentration is observed off Southern California. The timing of the highest chlorophyll concentration is latest off the coast of Washington and earliest off the coast of Southern California. Small increasing concentration trends are observed off the Washington and California coasts.\n",

The review includes a history of droughts and floods in the past, in the present and some discussions on future extremes in the context of climate change and its impacts on the Amazon region. Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as \u2018once in a century\u2019, have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river's main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012\u20132015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Ni\u00f1a/El Ni\u00f1o events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.\n",

We address this issue by analyzing 28 years (1987\u20132014) of summer\naveraged dust concentrations at the high-altitude Iza\u00f1a observatory\n(~ 2400 m a.s.l.) on Tenerife, and satellite and meteorological\nreanalysis data. The summer meteorological scenario in North Africa (aloft\n850 hPa) is characterized by a high over the the subtropical Sahara and a\nlow over the tropics linked to the monsoon. We measured the variability of\nthis high\u2013low dipole-like pattern in terms of the North African dipole\nintensity (NAFDI): the difference of geopotential height anomalies averaged\nover the subtropics (30\u201332\u00b0 N, Morocco) and the tropics\n(10\u201313\u00b0 N, Bamako region) close to the Atlantic coast (at\n5\u20138\u00b0 W). We focused on the 700 hPa standard level due to\ndust export off the coast of North Africa tending to occur between 1 and\n5 km a.s.l. Variability in the NAFDI is associated with displacements of\nthe North African anticyclone over the Sahara and this has implications for\nwind and dust export. The correlations we found between the 1987\u20132014 summer\nmean of NAFDI with dust at Iza\u00f1a, satellite dust observations and\nmeteorological re-analysis data indicate that increases in the NAFDI (i)\nresult in higher wind speeds at the north of the Inter-Tropical Convergence\nZone that are associated with enhanced dust export over the subtropical North\nAtlantic, (ii) influence the long-term variability of the size distribution\nof exported dust particles (increasing the load of coarse dust) and (iii) are\nassociated with enhanced rains in the tropical and northern shifts of the\ntropical rain band that may affect the southern Sahel. Interannual\nvariability in NAFDI is also connected to spatial distribution of dust over\nthe North Atlantic; high NAFDI summers are associated with major dust export\n(linked to winds) in the subtropics and minor dust loads in the tropics\n(linked to higher rainfall), and vice versa. The evolution of the summer\nNAFDI values since 1950 to the present day shows connections to climatic\nvariability (through the Sahelian drought, ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern\nOscillation) and winds) that have implications for dust export paths. Efforts\nto anticipate how dust export may evolve in future decades will require a\nbetter understanding of how the large-scale meteorological systems\nrepresented by the NAFD will evolve.",

        "description": "\n\nThe spring predictability barrier increases the uncertainty in ENSO forecasts starting before and during the boreal spring. Recent work has shown that the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is responsible for phase locking of peak ENSO development to the boreal winter, suggesting that this annual cycle may play a role in the spring predictability barrier. To test this hypothesis, the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is added to a damped, noise-driven conceptual recharge oscillator model. When the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is included, a spring predictability barrier develops, whereas without it ENSO predictability is independent of the forecast start date. When state-dependent noise is included in the simulations in addition to the annual cycle of the growth rate, the spring predictability barrier is enhanced and more realistic.",

Using observed precipitation, the NINO3.4 index, and soil moisture and evapotranspiration simulated by a land surface model for 61\u2009years, analysis was performed using partial correlations to evaluate to what extent land surface and SST anomaly of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can affect seasonal precipitation over different regions and seasons. Results show that antecedent soil moisture is as important as concurrent ENSO condition in controlling rainfall anomalies over the U.S., but they generally dominate in different seasons with SST providing more predictability during winter while soil moisture, through its linkages to evapotranspiration and snow water, has larger influence in spring and early summer. The proposed methodology is applicable to climate model outputs to evaluate the intensity of land-atmosphere coupling and its relative importance.",

Detailed analyses have indicated that this strength asymmetry is mainly derived from the weaker sensitivity of the zonal sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly to that of the diabatic heating anomaly during the development phase of CP El Ni\u00f1o events, which mainly results from the large cancelation induced by the negative sea surface temperature (SST)-cloud thermodynamic feedback that negates the positive dynamical feedback. This study validates these conclusions by using historical runs of 20 models involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Our results suggest that the CMIP5 models generally depict the asymmetry in amplitude between the two types of El Ni\u00f1o events well, which is consistent with successfully simulating the strength asymmetry of the Bjerknes feedback. As observed during both types of El Ni\u00f1o events, variations in the total cloud amount and shortwave radiation also indicated that the cloud-radiative effect is an important factor that causes amplitude asymmetry between CP and EP El Ni\u00f1o events. However, the CMIP5 models are severely biased when capturing realistic CP El Ni\u00f1o structures, namely few models can simulate the significantly weaker warming anomalies in the EP relative to the CP.\n",

Analyses focus on the period beginning with regular satellite monitoring of TCs (1969/1970) through the year 2012/2013 and consider daily and multi-daily annual maximum rainfall series. Our results indicate that TCs play a prominent role in extreme rainfall over much Australia, with more than half of the highest annual rainfall events associated with these storms over the coastal regions and in particular over Western Australia. Moreover, the TC fractional contribution to extreme rainfall increases as we focus on the largest rainfall events, with approximately 66\u2013100% of annual maxima in excess of 100\u2009mm (\u223c4\u2009inches) over Western Australia associated with TCs at over one third of the locations. Given the well-established controls on Australian TC activity by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we also examined the relationship between extreme rainfall associated with TCs and ENSO using logistic regression. A larger probability of having an annual rainfall maximum related to TCs occurs during La Ni\u00f1a years, consistent with enhanced Australian cyclogenesis during these phases of ENSO. We also highlighted regional differences in the link between ENSO and extreme rainfall events, highlighting the stronger connection along the coastal areas and in particular over Western Australia.\n",

Results suggest that the ISV characteristics show some differences in the two types of El Ni\u00f1o, although both oscillate along the thermocline in the form of the intraseasonal equatorial Kelvin wave (IEKW), which is excited in the western tropical Pacific by the zonal wind stress associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO). First, the period of dominant mode of the STA ISV during CP El Ni\u00f1o broadly distributes in 50\u201380 days with the spectra peaking in 60\u201365 days. By contrast, the spectrum of STA ISV during EP El Ni\u00f1o shows a peak in 75\u201380-day period. This indicates that the wave speed is faster in the CP El Ni\u00f1o than in EP El Ni\u00f1o. Second, the ISV activity peaks in previous spring during the developing phase of EP El Ni\u00f1o, whereas during CP El Ni\u00f1o it becomes the most active during the mature phase. Third, the strongest IEKW occurs in the CP around the dateline during CP El Ni\u00f1o and attenuates quickly east of 130\u00b0W due to strong eddy viscosity dissipation, while the IEKW during the EP El Ni\u00f1o propagates efficiently from the western to the eastern Pacific with a relative weak diffusion.\n",

The ASWI is significantly correlated with the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel in the 1900\u20132013 period (r\u2009=\u2009+0.57, r\u2009=\u2009+0.66 and r\u2009=\u2009+0.53 for July, August and September respectively). By using historical wind direction measurements it has been possible to compute the ASWI back to 1790 for July and to 1839 for August and September, thus providing the first instrumental record of the West African Monsoon strength for a large portion of the 19th century.\nSince the 1970s, the Sahel has experienced a strong and persistent drought. During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel. Notwithstanding, two of the few dry years within this period were concurrent with large volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere. This latter result supports the recently described relationship between major volcanic eruptions and the occurrence of isolated drought episodes in the Sahel.\n",

The time series of the ENSO-like pattern significantly correlates with the EAWM index for the period 1949\u20132004 based on the HadISST SST data set and the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. Their correlation coefficient is \u22120.32 at the 95% confidence level.

The spatial correlation coefficients between the three-model ensemble and observation in the atmospheric circulation and surface air temperature range from 0.15 to 0.80 at the 99% confidence level.

Analysis of in situ data over a grid of hydrographic stations and oblique zooplankton hauls with bongo net (505 \u00b5m) was combined with orthogonal robust functions decomposition applied to altimetry anomalies obtained from satellite. During both cool (March and June) and warm (August and November) periods, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity Index defined three recurrent larval fish habitats which varied in species composition and extent as a function of the environmental scales. The variability of the Tropical larval fish habitat (characterized by high species richness, and dominated by Vinciguerria lucetia, Diogenichthys laternatus, and Diaphus pacificus) was associated with the seasonal changes. The Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat (dominated by V. lucetia and D. laternatus, with lower mean abundance and lower species richness than in the Tropical habitat) and Coastal-and-Upwelling larval fish habitat (dominated by Bregmaceros bathymaster) was associated mainly with mesoscale activity induced by eddies and with coastal upwelling. During February 2010, the Tropical larval fish habitat predominated offshore and the Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat was not present, which we attribute to the effect of El Ni\u00f1o conditions. Thus, the mesoscale, seasonal, and interannual environmental scales affect the composition and extension of larval fish habitats.\n",

Such sea level variability should be taken into consideration when planning efforts to mitigate the effects of future sea level change. In this study, we quantify the contribution to regional sea level of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Through cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis (CSEOF) of the long reconstructed sea level data set and of a set of U.S. tide gauges, two global modes dominated by Pacific Ocean variability are identified and related to ENSO and, by extension, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. By estimating the combined contribution of these two modes to regional sea level, we find that ENSO can contribute significantly on short time scales, with contributions of up to 20 cm along the west coast of the U.S. The CSEOF decomposition of the long tide gauge records around the U.S. highlights the influence of ENSO on the U.S. east coast. Tandem analyses of both the reconstructed and tide gauge records also examine the utility of the sea level reconstructions for near-coast studies.\n",

This study investigates how Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models represent different types of ENSO and how they represent teleconnections to South American precipitation. It is found that the CMIP5 models can represent the basic structure of SST anomalies that occur during different types of ENSO events and these are described using simple SST indices. Most of the CMIP5 models can reproduce the correct sign of precipitation anomalies in northeast South America during austral summer and autumn, in cases where the observed teleconnections are relatively strong. The same is also true of north South America in austral summer. In the east and southeast regions of South America, many models fail to reproduce the correct sign during both Canonical and Modoki/Central Pacific/Warm Pool ENSO events. The precipitation composites in Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) models tend to agree with their CMIP5 counterparts, so we conclude that the errors in teleconnections are not principally driven by mean SST biases. Precipitation teleconnections in the northern regions are shown to be linked to variations in the Walker circulation in models, with the exception of that in north South America during March\u2013May. During March\u2013May, composite precipitation in southeast South America is related to wave trains emanating from the equator.\n",

Early and late monsoon onsets are related to the temperature anomalies in different regions. It is found that an early onset follows negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central tropical Pacific (CP) Ocean during the preceding winter and spring, corresponding to a CP La Ni\u00f1a. In contrast, a late onset is preceded by the negative surface air temperature anomalies over land in the central Asian continent. Negative SST anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the associated warming in the western Pacific induce an anomalously enhanced Walker circulation. This anomalous Walker cell leads to an increase in convection, causing more latent heat release and a subsequent decrease of surface pressure. The anomalous Walker cell and the enhanced latent heat release weaken the Western North Pacific subtropical high and the Philippine Sea anticyclone, favouring a westerly flow from the Indian Ocean, resulting in an early SCSSM onset. On the other hand, negative land surface temperature anomalies cool the atmosphere over land, and locally modify the Hadley circulation, accompanied by the anomalous divergence in the low-level atmosphere over the western equatorial Pacific. This divergence anomaly reduces the latent heat release and strengthens the anticyclone in the Philippine Sea, thus preventing the westward extension of the westerlies from the Indian Ocean and causing a late SCSSM onset.\n",

The SST conditions and performance of the south Asian monsoon during 2013 boreal summer months (June\u2013September) led us to hypothesize that the strong extratropical SST anomalies in the North Pacific and North Atlantic in conjunction with weak tropical SST anomalies (weak La Ni\u00f1a) were responsible for the above-normal rainfall over India during 2013. We also argue that the 2013 SST pattern and above-normal monsoon condition are not unique but occurred on several occasions in the past. Further, we show that there is a complementary pattern of strong extratropical SST and weak tropical SST that is associated with below-normal south Asian monsoon rainfall. We also show that the extratropical SST pattern in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with a low-frequency interdecadal mode of variability indicating potential predictability associated with such extratropical SST forcing. Extensive experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced by such SST conditions elucidate the mechanism through which the extratropical SSTs influence the Indian monsoon. The SST anomalies affect the north\u2013south temperature gradient and lead to a local displacement of the jet stream, setting up a quasi-stationary wave. Such a stationary wave, in turn, affects the tropospheric temperature (TT) over southern Eurasia, influencing the north\u2013south TT gradient in the region and thereby the Indian monsoon. Our discovery of this additional source of potential predictability together with the fact that the new-generation coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models are capable of predicting the extratropical SST anomalies brightens the prospect of south Asian monsoon prediction.\n",

Lacking strong convection, they do not become electrified by the usual thunderstorm mechanisms of collisional electrification between hydrometeors of different phases. Instead, the background global circuit current flow in fair weather is largely unaffected by the layer cloud's presence, and, if the layer cloud is extensive horizontally, the vertical fair weather conduction current passes through the cloud. A consequence of the vertical current flow is that, at the cloud\u2013air boundary where there is a conductivity transition and droplets form or evaporate, droplet charging occurs. Charge can affect both droplet evaporation and droplet\u2013droplet collisions. Using new radiosonde instrumentation, the charge observed at layer cloud edges is evaluated for both these microphysical droplet processes. This shows that the charging is more likely to affect collision processes than activation, for small droplets. Enhancing the collection efficiency of small droplets modifies their evolution and propagates through the size distribution to shorten the autoconversion time-scale to rain drops, and the cloud radiative properties. Because the conduction current density is influenced by both external (e.g. solar modulation of high-energy particles) and internal (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation) factors, current flow leading to layer cloud edge charging provides a possible route for expressing solar influences on the climate system and a teleconnection mechanism for communicating internal climate variability.\n",

Roberts, C. Plummer, T. Vance, T. van Ommen, A. Moy, S. Poynter, A. Treverrow, M. Curran, and S. George<br /><br />Accurate high-resolution records of snow accumulation rates in Antarctica are\ncrucial for estimating ice sheet mass balance and subsequent sea level\nchange. Snowfall rates at Law Dome, East Antarctica, have been linked with\nregional atmospheric circulation to the mid-latitudes as well as regional\nAntarctic snowfall. Here, we extend the length of the Law Dome accumulation record from 750\nyears to 2035 years, using recent annual layer dating that extends to 22 BCE. Accumulation rates were calculated as the ratio of measured to modelled\nlayer thicknesses, multiplied by the long-term mean accumulation rate. The\nmodelled layer thicknesses were based on a power-law vertical strain rate\nprofile fitted to observed annual layer thickness. The periods 380\u2013442,\n727\u2013783  and 1970\u20132009 CE have above-average snow accumulation rates,\nwhile 663\u2013704, 933\u2013975 and 1429\u20131468 CE were below average, and\ndecadal-scale snow accumulation anomalies were found to be relatively common\n(74 events in the 2035-year record). The calculated snow accumulation rates\nshow good correlation with atmospheric reanalysis estimates, and significant\nspatial correlation over a wide expanse of East Antarctica, demonstrating\nthat the Law Dome record captures larger-scale variability across a large\nregion of East Antarctica well beyond the immediate vicinity of the Law Dome\nsummit. Spectral analysis reveals periodicities in the snow accumulation\nrecord which may be related to El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Interdecadal Pacific\nOscillation (IPO) frequencies.",

Horizontal spectral resolution is T159 (about 125 km), using 91 levels in the vertical from the surface up to 1 Pa, and a time step of 1 h. This ensemble, denoted by ERA-20CM, formed the first step toward a twentieth-century reanalysis within ERA-CLIM, a three-year European funded project involving nine partners.\nSea-surface temperature and sea-ice cover are prescribed by an ensemble of realizations (HadISST2), as recently produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre within ERA-CLIM. Variation in these realizations reflect uncertainties in the available observational sources on which this product is based. Forcing terms in the model radiation scheme follow CMIP5 recommendations. Any effect of their uncertainty is neglected. These terms include solar forcing, greenhouse gases, ozone and aerosols. Both the ocean surface and radiative forcing incorporate a proper long-term evolution of climate trends in the twentieth century, and the occurrence of major events, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillations and volcanic eruptions.\nNo atmospheric observations were assimilated. For this reason ERA-20CM is not able to reproduce actual synoptic situations. However, the ensemble is able to provide a statistical estimate of the climate. Overall, the temperature rise over land is in fair agreement with the CRUTEM4 observational product. Over the last two decades the warming over land exceeds the warming over sea, which is consistent with models participating in the CMIP5 project, as well as with the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Some aspects of warming and of the hydrological cycle are discerned, and the model response to volcanic eruptions is qualitatively correct.\nThe data from ERA-20CM are freely available, embracing monthly-mean fields for many atmospheric and ocean-wave quantities, and synoptic fields for a small, essential subset.\n",

After this decadal change, the interannual variability of the WNPSH is more strongly regulated by the SSTA over the equatorial central Pacific and the maritime continent. The earlier decay of El Ni\u00f1o in strong WNPSH years and the earlier development of El Ni\u00f1o in weak WNPSH years both contributed to this change. Such decadal change is found in the pre-industrial control simulation of a coupled model, suggesting it is probably an internal variability of the climate system.\n",

In combination with NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis 850-hPa wind field and 160 stations' precipitation data in China, an intimate connection between the tropical Pacific SsT and eastern China summer precipitation anomalies is discovered by examining the time-lagged and simultaneous correlations among the interannual anomalies of SsT in the tropical Pacific, the 850-hPa wind pattern and summer rainfall in China. In previous winter, if the SsT in the tropical Pacific indicates an El Ni\u00f1o-type anomaly, an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the East Asian coast, South China Sea and east of Taiwan along with a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the Japanese archipelago emerges in following summer. At the same time, a cyclonic circulation and an anticyclonic circulation prevail over the Lake Baikal and Kuril Islands in the high latitude. These combined circulation patterns facilitate the southward transport of cold air from high latitude and northward transport of warm and moist air through the western edge of the subtropical high. The meet between two air masses results in significantly abundant anomalous precipitation in the Sichuan Basin, Dongting and Poyang Lake Basin, and possibly deficit precipitation occurs over the Hetao region and lower Yellow River Basin, northern Zhejiang, as well as the coastal region of southern China and southern Yunnan. These findings offer a very useful predictive power for eastern China summer precipitation based on tropical Pacific SsT status in previous winter and subsequent developments of SsT and East Asian large-scale circulations.\n",

Preseason climatic/oceanic signals of the El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Sahel rainfall (20\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N, 20\u00b0W\u201310\u00b0E) and the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) across a selected domain, all of which are closely associated with the dominant principal components of the North Atlantic Hurricane Track Density Function (HTDF), are applied as predictors.\nWhile using the Poisson regression without dividing the season into differing levels of activity types greatly degrades the model, classification of season types [based on accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)] before using the Poisson regression, can significantly improve the model performance. With this proposed new methodology, landfall counts in hyperactive and above-normal season type years can be predicted with 56.01 and 71.36% skill improvements respectively, compared with merely using climatology.\n",

A significant negative correlation coefficient (CC) centre is located in the western Pacific, while a positive CC centre is located in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Case analyses also confirm that an El Nino (La Nina) event is more likely to bring more (less) hazy days during winter. The key circulation pattern for less haze includes stronger Siberian high and Aleutian low pressure systems, stronger northerly wind over eastern Asia, and also a stronger high-level subtropical westerly jet (i.e. stronger East Asian winter monsoon, EAWM). While more haze often occurs under weaker EAWM pattern. The influencing mechanism of the ENSO event could be explained first, by how it alters the pressure and thermal differences between the Asian continent and the western Pacific Ocean, second, by the change of the circulation pattern of EAWM, and finally by the effect of the northerlies at higher latitudes. Compared to the relationship between ENSO and EAWM, the ENSO\u2013haze relationship is more stable. Results also indicate an ENSO event has a leading influence on the haze frequency and can be used as a predictor in the seasonal forecasts of hazy days.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIn order to gain a full understanding of the importance of interactions between the atmosphere and inland water bodies, there is a need to analyse these exchanges in different regions throughout the world and under a wide range of weather and climate conditions. A 2-year time series of energy balance measurements was made at a small reservoir situated in southeast Queensland, Australia. Measurements were used to establish diurnal, intra-seasonal and seasonal cycles of evaporation, while synoptic weather maps and local weather station data were used to relate variations in water surface\u2013atmosphere energy exchanges to synoptic and mesoscale weather phenomena. Consistent diurnal peaks in latent heat flux during the afternoon were observed throughout this study as a result of strong dry winds coinciding with peak water surface temperatures. Occasional intra-seasonal pulses in latent heat flux (i.e. evaporation) in winter and spring were associated with the passage of cold fronts over southern Queensland, which brought strong dry westerly winds. The average annual evaporative water loss from the reservoir during the 2-year measurement campaign was 991\u2009mm year\u22121. It is thought that differences between the annual evaporation totals for the 2 years of this study may have been related to differences in the frequency of overcast conditions as a result of a change in the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.\n",

The spatial pattern and intensity of the PMM were found to be reasonably simulated by CMIP5 models, as was the subtropical atmosphere\u2013ocean coupling associated with the PMM. However, the persistence of the coupling, which sustains the PMM's duration and extends its pattern equatorward, was found to be underestimated in most of the CMIP5 models. Many of the simulated PMMs do not have a pattern that extends far enough into the tropical Pacific to influence El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The CMIP5 models that do produce longer persistence for the PMM coupling show a higher correlation of the PMM with the Central-Pacific (CP) type of ENSO than with the Eastern-Pacific (EP) type of the ENSO. This study concludes that (1) the PMM and its associated subtropical Pacific ocean\u2013atmosphere coupling are important to the generation of the CP type of ENSO; (2) the so-called seasonal footprinting mechanism that sustains an equatorward extension of the PMM is not well simulated in a majority of the CMIP5 models; and (3) the persistence of the subtropical Pacific coupling is more important than the other properties in gauging a model's skill in the PMM simulation.\n",
