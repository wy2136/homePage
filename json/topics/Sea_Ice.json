We show that there are two possible mechanisms responsible for this interannual remote linkage. One is an Arctic mechanism. Extensive Arctic sea ice in the summer after a negative NAO acts as a bridge to the positive phase of the WP in the next winter. The other mechanism involves the tropics. An El Ni\u00f1o occurrence after a negative winter NAO acts as another bridge to the positive phase of the WP in the following winter. The timescale of the Arctic route is nearly decadal, whereas that of the tropical route is about 3\u20135\u00a0years. The tropical mechanism indicates that the NAO remotely excites an El Ni\u00f1o in the second half of the following year. A process perhaps responsible for the El Ni\u00f1o occurrence was investigated statistically. A negative NAO in the winter increases Eurasian snow cover. This anomalous snow cover then intensifies the cold air outbreak from Asia to the western tropical Pacific. This outbreak can intensify the westerly wind burst and excite El Ni\u00f1o in the following year. We suggest that the phase of the NAO in the winter could be a predictor of the WP in the following year.\n      </p>\n                  ",

This climate anomaly is part of a recent trend towards negative values of the NAO index that has occurred over recent winters. The negative trend of the NAO may be related to atmospheric internal variability but\u00a0it may also be partly forced by slowly varying components of the climate system. In the present study, we investigate the influence of surface conditions on the atmospheric circulation for the 2012\u20132013 winter using an atmospheric global climate model. In particular, the role of low Arctic sea ice concentration, warm tropical/North Atlantic sea surface temperature and positive Siberian snow cover anomalies are isolated by prescribing them in a set of different numerical experiments. Our simulations suggest that each of these surface forcings favored a negative NAO during the 2012\u20132013 winter. In our model, the combined NAO response to tropical/North Atlantic SST, Arctic sea ice and Siberian snow anomalies accounts for about 30\u00a0% of the observed NAO anomaly. Different physical mechanisms are explored to elucidate the atmospheric responses and are shown to involve both tropical and extratropical processes.</p>\n                  ",

HadGEM2-ES comprises atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice components which are interactively coupled to representations of the carbon cycle, aerosols including mineral dust and tropospheric chemistry. In this study, we focus on the atmosphere-only model HadGEM2-A coupled to terrestrial carbon cycle and aerosol models. This configuration is forced with monthly sea surface temperature and sea-ice fields from equivalent coupled simulations with an older version of the Hadley Centre model, HadCM3. HadGEM2-A simulates extreme cooling over northern continents and nearly complete die back of vegetation in Asia, giving a poor representation of the LGM environment compared with reconstructions of surface temperatures and biome distributions. The model also performs significantly worse for the LGM in comparison with its precursor AR4 model HadCM3M2. Detailed analysis shows that the major factor behind the vegetation die off in HadGEM2-A is a subtle change to the temperature dependence of leaf mortality within the phenology model of HadGEM2. This impacts on both snow-vegetation albedo and vegetation dynamics. A new set of parameters is tested for both the pre-industrial and LGM, showing much improved coverage of vegetation in both time periods, including an improved representation of the needle-leaf forest coverage in Siberia for the pre-industrial. The new parameters and the resulting changes in global vegetation distribution strongly impact the simulated loading of mineral dust, an important aerosol for the LGM. The climate response in an abrupt 4\u00d7 pre-industrial CO<sub class=\"a-plus-plus\">2</sub> simulation is also analysed and shows modest regional impacts on surface temperatures across the Boreal zone.</p>\n                  ",

Zonal averages for all variables were computed in 5-degree latitude bands. Unlike other regions of the Arctic Ocean, the marginal ice zone in the Greenland Sea is confined to north of 75\u00b0 N. The CHL time series is characterized by high interannual variability, especially in the northern marginal sea ice zone (MIZ) where variability in sea ice extent is a likely factor. The ten-year climatology shows that CHL increases from March, reaching a seasonal peak in May in the southern sector and in June in the northern sectors. The climatological peak of AOD is achieved in April in all latitude bands, about a month before the peak in CHL. This suggests that the Arctic aerosol burden is strongly affected by continental sources in early spring.</simple-para> <simple-para id=\"spar0015\" view=\"all\">Interestingly, a summer increase in AOD (which succeeds the CHL maximum) is seen in some years. Sea ice extent in early spring is less than 40% in the northern sector in all years. There is considerable interannual variability in both the onset of melt and the extent of sea ice loss during summer, with the minimum summer sea ice extent decreasing to almost zero in five of the years. Cross-correlation analyses of the three times series identify a statistically significant relation between CHL and AOD in six of the years in the southern sector, but no correlation between CHL and ICE was found in the northern sector. There is, however, a significant correlation between AOD and ICE time series in the northern sector in four years. High AOD values registered in early spring are most likely of anthropogenic origin, however, peaks later in summer coincident with the phytoplankton bloom and high emissions of biogenic aerosol precursors such as dimethylsulfide and other primary aerosols of marine origin, suggest the summer atmospheric aerosol burden is likely influenced by biogenic emissions.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Since the area surrounding Antarctica is largely unpolluted, LER changes can only be due to variations in the cloud cover and/or in the sea ice extension. In order to evaluate their influence on LER and assess the trend of the UV reflectivity under ice-free and various sea ice concentration (SIC) levels, we compared a multi-satellite-based LER dataset with different satellite observations of cloud cover and SIC for October to March from 1979 to 2012. Despite the high cloud fraction for most of this period, sea ice was found to be the main driver of LER variability and had a greater influence on LER variability than cloud cover. The cloud cover was lower in spring than in summer for all datasets, and this difference appears to be primarily associated with the sea ice extent. While an increment of the cloud fraction of 20% has been found to cause an increase in LER of up to 13 reflectivity units (RU) under ice-free conditions, this increase is halved under low SIC. In contrast, no significant changes in LER data were found under high SIC levels. The correlation between LER and SIC is evident when the latter is higher than approximately 30%. The best correlations (r) between LER and SIC were found for the Weddell Sea (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.87), the Ross Sea (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.85), and the Indian Ocean (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.90) for November, and for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.86) and the Pacific Ocean (r<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>=<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>0.83) for February and October, respectively. In contrast, no correlation was found in the proximity of the coastlines of west Antarctica in October. Overall, an enhancement of SIC from 0% to 100% results in a LER increase of 44<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU. This value is larger than the corresponding sea ice-induced increase computed for the observed and modeled shortwave albedos at the top of the atmosphere (21 and 13<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU, respectively). The LER data distributions for different regions and months show a marked seasonal double peak in reflectivity. The highest relative frequency is driven by the sea ice and peaks at approximately 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU, whereas the secondary peak of approximately 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>RU is dominated by cloudiness. Negative trends in the UV reflectivity of the grid cells characterized by a SIC greater than 30% were found for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (up to \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>3.6<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>\u00b1<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>1.0 per decade in March). Trends computed over the entire Southern Ocean for mid/high SIC bins are mostly negative, although are often not statistically significant. However, the trend in the reflectivity of the ice-free grid cells was generally positive, probably due to changes in the cloud amount/opacity.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In the model, the polynya area, defined as the frazil ice production region, is determined by a balance between the offshore consolidated ice drift and frazil ice production. We used daily polynya area, ice production and ice drift data derived from AMSR-E. The study area is the Ross Ice Shelf Polynya (RISP), which has the highest sea-ice production in the Southern Ocean. As a modification of the original model to apply the available satellite data set, we introduced the lag time by which produced frazil ice is transported and accumulated at the polynya edge. The model represents a half (48%\u201360%) of the polynya variability when using a lag time of 1.5 days. The frazil ice collection depth at the polynya edge, a key parameter in the model, is estimated to be \u223c16 cm. The expansion of the RISP is achieved by ice divergence, and the contraction is achieved mostly by ice production. Both the wind and the remaining components (mainly regarded as the ocean current component) in the ice divergence are larger in the western part of the RISP, which explains the larger extent there. In the one-dimensional frame, assuming that the frazil ice produced within the RISP transforms into consolidated ice with a thickness of 16 cm, the frazil ice production (\u223c1.7 \u00d7 103 m2day\u22121) within the RISP approximately balances the export (\u223c1.6 \u00d7 103 m2day\u22121) of consolidated thin ice from the RISP edge.

        "description": "\n\nOne of the challenges in evaluating and applying regional climate models (RCMs) is the non-linear behavior of atmospheric processes, which is still poorly understood. The non-linearities induce chaos which leads to an internal variability in the model. Therefore, an ensemble of RCM simulations has been run and a budget study for potential temperature has been applied to investigate the internally generated variability. Hence, the physical processes associated with diabatic and dynamical terms inducing the inter-member variability have been analyzed. The study is applied over the Arctic on an ensemble of 20 members, differing in their initial conditions, simulated with the RCM HIRHAM5 during summer 2012. This time period is of particular importance because of the melting sea ice and its influence on atmospheric circulation and the resulting effect on the inter-member variability. The amplitude of the inter-member variability of the simulations fluctuates strongly both temporally and spatially. During the beginning of August 2012 the inter-member variability is strongest and coincides with the great Arctic cyclone event. The most important contributions for the inter-member variability tendency are the horizontal and vertical \u2018baroclinic\u2019 terms. Both terms have largest absolute values along the coastlines of the Arctic Ocean which are associated with the Arctic frontal zone leading to the cyclone maximum over the Arctic Ocean during summer.\n",

We assess atmospheric and oceanic drivers responsible for this extreme event. In terms of atmospheric drivers, mild Bothnian Bay winters are characterized by positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) associated with the advection of air from the North Atlantic. In winter 2014/15, NAO was at a record high level and resulted in a northerly storm track associated with vigorous southwesterlies that drove ice towards the northeastern end of the bay. Furthermore, we found that the 1985-2015 Baltic Sea ice extent distribution differs from any other preceding thirty-winter period since 1720 with a high confidence. Based on climate projections, it is very likely that in the next fifty years partially ice-free Bothnian Bay will go from being an extremely rare event to a new normal.\n",

Mixed-phase processes are often poorly represented in global models and many use an empirically-based diagnostic partition between the liquid and ice phase that is dependent solely on temperature. However, increasingly more complex microphysical parameterizations are being implemented allowing a more physical representation of mixed-phase clouds.\nThis study uses in situ observations from the ASCOS field campaign in the central Arctic to assess the impact of a change from a diagnostic to a prognostic parameterization of mixed-phase clouds and increased vertical resolution in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The newer cloud scheme improves the representation of the vertical structure of mixed-phase clouds, with super-cooled liquid water at cloud top and ice precipitating below, improved further with higher vertical resolution. Increased super-cooled liquid water and decreased ice content are both in closer agreement with observations. However, these changes do not result in any substantial improvement in surface radiation, and a warm and moist bias in the lowest part of the atmosphere remains. Both schemes also fail to capture the transitions from overcast to cloud-free conditions. Moreover, whereas the observed cloud layer is frequently decoupled from the surface, the modelled clouds remain coupled to the surface most of the time. The changes implemented to the cloud scheme are an important step forward in improving the representation of Arctic clouds, but improvements in other aspects such as boundary layer turbulence, cloud radiative properties, sensitivity to low aerosol concentrations and representation of the sea-ice surface may also need to be addressed.\n",

In the North Atlantic, the distribution of sea level change is more due to the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing, whereas it is more due to the \u201cwind\u201d forcing in the North Pacific; in the Southern Ocean, the \u201cthermal\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d forcing have a comparable influence. In the ocean adjacent to Antarctica the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing leads to an inflow of warmer waters on the continental shelves, which is somewhat attenuated by the \u201cwind\u201d forcing. The structure of the vertically integrated heat uptake is set by different processes at low and high latitudes: at low latitudes it is dominated by the heat transport convergence, whereas at high latitudes it represents a small residual of changes in the surface flux and advection of heat. The structure of the horizontally integrated heat content tendency is set by the increase of downward heat flux by the mean circulation and comparable decrease of upward heat flux by the subgrid-scale processes; the upward eddy heat flux decreases and increases by almost the same magnitude in response to, respectively, the \u201cthermal\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d forcing. Regionally, the surface heat loss and deep convection weaken in the Labrador Sea, but intensify in the Greenland Sea in the region of sea ice retreat. The enhanced heat flux anomaly in the subpolar Atlantic is mainly caused by the \u201cthermal\u201d forcing.\n",

Here we adapt a method of deriving sea ice freeboard from CryoSat-2 to data from the AltiKa Ka band radar altimeter over the 2013\u201314 Arctic sea ice growth season. AltiKa measures basin-averaged freeboards between 4.4\u00a0cm and 6.9\u00a0cm larger than CryoSat-2 in October and March, respectively. Using airborne laser and radar measurements from spring 2013 and 2014, we estimate the effective scattering horizon for each sensor. While CryoSat-2 echoes penetrate to the ice surface over first-year ice and penetrate the majority (82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%) of the snow layer over multiyear ice, AltiKa echoes are scattered from roughly the midpoint (46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%) of the snow layer over both ice types.\n",

Although several studies have investigated Arctic inversion characteristics such as height, depth, and frequency, there are significant challenges for long-term climate monitoring mainly due to limited sampling over the ocean and/or poor resolution of available observations. This study investigates the Arctic temperature inversion during the cold season using the high-resolution refractivity profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO). For the coldest and driest months in the Arctic, a reliable retrieval technique for boundary layer properties, such as inversion height and surface-based inversion (SBI) frequency, is developed. We find that these variables have a strong negative relationship over the Arctic Ocean and are well-correlated in the time and space domain. The spatial patterns show a minimum inversion height (maximum SBI frequency) over the ice-covered Pacific sector of the ocean similar to that observed in past studies. Seasonal evolution of the inversion characteristics suggests a surface temperature control over the sea ice region, with the peak in SBI frequency occurring during the transition period from winter to spring. There is little diurnal variability in the mean inversion height during the cold season. Despite its limitations, the RO refractivity profile is found quite useful for monitoring the Arctic boundary layer, including interannual variability of inversion characteristics.\n",

Using 1-meter resolution panchromatic satellite imagery paired with airborne and in situ data, we evaluated melt pond evolution for an entire melt season on drifting first-year and multiyear sea ice near the 2011 Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS) site in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. A new algorithm was developed to classify the imagery into sea ice, thin ice, melt pond, and open water classes on two contrasting ice types: first-year and multiyear sea ice. Surprisingly, melt ponds formed \u223c3 weeks earlier on multiyear ice. Both ice types had comparable mean snow depths, but multiyear ice had 0 - 5-cm deep snow covering \u223c37% of its surveyed area, which may have facilitated earlier melt due to its low surface albedo compared to thicker snow. Maximum pond fractions were 53\u2009\u00b1\u20093% and 38\u2009\u00b1\u20093% on first-year and multiyear ice, respectively. APLIS pond fractions were compared with those from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) field campaign. APLIS exhibited earlier melt and double the maximum pond fraction, which was in part due to the greater presence of thin snow and first-year ice at APLIS. These results reveal considerable differences in pond formation between ice types, and underscore the importance of snow depth distributions in the timing and progression of melt pond formation.

With the goal of improving radiative and heat flux estimates through sea ice in regional and global models without the need of detailed snow property descriptions, a new parameterization including subgrid-scale snow thickness variability is presented. One-parameter snow thickness distributions depending only on the gridbox-mean snow thickness are introduced resulting in analytical solutions for the fluxes of heat and light through the snow layer. As the snowpack melts, these snow thickness distributions ensure a smooth seasonal transition of the light field under sea ice. Spatially homogenous melting applied to an inhomogeneous distribution of snow thicknesses allows the appearance of bare sea ice areas and melt ponds before all snow has melted. In comparison to uniform-thickness snow used in previous models, the bias in the under sea-ice light field is halved with this parameterization. Model results from a one-dimensional ocean turbulence model coupled with a thermodynamic sea ice model are compared to observations near Resolute in the Canadian High Arctic. The simulations show substantial improvements not only to the light field at the sea ice base which will affect ice algal growth but also to the sea ice and seasonal snowpack evolution. During melting periods, the snowpack can survive longer while sea ice thickness starts to reduce earlier.\n",

While the Earth system continues to accumulate energy due to anthropogenic and other radiative forcings, estimates of recent surface temperature evolution fall at the lower end of climate model projections. Global mean temperatures from climate model simulations are typically calculated using surface air temperatures, while the corresponding observations are based on a blend of air and sea surface temperatures. This work quantifies a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. A further bias arises from the treatment of temperatures in regions where the sea ice boundary has changed. Applying the methodology of the HadCRUT4 record to climate model temperature fields accounts for 38% of the discrepancy in trend between models and observations over the period 1975\u20132014.\n",

The samples represent a wide range of salinities and \u03b418O values due to river water inputs and sea ice removal. We estimate the fraction of water that has been removed as ice by interpreting observed \u03b418O values and salinities as a result of mixing between river water and sea water end-members as well as to fractional ice removal. This method does not assume an ice end-member of fixed composition, which is especially important when applied on samples with large differences in salinity. The results show that there is net transport of ice from both the Laptev and the Eastern Siberian Seas, and in total 3000 km\u00b3 of sea ice is exported from the shelf. The annual total export of ice from the entire region, calculated from the residence time of water on the shelf, is estimated to be 860 km3 yr\u22121.

The methodologies are Absolute Deviation, Root Mean Square Deviation, Mean Displacement, Hausdorff Distance, and Modified Hausdorff Distance. The methodologies are employed to quantify similarity between spatial distribution of the simulated and control scalar fields providing measures of model performance. To analyze their response to dissimilarities in 2-dimensional fields (contours), the metrics undergo sensitivity tests (scale, rotation, translation, and noise). Furthermore, in order to assess their ability to quantify resemblance of 3-dimensional fields the metrics are subjected to sensitivity tests where tested fields have continuous random spatial patterns inside the contours. The Modified Hausdorff Distance approach demonstrates the best response to tested differences, with the other methods limited by weak responses to scale and translation. Both Hausdorff Distance and Modifed Hausdorff Distance metrics are robust to noise, as opposed to the other methods. The metrics are then employed in realistic cases that validate sea ice concentration fields from numerical models and sea ice mean outlook against control data and observations. The Modified Hausdorff Distance method again exhibits high skill in quantifying similarity between both 2-dimensional (ice contour) and 3-dimensional (ice concentration) sea ice fields. The study demonstrates that the Modified Hausdorff Distance is a mathematically tractable and efficient method for model skill assessment and comparison providing effective and objective evaluation of both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional sea ice characteristics across data sets.

The position record indicates the landlocked season was approximately 5 months, from 18 January to 22 June, when the sea ice was fast to Melville Island and Victoria Island. Thermal stresses (ranging from \u221284 to 66 kPa) dominate the internal stress record, with only a few dynamic stress events (\u223c50 kPa) recorded before the landlocked season. Intriguingly, the thermal stresses are isotropic before the landlocked ice onset and anisotropic during the landlocked season. Two possible causes to explain anisotropy in thermal stresses are considered: preferred c axis alignment of the ice crystal, and land confinement associated with the nearby coastline. The orientation of the principal stresses indicates that land confinement is responsible for the anisotropy. The stress record also clearly shows the presence of residual compressive stresses at the melt onset, suggesting a viscous creep relaxation time constant of several days. Finally, results show an interesting reversal in the sign of the correlation (from negative to positive) between surface air temperature and thermal stress after the onset of surface melt. We attribute this to the onset of water infiltration within sea ice after which colder night temperature leads to refreezing and compressive stresses. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that anisotropic thermal stresses have been reported in sea ice.\n",

Results show that when increased aerosol loading is found on the Himalayas slopes in the pre-monsoon period (April-May), intensification of early monsoon rainfall over India and increased low-level westerly flow follow, in agreement with the Elevated-Heat-Pump mechanism. The increase in rainfall during the early monsoon season has a cooling effect on the land surface. In the same period, enhanced surface cooling may also be amplified through solar dimming by more cloudiness and aerosol loading, via increased dust transported by low-level westerly flow. The surface cooling causes subsequent reduction in monsoon rainfall in July-August over India. The time-lagged nature of the reasonably realistic response of the model to aerosol forcing suggests that absorbing aerosols, besides their potential key roles in impacting monsoon water cycle and climate, may influence the seasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon.\n",

We estimate probability density functions, the annual cycle, and map the 50th and 99th percentile winds. We then perform the same statistical analysis of winds for 2\u2009years when 10\u2009km WRF data are available (June 2005 to May 2007); despite the much shorter time period, the Pan-Arctic statistics are very similar to those from the 18\u2009year analysis. We repeat the wind speed statistical analysis within a subdomain surrounding Greenland and find that WRF10 has consistently larger maximum wind speeds, but this difference only appears at wind speed percentiles higher than 99%. Differences in the 99th percentile wind speeds are spatially heterogeneous. An investigation of surface fluxes within WRF50 and WRF10 reveals unrealistically large sensible heat fluxes along the sea ice edge, and the geographic distribution and magnitude of these fluxes is shown to be sensitive to sea ice representation in WRF.",

Locally absorbed summer solar heat is stored in a near-surface temperature maximum (NSTM) layer underlying the mixed layer. The heat content of the NSTM layer was anomalously large following summer 2007, which saw considerable sea ice losses and intense solar absorption into the exposed surface ocean. Measurements provide evidence for the entrainment of NSTM layer heat in fall/winter 2007\u20132008 by shear-driven mixing, and convective mixing by the release of dense, salty plumes during sea ice growth. While at least a portion of the NSTM layer was eroded, deeper warm ocean layers remained unaffected. It is shown that the release of solar heat stored following summer 2007 was sufficient to have reduced sea ice thickness at the end of the 2008 growth season by about 25%.\n",

Many of the functional relationships describing biological rate processes, such as primary productivity, in marine ecosystem models are nonlinear functions of environmental state variables. As a result of nonlinearity, rate processes computed from mean fields at coarse resolution will differ from similar computations that incorporate small-scale heterogeneity. Here we examine how subgrid-scale variability in sea ice thickness impacts simulated net primary productivity (NPP) in a \n1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 configuration of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). CESM simulates a subgrid-scale ice thickness distribution and computes shortwave penetration independently for each ice thickness category. However, the default model formulation uses grid-cell mean irradiance to compute NPP. We demonstrate that accounting for subgrid-scale shortwave heterogeneity by computing light limitation terms under each ice category then averaging the result is a more accurate invocation of the photosynthesis equations. Moreover, this change delays seasonal bloom onset and increases interannual variability in NPP in the sea ice zone in the model. The new treatment reduces annual production by about 32% in the Arctic and 19% in the Antarctic. Our results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in physical fields when integrating nonlinear biogeochemical reactions.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe observed changes in physical properties of sea ice such as decreased thickness and increased melt pond cover severely impact the energy budget of Arctic sea ice. Increased light transmission leads to increased deposition of solar energy in the upper ocean and thus plays a crucial role for amount and timing of sea-ice-melt and under-ice primary production. Recent developments in underwater technology provide new opportunities to study light transmission below the largely inaccessible underside of sea ice. We measured spectral under-ice radiance and irradiance using the new Nereid Under-Ice (NUI) underwater robotic vehicle, during a cruise of the R/V Polarstern to 83\u00b0N 6\u00b0W in the Arctic Ocean in July 2014. NUI is a next generation hybrid remotely operated vehicle (H-ROV) designed for both remotely-piloted and autonomous surveys underneath land-fast and moving sea ice. Here we present results from one of the first comprehensive scientific dives of NUI employing its interdisciplinary sensor suite. We combine under-ice optical measurements with three dimensional under-ice topography (multibeam sonar) and aerial images of the surface conditions. We investigate the influence of spatially varying ice-thickness and surface properties on the spatial variability of light transmittance during summer. Our results show that surface properties such as melt ponds dominate the spatial distribution of the under-ice light field on small scales (<1000m2), while sea ice-thickness is the most important predictor for light transmission on larger scales. In addition, we propose the use of an algorithm to obtain histograms of light transmission from distributions of sea ice thickness and surface albedo. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nPublished reconstructions of radiocarbon in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean indicate that there is a mid-depth maximum in radiocarbon age during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This is in contrast to the modern ocean where intense mixing between water masses results in a relatively homogenous radiocarbon profile. Ferrari et al. (2014) suggested that the extended Antarctic sea ice cover during the LGM necessitated a shallower boundary between the upper and lower branches of the meridional overturning circulation. This shoaled boundary lay above major topographic features associated with strong diapycnal mixing, isolating dense southern sourced water in the lower branch of the overturning circulation. This isolation would have allowed radiocarbon to decay and thus provides a possible explanation for the mid-depth radiocarbon age bulge. We test this hypothesis using an idealized, 2-D, residual-mean dynamical model of the global overturning circulation. Concentration distributions of a decaying tracer that is advected by the simulated overturning are compared to published radiocarbon data. We find that a 600\u2009km (~5\u00b0 of latitude) increase in sea ice extent shoals the boundary between the upper and lower branches of the overturning circulation at 45\u00b0S by 600\u2009m and shoals the depth of North Atlantic Deep Water convection at 50\u00b0N by 2500\u2009m. This change in circulation configuration alone decreases the radiocarbon content in the mid-depth South Atlantic at 45\u00b0S by 40\u2030, even without an increase in surface radiocarbon age in the source region of deep waters during the LGM.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA three-dimensional sea ice model is presented with resolved snow thickness variations and melt ponds. The model calculates heating from solar radiative transfer and simulates the formation and movement of brine/melt water through the ice system. Initialization for the model is based on observations of snow topography made during the summer melt seasons of 2009, 2010, and 2012 from a location off the coast of Barrow, AK. Experiments are conducted to examine the importance of snow properties and snow and ice thickness by comparing observed and modeled pond fraction and albedo. One key process simulated by the model is the formation of frozen layers in the ice as relatively warm fresh water grid cells freeze when cooled by adjacent, cold brine-filled grid cells. These layers prevent vertical drainage and lead to flooding of melt water commonly observed at the beginning of the melt season. Flooding persists until enough heat is absorbed to melt through the frozen layer. The resulting long-term melt pond coverage is sensitive to both the spatial variability of snow cover and the minimum snow depth. For thin snow cover, initial melting results in earlier, reduced flooding with a small change in pond fraction after drainage of the melt water. Deeper snow tends to generate a delayed, larger peak pond fraction before drainage.\n",

We first review the opportunities to use a hierarchy of different types of experiment to learn about the predictability of Arctic climate. We also examine key issues for ensemble system design, such as: measuring skill, the role of ensemble size and generation of ensemble members. When assessing the potential skill of a set of prediction experiments, using more than one metric is essential as different choices can significantly alter conclusions about the presence or lack of skill. We find that increasing both the number of hindcasts and ensemble size is important for reliably assessing the correlation and expected error in forecasts. For other metrics, such as dispersion, increasing ensemble size is most important. Probabilistic measures of skill can also provide useful information about the reliability of forecasts. In addition, various methods for generating the different ensemble members are tested. The range of techniques can produce surprisingly different ensemble spread characteristics. The lessons learnt should help inform the design of future operational prediction systems.\n",

Our results suggest that \u03b418Odiat values are primarily influenced by changes in freshwater discharge from the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS), while corresponding \u03b430Sidiat are primarily influenced by changes in Si supply to surface waters. Our data indicate enhanced glacial to mid Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) NE Pacific surface water stratification, generally limiting the Si supply to surface waters. However, we suggest that an increase in Si supply during early HS1, when surface waters were still stratified, is linked to increased North Pacific Intermediate Water formation. The coincidence between fresh surface waters during HS1 and enhanced ice-rafted debris sedimentation in the North Atlantic indicates a close link between CIS and Laurentide Ice Sheet dynamics and a dominant atmospheric control on CIS deglaciation. The B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d (B/A) is characterized by destratification in the subarctic Pacific and an increased supply of saline, Si-rich waters to surface waters. This change toward increased convection occurred prior to the B\u00f8lling warming and is likely triggered by a switch to sea ice-free conditions during late HS1. Our results furthermore indicate a decreased efficiency of the biological pump during late HS1 and the B/A (possibly also the Younger Dryas), suggesting that the subarctic Pacific has then been a source region of atmospheric CO2.\n",

While the variability and trends in anticyclonic circulation patterns (including blocking) over Greenland have been previously documented, an analysis of the most extreme blocking events within the observational record is lacking. In this study, a historical climatology of extreme Greenland blocking episodes (GBEs) from 1958 to 2013 is examined within the context of anomalous anticyclonic circulation patterns over the North Atlantic region during recent years. Based on a combination of the ERA-40 (1958\u20131978) and ERA-Interim (1979\u20132013) reanalysis data sets, the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) is used to quantify 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies for the identification of extreme GBEs. The annual rate of extreme blocking days has doubled since 1958, reaching an average of approximately 20 days per year by 2013. The frequency and, to some extent, duration of extreme GBEs were unprecedentedly high from 2007 to 2013 compared to the 56-year period of record, with a majority of the increase occurring during the spring (MAM) and summer (JJA). A multiple linear regression analysis reveals that interannual variability in extreme blocking and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) are the two predominant drivers of surface meltwater production across the entire Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), but Arctic sea ice extent and North Atlantic cyclone activity can also influence the extent of summer melting over portions of the GrIS. Thus, in addition to the larger-scale atmospheric and oceanic variability, smaller-scale features such as extratropical cyclones can play a significant role in modulating GrIS surface melting each summer.\n",

Among other factors, sea ice is sensitive to the ocean heat flux. In this study, we use in situ oceanographic, sea ice, and meteorological data collected during winter 2013/2014 in Young Sound (YS) fjord in Northeast Greenland to estimate the ocean heat flux to the landfast ice cover. During the preceding ice-free summer, incident solar radiation caused sea surface temperatures of up to 5\u20136\u00b0C. Subsequently, this heat was transferred down to the intermediate depths, but returned to the surface and retarded ice growth throughout winter. Two different approaches were used to estimate the ocean heat fluxes; (i) a residual method based on a 1-D thermodynamic ice growth model and (ii) a bulk parameterization using friction velocities and available heat content of water beneath the ice. The average heat flux in the inner YS varied from 13 W m\u22122 in October\u2013December to less than 2 W m\u22122 in January\u2013May. An average heat flux of 9 W m\u22122 was calculated for the outer YS. Moreover, we show that the upward heat flux in the outer fjord is strongly modulated by surface outflow, which produced two maxima in heat flux (up to 18\u201324 W m\u22122) during 26 December to 27 January and from 11 February to 14 March. By May 2014, the upward ocean heat flux reduced the landfast ice thickness by 18% and 24% in the inner and outer YS, respectively.\n",

Using an isentropic framework, a novel diagnostic based on the tendency equation for the slope of isentropic surfaces \u2013 a measure of the potential for baroclinic development \u2013 is presented. The tendency comprises contributions from dynamic processes, latent heat release, radiation, and sub-gridscale turbulence, which incorporates the effect of sensible heat fluxes. A climatology of these tendencies over the North Atlantic is compiled for the winters 2009 and 2010.\nIt is found that adiabatic tilting flattens the isentropic surfaces, reflecting the action of growing baroclinic cyclones. This tendency is climatologically balanced by the generation of slope by diabatic processes. In the lower troposphere, the most intense diabatic increase of slope is found along the oceanic frontal zone associated with the Gulf Stream and at higher latitudes in the Labrador Sea, the Nordic Seas and the Barents Sea. Latent heat release and sensible heat fluxes both contribute substantially in these regions. A quantitative analysis of cold air outbreaks emphasises their important role for restoring the slope in the lower troposphere over the Gulf Stream region and off the sea-ice edge at high latitudes. In the upper troposphere, latent heat release due to cloud microphysical processes is the dominant mechanism maintaining the slope.\n",

The aircraft campaign STABLE aimed to improve our current understanding of the formation of convective plumes over leads and their impact on the polar atmospheric boundary layer. It was carried out over the pack ice in the northern Fram Strait in March 2013. We present case studies of the boundary layer modification and turbulent fluxes over four wide leads, which differed strongly with respect to lead characteristics and environmental conditions. The observed near-surface sensible heat fluxes ranged from 15 to 180 W m\u22122. The leads also induced an increase of the near-surface temperature of up to 3.2 \u00b0C and a humidity increase of up to 0.2 g kg\u22121. In one of the cases, large entrainment fluxes exceeding 30% of the surface fluxes were observed. Vertical profiles of turbulent sensible heat and momentum fluxes were nonlinear downstream of the leads with a distinct flux maximum in the core of the convective plumes. In two cases, the plumes also strongly affected the wind field within the atmospheric boundary layer. Low-level jets that existed in those cases in the region upstream of the leads disappeared in the plume region. Finally, it is shown that large errors can occur when flux measurements are derived from lead orthogonal flight legs only. Therefore, complex flight patterns, as presented in this study, are necessary to accurately determine the energy fluxes in the environment of leads.\n",

This article presents the verification of ice forecast skill from a new system implemented recently at the Canadian Meteorological Centre called the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS). GIOPS provides daily global ice and ocean analyses and 10-day forecasts on a 1/4\u00b0-resolution grid. GIOPS includes a multivariate ocean data assimilation system that combines satellite observations of sea-level anomaly and sea-surface temperature (SST) together with in situ observations of temperature and salinity. Ice analyses are produced using a 3D-Var method that assimilates satellite observations from SSM/I and SSMIS together with manual analyses from the Canadian Ice Service. Analyses of total ice concentration are projected onto the thickness categories used in the ice model using spatially and temporally varying weighting functions derived from ice model tendencies. This method may reduce deleterious impacts on the ice thickness distribution when assimilating ice concentration, as it can directly modulate (and reverse) nonlinear processes such as ice deformation. An objective verification of sea ice forecasts is made using two methods: analysis-based error assessment focusing on the marginal ice zone, and a contingency table approach to evaluate ice extent as compared to an independent analysis. Together the methods demonstrate a consistent picture of skilful medium-range forecasts in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as compared to persistence. Using the contingency table approach, GIOPS forecasts show a significant open-water bias during spring and summer. However, this bias depends on the choice of threshold used. Ice forecast skill is found to be highly sensitive to the assimilation of SST near the ice edge. Improved observational coverage in these areas (including salinity) would be extremely valuable for further improvement in ice forecast skill.\n",

These constituents have received relatively little attention because their contribution to the slow climatic manifold is controversial in comparison to that of the large heat capacity of the oceans. Furthermore, their initialization as well as their representation in state-of-the-art climate models remains a challenge. Numerous extraoceanic processes that could be active over the decadal range are proposed. Potential predictability associated with the aforementioned, poorly represented, and scarcely observed constituents of the climate system has been primarily inspected through numerical simulations performed under idealized experimental settings. The impact, however, on practical decadal predictions, conducted with realistically initialized full-fledged climate models, is still largely unexploited. Enhancing initial-value predictability through an improved model initialization appears to be a viable option for land surface, sea ice, and, marginally, the stratosphere. Similarly, capturing future aerosol emission storylines might lead to an improved representation of both global and regional short-term climatic changes. In addition to these factors, a key role on the overall predictive ability of ESMs is expected to be played by an accurate representation of processes associated with specific components of the climate system. These act as \u201csignal carriers,\u201d transferring across the climatic phase space the information associated with the initial state and boundary forcings, and dynamically bridging different (otherwise unconnected) subsystems. Through this mechanism, Earth system components trigger low-frequency variability modes, thus extending the predictability beyond the seasonal scale.\n",

        "description": "\n\nDrought is one of the most devastating natural disasters occurring in the Yellow River basin (YRB) in Central and North China, with strong impacts on human societies and natural environments. Based on datasets from ECMWF/ERA-Interim on atmospheric circulation and sea level pressure and on rainfall data from meteorological networks from 1979 to 2013, droughts in the YRB are investigated in the present work. Rainfall in summer in the northern YRB (semi-arid and semi-humid zones) has been low since 1990, which is associated with an anomaly of planetary waves around Lake Baikal. These waves are significantly affected by Arctic ice loss (particularly in the eastern Arctic) among other factors. Eastern Arctic ice loss results in a warmer surface and increases air temperatures over the Arctic and northern Siberia. These conditions are favourable for cyclonic anomalies in the lower troposphere, generating an ascending flow anomaly over the eastern Arctic and a positive anomaly of meridional wind in the low troposphere between high latitudes and the Arctic. This situation results in a weaker Polar cell and a stronger Ferrel cell in the three-cell latitudinal circulation, due to increasing the ascending flow at approximately 60\u00b0N as well as the descending flow at approximately 35\u00b0\u201353\u00b0N. These conditions favour reinforcement as well as the width of subtropical high pressures, meridional shifts or northward elongation, the anomaly of planetary wave ridges around Lake Baikal, finally, more severe droughts in the northern YRB. Simulations performed with an atmospheric general circulation model confirm that Arctic sea ice loss can induce a northward shift and enhancement of subtropical high pressures, together with decreasing rainfall in the mid-latitudes of both North America and East Asia, especially in the northern YRB.\n",

        "description": "The snow surface on thick multiyear sea ice in winter is on average colder than the air because of the negative radiation balance. Beneath the snow surface there is a strong temperature gradient in winter with increasing temperatures towards the ice\u2013water interface temperature at the freezing point around \u20131.8 \u00b0C. The sea ice surface temperature and the thermal microwave brightness temperature were simulated using a combination of thermodynamic and microwave emission models.The simulations indicate that the physical snow\u2013ice interface temperature or alternatively the 6 GHz effective temperature have a good correlation with the effective temperature at the temperature sounding channels near 50 GHz. The complete correlation matrix based on the simulations for physical and effective temperatures is given.The physical snow\u2013ice interface temperature is related to the brightness temperature at 6 GHz vertical polarization as expected. However, the emissivity factor normally used when converting brightness temperature to the ice temperature is dependent on the ice temperature. The simulations indicate that a simple model may be used to derive the snow-ice interface temperature from satellite AMSR 6 GHz measurements.",
