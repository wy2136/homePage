The relationship is strong and statistically significant during 1968\u20131986, but becomes weak during 1989\u20132007. The spring AOrelated SST, atmospheric dynamic, and thermodynamic conditions are compared between the two epochs to understand the possible reasons for the change in the relationship. Results indicate that the spring AO leads to an El Ni\u02dcno-like SST anomaly, lower-level anomalous cyclonic circulation, upper-level anomalous anticyclonic circulation, enhanced ascending motion, and a positive midlevel relative humidity anomaly in the tropical western\u2013central Pacific during 1968\u20131986, whereas the AOrelated anomalies in the above quantities are weak during 1989\u20132007. Hence, the large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies are more favorable for TC formation over the eastern WNP during 1968\u20131986 than during 1989\u20132007.</p>\n                  ",

We show that there are two possible mechanisms responsible for this interannual remote linkage. One is an Arctic mechanism. Extensive Arctic sea ice in the summer after a negative NAO acts as a bridge to the positive phase of the WP in the next winter. The other mechanism involves the tropics. An El Ni\u00f1o occurrence after a negative winter NAO acts as another bridge to the positive phase of the WP in the following winter. The timescale of the Arctic route is nearly decadal, whereas that of the tropical route is about 3\u20135\u00a0years. The tropical mechanism indicates that the NAO remotely excites an El Ni\u00f1o in the second half of the following year. A process perhaps responsible for the El Ni\u00f1o occurrence was investigated statistically. A negative NAO in the winter increases Eurasian snow cover. This anomalous snow cover then intensifies the cold air outbreak from Asia to the western tropical Pacific. This outbreak can intensify the westerly wind burst and excite El Ni\u00f1o in the following year. We suggest that the phase of the NAO in the winter could be a predictor of the WP in the following year.\n      </p>\n                  ",

This climate anomaly is part of a recent trend towards negative values of the NAO index that has occurred over recent winters. The negative trend of the NAO may be related to atmospheric internal variability but\u00a0it may also be partly forced by slowly varying components of the climate system. In the present study, we investigate the influence of surface conditions on the atmospheric circulation for the 2012\u20132013 winter using an atmospheric global climate model. In particular, the role of low Arctic sea ice concentration, warm tropical/North Atlantic sea surface temperature and positive Siberian snow cover anomalies are isolated by prescribing them in a set of different numerical experiments. Our simulations suggest that each of these surface forcings favored a negative NAO during the 2012\u20132013 winter. In our model, the combined NAO response to tropical/North Atlantic SST, Arctic sea ice and Siberian snow anomalies accounts for about 30\u00a0% of the observed NAO anomaly. Different physical mechanisms are explored to elucidate the atmospheric responses and are shown to involve both tropical and extratropical processes.</p>\n                  ",

Such an SSTA pattern can be regarded as a response to the atmospheric forcing of the preceding January\u2013February\u2013March North Atlantic Oscillation. Numerical experiment results from both linear baroclinic model with an idealized diabatic heating profile and an atmospheric general circulation model with prescribed SSTA forcing demonstrate that the warm core alone of the tripole pattern can stimulate a steady downstream Rossby wave train, which further intensifies the spring WJ over the TP. As a result, a positive anomaly of surface sensible heating occurs over most parts of the TP, whereas the precipitation and corresponding latent heating is characterized by a seesaw pattern with a positive/negative anomaly over the northern/southern TP. Meanwhile, the air column radiation cooling effect is enhanced to a certain degree over the plateau. Further analysis suggests that the early spring SSTA over the North Atlantic may exert a seasonal-lagged impact upon the East Asian summer monsoon by modulating the thermal forcing over the TP.</p>\n                  ",

Therefore, the peninsula is particularly sensitive to climate change owing to frequent periods of precipitation deficit together with societal dependence on water. In this study, we address meteorological droughts of the peninsula between 1901 and 2010, using the Global Precipitation Climatology Center database. First, we carried out a statistical classification of the peninsula according to annual precipitation cycle. The spatiotemporal variability of droughts was evaluated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) by determining the evolution of areas affected by severe and extreme drought. Subsequently, we calculated the overall trend of precipitation and anomalies to investigate whether an observed drought increase is attributable to a decrease of precipitation or an increase of precipitation extremes. Finally, we examined periodicities of precipitation anomalies via wavelet analysis, relating these to large-scale modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results show an increase in the area affected by severe and extreme drought, particularly on Atlantic-facing slopes. The mainland areas have longer and more intense periods of drought, with an average SPI of \u2212<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>0.52 and 4-month duration. Over the 110<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years analyzed, we observed weak trends of annual precipitation in the extreme northwest and southern IP. However, in the last decades of the series, long periods of strong negative anomalies are seen, interspersed with years of strong positive anomalies, suggesting an increase in precipitation pattern extremes. Finally, the relationship between the NAO index and precipitation anomalies on the Atlantic seaboard is highlighted. Thus, in both series we found a 5\u20136-year periodicity in their first years, with a diminishing cycle period reaching a periodicity of 2\u20133<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years in the final years. This confirms the existence of regular temporal cycles in which droughts alternate with wet periods modulated by large-scale modes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

The goal of the study was to analyze the impact of these changes on the magnitude and timing of winter maximum daily flows. Hydrologic series for seventeen tributaries of the St. Lawrence River were analyzed over the period from 1934 to 2010. The most noteworthy result, obtained using the Lombard method, was to highlight a nearly generalized shift in mean values of the series in the early 1970s. This shift reflects a significant increase in the magnitude of winter maximum daily flows after that decade, interpreted to result primarily from snowmelt, which is increasingly frequent at the end of winter. The frequency of the dates of occurrence of winter maximum daily flows increased significantly during the last winter decade (ten days) after the 1970s for most rivers in southern Quebec. The copula method did not, however, reveal any significant change in the dependency between the timing and magnitude of winter maximum daily flows over time. Finally, canonical correlation analysis revealed that the magnitude of winter maximum daily flows is positively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while their dates of occurrence are correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

By comparing a network of surface temperature reconstructions with output from a coupled global climate model, we find that, through a system of land-atmosphere feedbacks, the end of the AHP reduced the atmospheric and oceanic poleward heat transport from tropical to high northern latitudes. This entails a general weakening of the mid-latitude Westerlies, which results in a shift towards cooling over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions, and a change from positive to negative Arctic Oscillation-like conditions. This mechanism would explain the sign of rapid hydro-climatic perturbations recorded in several reconstructions from high northern latitudes at 5.5\u20135.0\u00a0kyr\u00a0BP, suggesting that these regions are sensitive to changes in Saharan land cover during the present interglacial.

Here we focus on SSTs from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and report a 99% significant correlation between the changes of in situ measured AMOC transport and the variation of 1-month leading SST anomalies in the subpolar North Atlantic region (45\u00b0N\u201370\u00b0N) based on analyses of an 85-month period. The leading mode of the singular value decomposition analysis of SST and Sea Level Pressure (SLP) for 31<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>years (1981/12\u20132012/12) shows an apparent North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing on the SST fields. Specifically, the SST and SLP one-month phase lag covariance is notable at temporal scales of 4 to 11<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>months. After removing the first order component of the NAO, the residual SST (RESST) provides better estimates of the AMOC on a shorter time scale than the SST. This is because that RESST is less likely to be affected by the local SLP on these time scales. The high correlation is primarily between the RESST and variations of the geostrophic Upper Mid-Ocean transport component of the AMOC. The 31-year RESST time series in the North Atlantic subpolar region is also significantly correlated with the Gulf Stream path SST anomalies with a one-month lead, implying a fast signal transport from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Gulf Stream. A similar fast adjustment signal is also found in 500-year control simulations of the GFDL model CM2.1. These results indicate a prospective capability of satellite-derived SSTs to predict AMOC variability.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

In the North Pacific, contrasting anomalies were also present, with a straight zonal Pacific jet in 2010 and a strong poleward deviation of the Pacific jet in its exit region in 2014. Using reanalysis data sets and adopting a nonlinear initial-value approach with a quasi-geostrophic model, we show that the Pacific-North American anomalies are responsible for shaping synoptic wave trains propagating across North America. This in turn largely determines the nature of wave breaking and the synoptic eddy feedback onto the mean flow in the North Atlantic and finally the NAO phase. In such a proposed mechanism, synoptic wave activity forms the cornerstone of the dynamical relationship between the North Pacific and North Atlantic large-scale anomalies during the contrasting winters of 2010 and 2014.\n",

We assess atmospheric and oceanic drivers responsible for this extreme event. In terms of atmospheric drivers, mild Bothnian Bay winters are characterized by positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) associated with the advection of air from the North Atlantic. In winter 2014/15, NAO was at a record high level and resulted in a northerly storm track associated with vigorous southwesterlies that drove ice towards the northeastern end of the bay. Furthermore, we found that the 1985-2015 Baltic Sea ice extent distribution differs from any other preceding thirty-winter period since 1720 with a high confidence. Based on climate projections, it is very likely that in the next fifty years partially ice-free Bothnian Bay will go from being an extremely rare event to a new normal.\n",

Five cores of strong ISV emerge, with standard deviation reaching about 1\u00b0C in frontal areas of the three main upwelling systems: equatorial, Angola-Benguela and Senegal-Mauritania (the southern side of the Canary upwelling). West of 10\u00b0W along the equator, a 20-60-day peak caused by tropical instability waves is shown to generate surface wind anomalies through the adjustment of the horizontal surface pressure gradient in addition to the modification of near-surface atmospheric stratification. East of 10\u00b0W along the equator, an intense biweekly oscillation increases the ocean and atmosphere ISV. In the two coastal upwelling fronts, intraseasonal SST anomalies resemble each other. They are shown to be influenced by coastal Kelvin waves in addition to large-scale wind forcing. Over the Angola-Benguela upwelling, coastal wind bursts controlling the SST ISV are associated with anomalously strong pressure patterns related to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, the St. Helena anticyclone, and the Antarctic Oscillation. In the Senegal-Mauritania upwelling, the wind anomalies mainly linked to the Azores anticyclone in the southern front during November to May appear to be connected to the Saharan heat low in the northern front from June to September. In all five regions and as expected for such upwelling regimes, vertical oceanic mixing represents the dominant term in the mixed-layer heat budget. In the equatorial band, as found in previous studies, horizontal advection is equally important, while it appears surprisingly weak in coastal fronts. Finally, a striking result is the general lack of surface wind signal related to the SST ISV in the coastal upwellings.\n",

However, there have been few studies regarding the trends, including their spatial patterns, in ice phenology for individual waterbodies on a local or small regional scale, although the coherence of ice phenology has been shown to decline rapidly in the first few hundred kilometers. In this study, we extracted trends, analyzed affecting factors, and investigated relevant spatial patterns for ice breakup date time series at ten locations with record length \u2265\u200590 years in south-central Ontario, Canada. Wavelet methods, including the multi-resolution analysis (MRA) method for non-linear trend extraction and the wavelet coherence (WTC) method for identifying the teleconnections between large-scale climate modes and ice breakup date, are proved to be effective in ice phenology analysis. Using MRA method, the overall trend of ice breakup date time series (1905-1991) varied from earlier ice breakup to later ice breakup, then to earlier breakup again from south to north in south-central Ontario. Ice breakup date is closely correlated with air temperature during certain winter/spring months, as well as the last day with snow on the ground and number of snow-on-ground days. The influences of solar activity and Pacific North American (PNA) on ice breakup were comparatively uniform across south-central Ontario, while those of El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) on ice phenology changed with distance of 50\u2005\u2013\u2005100 km in the north\u2013south direction.\n",

The application of a set of statistical methods shows that a response of November sea level pressure (SLP) to the preceding wintertime AO operates on a hemispheric scale. At high and middle latitudes, this response is a well-pronounced seesaw in SLP between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Winters of the positive AO polarity tend to be followed by positive SLP anomalies spanning the whole Northern Eurasia and negative SLP anomalies extending from the Bering Sea through the Western North Atlantic. Opposite SLP anomalies prevail after winters of the negative AO polarity. The response of November SLP to the preceding wintertime AO closely resembles the first empirical orthogonal function of November SLP. That is, the polarity of the wintertime AO precedes the polarity of the leading mode of variability of November SLP over the Northern Hemisphere. The wintertime AO exerts a 9-month lag impact on November circulation due to the re-emergence of a sea surface temperature anomaly over the western North Atlantic.\n",

The most notable variability associated with the AO/NAO was a northeast/southwest dipole feature across western Eurasia.

        "description": "\n\nIn this study the dependence between the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones over the North Atlantic is investigated. A cyclone track database of extended October to March winters was obtained from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Large positive correlation is found between winter cyclone counts and local sample mean vorticity over the exit region of the North Atlantic storm track in this cyclone track database. Conversely, negative correlation is found over the Gulf stream. Possible causes for the dependence are investigated by regressing winter cyclone counts and local sample mean vorticity on teleconnection indices with Poisson and linear models. The indices for the Scandinavian pattern, North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic Pattern are able to account for most of the observed positive correlation over the North Atlantic. To consider the implications of frequency intensity dependence for the insurance industry an aggregate risk metric was used as a proxy for the annual aggregate insured loss. Here the aggregate risk is defined as the sum of the intensities of all events occurring within a season. Assuming independence between the frequency and intensity results in large biases in the variance and the extremes of the aggregate risk, especially over Scandinavia. Therefore including frequency intensity dependence in extratropical cyclone loss models is necessary to model the risk of extreme losses.\n",

Clustering was estimated by calculating the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of 30 December\u2013February counts of Atlantic storm tracks passing near each grid point. Results from single historical simulations of 1975\u20132005 were compared to those from historical ERA40 reanalyses from 1958 to 2001 and single future model projections of 2069\u20132099 under the RCP4.5 climate change scenario.\nModels were generally able to capture the broad features in reanalyses reported previously: underdispersion/regularity (i.e. variance less than mean) in the western core of the Atlantic storm track surrounded by overdispersion/clustering (i.e. variance greater than mean) to the north and south and over Western Europe. Regression of counts onto North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices revealed that much of the overdispersion in the historical reanalyses and model simulations can be accounted for by NAO variability.\nFuture changes in dispersion were generally found to be small and not consistent across models. The overdispersion statistic, for any 30-year sample, is prone to large amounts of sampling uncertainty which obscures the climate change signal. For example, the projected increase in dispersion for storm counts near London in the CNRMCM5 model is 0.1 compared to a standard deviation of 0.25. Projected changes in the mean and variance of NAO are insufficient to create changes in overdispersion that are discernible above natural sampling variations.\n",

Cross-wavelet analysis is used to analyse the connection between the outputs of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The combined EMD and cross-wavelet methodology is used for the description of the connection between the annual mean streamflow of Quebec rivers and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO). The relationship between the two time series is analysed by cross-wavelet analysis at the level of the mode of oscillation extracted from the EMD algorithm. The resulting cross-spectra are obtained individually for 18 stations and show intermittent intensity in these relationships between 1970 and 1990 for different oscillation modes. To highlight its particularity, the present methodology is compared with the results of a similar combination of multiresolution analysis (MRA) and cross-wavelet analysis. It shows that EMD isolates clearer bands of frequencies than MRA. Finally, a multi-site analysis is proposed, which performs a principal component analysis of the cross-spectra. This analysis illustrates the evolution of the relationships according to the geographic location. Finally, the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology are discussed.\n",

Robust and significant solar signals are detected in Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT) and strong solar activity evidently warms most area of the continent. The spatial pattern of sea level pressure (SLP) responses to solar activity is similar but not identical to that of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Compared to the NAO, geographic distribution of solar-induced SLP anomalies shifts eastward, with significantly enhanced influences over northern Eurasia. Relatively weaker solar signals were also found in mid-to-upper troposphere. The spatial pattern of 500 hPa geopotential anomalies resembles a negative Scandinavia Teleconnection pattern and the 200 hPa subtropical jet is weakened, while zonal wind at high latitudes is enhanced due to strong solar activity.\nThe anomalous zonal circulations can be attributed to the \u201ctop-down\u201d mechanism. During high solar activity winters, an enhanced stratospheric zonal wind anomaly propagates downward, causing zonal wind anomalies in the troposphere. However, the \u201cbottom-up\u201d mechanisms may provide more reasonable explanations of the distinct solar influences on Eurasian climate. Solar-induced strong warm advection in lower atmosphere tends to increase SAT but decrease SLP, resulting in enhanced solar influences over northern Eurasia. Meanwhile, change in the land-ocean thermal contrast (LOTC) could also amplify the circulation anomaly. Inhomogeneous surface heating caused by anomalous solar activity modifies LOTC, which probably enhances the solar-induced circulation patterns. Such a positive feedback may potentially strengthen the solar influences.\n",

The modes considered are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian (EA/WR) pattern and the Scandinavian (SCAN) pattern. The wave dataset consists of buoys records, remote sensing altimetry observations and a numerical hindcast providing significant wave height (SWH), mean wave period (MWP) and mean wave direction (MWD) for the period 1989\u20132009. After evaluating the reliability of the hindcast, we focus on the impact of each mode on seasonal wave parameters and on the relative importance of wind-sea and swell components. Results demonstrate that the NAO and EA patterns are the most relevant, whereas EA/WR and SCAN patterns have a weaker impact on the North Atlantic wave climate variability. During their positive phases, both NAO and EA patterns are related to winter SWH at a rate that reaches 1\u2009m per unit index along the Scottish coast (NAO) and Iberian coast (EA) patterns. In terms of winter MWD, the two modes induce a counterclockwise shift of up to 65\u00b0 per negative NAO (positive EA) unit over west European coasts. They also increase the winter MWP in the North Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (up to 1\u2009s per unit NAO) and along the western coasts of Europe and North Africa (1\u2009s per unit EA). The impact of winter EA pattern on all wave parameters is mostly caused through the swell wave component.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOrganisms in montane environments are sensitive to fine-scale climatic variation associated with highly dissected topography, yet few studies have examined the sensitivity of different landscape positions to climate change. We downscaled biologically significant temperature variables to below-canopy 30\u2009m resolution and assessed temporal trends from 1980 to 2011 across elevation and topographic gradients in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP; Tennessee and North Carolina, USA) using a previously developed empirical model derived from a 120-sensor temperature network. Additionally, we assessed GSMNP climate trends from 1900 using six historical climate records from the region and an additional eight records from 1980, spanning the Park's elevation gradient. Regional temperatures increased through the 1980s and 1990s, but currently remain at or below those recorded in the early to mid-20th century and are strongly associated with different phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. In contrast, annual and growing season precipitation steadily rose during the past century. Landscape-scale analysis showed that rates of change for maximum seasonal temperatures, frost-free days (FFD), and growing degree days were strongly mediated by topographic position, with high-elevation ridges having greater rates of maximum temperature increases, whereas high-elevation near-stream positions showed the least amount of increase in FFD and growing degree days. Most importantly, we show how modelled differences in rates of climatic change based on landscape position could have significant ecological effects in this biologically significant region, depending on how organisms respond to particular climate factors. Organisms that depend on growing season length may experience the largest climate effects at the lowest elevations, while those that depend on warm days in spring and autumn for particular phenological processes will experience the largest shifts at high-elevation ridges.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis study investigated the potential connection of the October\u2013December Arctic Oscillation (AO-OND) with the following January East Asian temperature extremes and the possible mechanisms. It was found that the extreme cold (warm) events are less (more) frequent in January over East Asia following a positive phase of AO-OND, which might be attributed to the intrinsic persistence of AO-OND in stratosphere and the memory of Eurasian snow cover. It is revealed that the barotropic structure of AO-OND could extend to stratosphere. By the following January, wave activities propagate from stratosphere downwards to upper troposphere, then bent equatorwards to mid-latitudes. Consequently, the January circumpolar jet (polar vortex) gets strengthened (colder) because the equatorward-pointing (upwards) wave activities correspond to poleward meridional eddy momentum (eddy heat) flux. In such a way, the anomalous AO-OND persists into the following January. On the other hand, positive phase of AO-OND causes significant surface warming in most parts of Eurasia, leading to Eurasian snow melt. The October\u2013December snow melt has intrinsic climatic memory and further weakens the January Siberian High through reducing surface albedo. Besides, the surface warming in North Europe because of reduced surface albedo caused by snow melt could stimulate a Rossby wave train propagating eastwards across Eurasia, which restrains the blocking events around Ural region. In such a context, the incidence of extreme warm (cold) events over East Asia is more (less) frequent.\n",

However, few details are known regarding where, when, and how the freshwater transverses the vast Siberian shelf seas. This paper investigates the mechanism, variability, and pathways of the fresh Kara Sea outflow through Vilkitsky Strait toward the Laptev Sea. We utilize a high-resolution ocean model and recent shipboard observations to characterize the freshwater-laden Vilkitsky Strait Current (VSC), and shed new light on the little-studied region between the Kara and Laptev Seas, characterized by harsh ice conditions, contrasting water masses, straits, and a large submarine canyon. The VSC is 10\u201320 km wide, surface intensified, and varies seasonally (maximum from August to March) and interannually. Average freshwater (volume) transport is 500\u2009\u00b1\u2009120 km3 a\u22121 (0.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 Sv), with a baroclinic flow contribution of 50\u201390%. Interannual transport variability is explained by a storage-release mechanism, where blocking-favorable summer winds hamper the outflow and cause accumulation of freshwater in the Kara Sea. The year following a blocking event is characterized by enhanced transports driven by a baroclinic flow along the coast that is set up by increased freshwater volumes. Eventually, the VSC merges with a slope current and provides a major pathway for Eurasian river water toward the western Arctic along the Eurasian continental slope. Kara (and Laptev) Sea freshwater transport is not correlated with the Arctic Oscillation, but rather driven by regional summer pressure patterns.\n",

The model results are compared with satellite data and with data measured at two moored multiparametric buoys. The model reproduces the events of strong sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies described in the literature, for the northern and western coasts, and it helps to explain the connection between the IPC intensity, temperature, and salinity. By analyzing some specific winters, with different characteristics, it is confirmed that years of stronger IPC result in higher transport of heat and salt, and the development of positive anomalies of temperature and salinity. However, local air-sea fluxes are also important and explain the temperature and salinity anomalies observed in some of the winters. The interplay between the IPC transport, or advection, and the local heat and salt fluxes explain why the temperature and salinity anomalies may be in antiphase or uncorrelated with the IPC magnitude. It is shown that from November to January, the IPC magnitude depends mostly on the intensity of the southerly winds, and it has a significant negative correlation with the NAO index.\n",

The average model transport of ULSW decreases southward from 6.7 Sv at 53\u00b0N to 4.5 Sv at 45\u00b0N due to interior pathways. The largest fraction of the total ULSW volume transport goes around Flemish Cap within the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC, 72%) but a significant part goes through Flemish Pass (20%). At interannual timescales, the variability at Flemish Pass shows a distinct behavior when compared to the variability in the DWBC and to the upstream fluctuations. A running correlation method is applied to obtain the connection of the transport variability at Flemish Pass with several quantities, representative for different physical mechanisms: (1) the North Atlantic Oscillation index, (2) the Ekman transport, (3) the rate of ULSW formation in the Labrador Sea, (4) the position of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) relative to the slope and (5) the averaged transport in the subpolar gyre. Weakened or strengthened transport of ULSW through Flemish Pass coincides with changes of the atmospheric forcing or with changes of the NAC\u2018s position. Strong meandering of the NAC close to the DWBC reduces the transport off Flemish Cap, and the ULSW flow is \u201credirected\u201d into the Flemish Pass, enhancing the transport there. In contrast, the transport variability in the DWBC is mainly caused by upstream fluctuations and changes according to the rate of ULSW formation.\n",

A weak AMOC and its associated reduced northward oceanic heat transport are associated with a cooling of the ENA Ocean, whereas the TNA cooling is attributable to both weak AMOC and surface heat flux. The cold biases in the ENA and TNA have remote impacts on the SST bias in the North Pacific. Here we use coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments to show the mechanisms and pathways by which the ENA and TNA affect the North Pacific. The model simulations demonstrate that the cooling SST bias in the North Pacific is largely due to the remote effect of the cooling SST bias in the ENA, while the remote impact of the TNA cooling SST bias is of secondary importance. The ENA cooling bias triggers the circumglobal teleconnection via the Northern Hemisphere annular mode, producing a strengthening of the Aleutian low, an enhancement of the southward Ekman and Oyashio cold advection, and thus a cooling SST in the North Pacific. In contrast, the TNA cooling produces a surface high extending to the eastern tropical North Pacific, inducing the northeasterly wind anomalies north, northerly cross-equatorial wind anomalies, and northwesterly wind anomalies south of the equator. This C-shape wind anomaly pattern generates an SST warming in the tropical southeastern Pacific, which eventually leads to an SST warming in the tropical central and western Pacific by the wind-evaporation-SST feedback. The tropical Pacific warming in turn leads to an SST cooling in the North Pacific by the Pacific North American teleconnection pattern.\n",

Insight into low-frequency (inter-decadal) changes in the SEB in response to climate warming and variable atmospheric circulation patterns has thus been limited. Here this problem is addressed by using ERA-Interim reanalysis data to extend glacier-meteorological records at two locations on Vestari Hagafellsj\u00f6kull (Iceland) for the period 1979\u20132012. Trend analysis is conducted for this series before the role of synoptic circulation in modulating surface energetics is investigated. The results indicate that potential melt energy has increased significantly throughout the period of simulation at both locations (by 19.7 and 32.4%), with the largest increase evident for the turbulent heat fluxes (36.3 and 93.1%). The synoptic conditions associated with the recent high melt rates on the proximate Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) do not result in similarly extreme melt conditions for our Icelandic location. We also find that the North Atlantic Oscillation Index is significantly correlated with the radiative and latent heat components of the SEB. This association remains hidden if the melt rate is assessed in isolation, highlighting the utility of the SEB approach presented here for assessing synoptic aspects of glacier-climate interactions.\n",

The Mann\u2013Kendall nonparametric test was used to detect significant historical trends in SAT and Spearman's correlation coefficient (\u03c1) to test the relationships between SAT patterns and various atmospheric circulation patterns over the northern hemisphere. The results showed that mean annual SAT in Finland increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) by 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009\u00b0C per decade during the study period and that the SAT was significantly (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.58, p\u2009<\u20090.05) positively correlated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. However, there were spatial differences within Finland for both the trends and relationships with the atmospheric circulation. Analysis of seasonal mean SAT identified significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) warming trends for both spring (by 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009\u00b0C per decade) and summer (by 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009\u00b0C per decade). Winter and spring mean SATs were most strongly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) correlated with the AO index (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.72 and 0.42, respectively), while the most significant teleconnection pattern for mean SAT in summer was the East Atlantic (EA) pattern (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.43, p\u2009<\u20090.05); and in autumn the EA/West Russia (WR) pattern (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.59, p\u2009<\u20090.05). These results provide a detailed spatial picture of climate warming in Finland in recent decades and reveal that interannual variation of the SAT in Finland is closely linked with a number of atmospheric circulation patterns, not just the AO and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Annual and cold-season SAT are mainly influenced by the AO and NAO, whereas the EA, EA/WR, Scandinavia (SCA) and West Pacific (WP) patterns play an important role for warm-season SAT.\n",
