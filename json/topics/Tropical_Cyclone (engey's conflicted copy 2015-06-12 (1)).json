        "description": "Strong tropical cyclones often undergo eyewall replacement cycles that is accompanied with concentric eyewalls and/or rapid intensity changes while the secondary eyewall contracts radially inward and eventually replaces the inner eyewall. To the best of our knowledge, the only documented partial/incomplete tertiary eyewall has been mostly inferred from two-dimensional satellite images or one-dimensional aircraft flight-level measurements that can be regarded as indirect and tangential. This study presents the first high spatial and temporal resolution Doppler radar observations of a tertiary eyewall formation event in Typhoon Usagi (2013) over a 14-hour time period before it makes landfall. The primary (tangential) and secondary (radial) circulations of Usagi deduced from the Ground-Based Velocity Track Display (GBVTD) methodology clearly portrayed three distinct axisymmetric maxima of radar reflectivity, tangential wind, vertical velocity, and vertical vorticity. Usagi\u2019s central pressure steadily deepened during the contraction of the secondary and tertiary eyewalls until the tertiary eyewall hit the coast of southeast China that terminated the intensification of Usagi.",

This paper provides the first comprehensive global review of tropical storm surge data sources, observations and impacts, while archiving data in SURGEDAT, a global database. Available literature has provided data for more than 700 surge events since 1880, the majority of which are found in the Western North Atlantic (WNA), followed by Australia/ Oceania, the Western North Pacific (WNP) and the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO). The Bay of Bengal (BOB) in the NIO consistently observes the world's highest surges, as this sub-basin averages five surges \u2265 5 m per decade, and has observed credible storm tide levels reaching 13.7 m. The WNP observes the highest rate of low-magnitude surges, as the coast of China averages 54 surges \u2265 1 m per decade, and rates are likely higher in the Philippines. The U.S. Gulf Coast observes the second highest frequency of both high (\u22655 m) and low (\u22651 m) magnitude surges. The BOB observes the most catastrophic surge impacts, as 59% of global tropical cyclones that have killed at least 5,000 people occurred in this basin. The six deadliest cyclones in this region have each killed at least 140,000 people, and two events have killed 300,000. Storm surge impacts transportation, agriculture and energy sectors in the WNA. Oceania experiences long-term impacts, including contamination of fresh water and loss of food supplies, although the highest surges in this region are lower than most other basins.\n",

The continuously increasing resolution of large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric models makes it feasible to treat the evolution of individual clouds. The explicit treatment of clouds requires the simulation of cloud microphysics. Two main approaches describing cloud microphysical properties and processes have been developed in the past four and a half decades: bulk microphysics parameterization and spectral (bin) microphysics (SBM). The development and utilization of both represent an important step forward in cloud modeling. This study presents a detailed survey of the physical basis and the applications of both bulk microphysics parameterization and SBM. The results obtained from simulations of a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, from tropical cyclones through Arctic clouds using these two approaches are compared. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as lines of future development for these methods are discussed.",

Observed California winter precipitation is highly correlated to a metric of extratropical cyclone activity over the Eastern Pacific. The lack of precipitation over the recent winters is coincident with consecutive winters of much below average cyclone activity. Analysis of variability in cyclone activity and California precipitation simulated by models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 indicates that most models can simulate the relationship between cyclone activity and precipitation well. Examination of projected change suggests 1) no evidence of a long-term downward trend in California-region cyclone activity within the examined scenarios; and 2) that the inter-model spread in California precipitation projection can be largely explained by the spread in the projection of extratropical cyclone activity. This highlights the need to further understand physical mechanisms for the variation in projection of cyclone activity in this region.",

However, a climatology of hurricane winds is lacking to date, largely because hurricanes are relatively rare events and difficult to observe over the open ocean. Here we present a new hurricane wind climatology based on objective surface wind analyses, which are derived from Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer measurements acquired by NOAA WP-3D and U.S. Air Force WC-130J hurricane hunter aircraft. The wind data were collected during 72 aircraft reconnaissance missions into 21 western Atlantic hurricanes from 1998\u20132012. This climatology provides an opportunity to validate hurricane intensity forecasts beyond the simplistic maximum wind speed metric and allows evaluating the predictive skill of probabilistic hurricane intensity forecasts using high-resolution model ensembles for the first time. An example of application is presented here using a 1.3 km grid-spacing Weather Research and Forecasting model ensemble forecast of Hurricane Earl (2010).",

One particular type of organization is the spatial self-aggregation of convection, taking the form of cloud clusters, or tropical cyclones in the presence of rotation. We show that several physical processes can give rise to self-aggregation, and highlight the key features responsible for it using idealized simulations. Longwave radiative feedbacks yield a \u201cradiative aggregation\" . In that case, sufficient spatial variability of radiative cooling rates yields a low-level circulation, which induces the up-gradient energy transport and radiative-convective instability. Not only do vertically-integrated radiative budgets matter, but the vertical profile of cooling is also crucial. Convective aggregation is facilitated when downdrafts below clouds are weak (\u201cmoisture-memory aggregation\" ), and this is sufficient to trigger aggregation in the absence of longwave radiative feedbacks. These results shed some light on the sensitivity of self-aggregation to various parameters, including resolution or domain size.",

The dynamical core, the central fluid flow component of any general circulation model (GCM), is often overlooked in the analysis of a model's ability to simulate TCs compared to the impact of more commonly documented components (e.g., physical parameterizations). The Community Atmosphere Model version 5 is configured with multiple dynamics packages. This analysis demonstrates that the dynamical core has a significant impact on storm intensity and frequency, even in the presence of similar large-scale environments. In particular, the spectral element core produces stronger TCs and more hurricanes than the finite-volume core using very similar parameterization packages despite the latter having a slightly more favorable TC environment. The results suggest that more detailed investigations into the impact of the GCM dynamical core on TC climatology are needed to fully understand these uncertainties.",

        "description": "\n\nGenerally, only clear-infrared spectral radiances (not affected by clouds) are assimilated in weather analysis systems. This is due to difficulties in modeling cloudy radiances as well as in observing their vertical structure from space. To take full advantage of the thermodynamic information in advanced infrared (IR) sounder observations requires assimilating radiances from cloud-contaminated regions. An optimal imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique has been developed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This technique can be used to retrieve clear column radiances through combining collocated multiband imager IR clear radiances and the sounder cloudy radiances; no background information is needed in this method. The imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique is similar to that of the microwave/IR cloud clearing in the derivation of the clear-sky equivalent radiances. However, it retains the original IR sounder resolution, which is critical for regional numerical weather prediction applications. In this study, we have investigated the assimilation of cloud-cleared IR sounder radiances using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for three hurricanes, Sandy (2012), Irene (2011), and Ike (2008). Results show that assimilating additional cloud-cleared AIRS radiances reduces the 48 and 72\u2009h temperature forecast root-mean-square error by 0.1\u20130.3\u2009K between 300 and 850\u2009hPa.

        "description": "\n\nSatellite microwave observations of rain, whether from radar or passive radiometers, depend in a very crucial way on the vertical distribution of the condensed water mass and on the types and sizes of the hydrometeors in the volume resolved by the instrument. This crucial dependence is nonlinear, with different types and orders of nonlinearity that are due to differences in the absorption/emission and scattering signatures at the different instrument frequencies. Because it is not monotone as a function of the underlying condensed water mass, the nonlinearity requires great care in its representation in the observation operator, as the inevitable uncertainties in the numerous precipitation variables are not directly convertible into an additive white uncertainty in the forward calculated observations. In particular, when attempting to assimilate such data into a cloud-permitting model, special care needs to be applied to describe and quantify the expected uncertainty in the observations operator in order not to turn the implicit white additive uncertainty on the input values into complicated biases in the calculated radiances. One approach would be to calculate the means and covariances of the nonlinearly calculated radiances given an a priori joint distribution for the input variables. This would be a very resource-intensive proposal if performed in real time. We propose a representation of the observation operator based on performing this moment calculation off line, with a dimensionality reduction step to allow for the effective calculation of the observation operator and the associated covariance in real time during the assimilation. The approach is applicable to other remotely sensed observations that depend nonlinearly on model variables, including wind vector fields. The approach has been successfully applied to the case of tropical cyclones, where the organization of the system helps in identifying the dimensionality-reducing variables.",

They play an important role for stratosphere-troposphere exchange, the dynamical coupling of upper and lower tropospheric levels, and for generating severe weather events. This study presents a global climatology of tropopause folds using ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1979 to 2012 and a refined version of a previously developed 3-D labeling and fold identification algorithm. This algorithm objectively separates stratospheric and tropospheric air in complex situations, e.g., in regions with strong low-level inversions, and in extratropical cyclones where diabatically generated potential vorticity anomalies typically occur. Three classes of tropopause folds are defined (shallow, medium, and deep), and their geographical distribution, vertical extent, and seasonal cycle are investigated. Most shallow folds occur along the subtropical jet stream, in agreement with previous studies. Hot spots of medium and deep tropopause folds are found west of Australia and along the coast of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere and around the east coast of North America in the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal cycles show maxima in winter for all fold classes. Medium and deep folds are frequently associated with surface wind gust and precipitation extremes, as quantified for folds over the southern Indian Ocean. Wind gust extremes occur mainly in an elongated band upstream and equatorward of folds, whereas precipitation extremes occur mainly east and poleward of folds. Overall, in the considered region, about 20% of medium folds and 33% of deep folds are associated with surface wind or precipitation extremes in the vicinity of the fold.",

A cross-correlation analysis is performed between the lightning and maximum sustained wind variations, giving lag and lead times related to the peak linear correlation for each tropical cyclone. A previous study of 58 cyclones by Price et al. (2009) is reexamined using the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship database for the maximum sustained wind speeds of each tropical cyclone showing a moderate to strong correlation between lightning and wind variations. An 8\u2009year data set of 144 tropical cyclones are analyzed in the same way, with a 10\u00b0 square window, giving similar results to the smaller data set. Using a radial lightning collection window of < 500\u2009km, we confirm the general results of previous studies that lightning can be used on a \u223c1\u2009day timescale to predict the evolution of the winds in tropical cyclones. Investigation of different lightning collection window sizes indicates that the lightning lead times are highly dependent upon the window size. Smaller collection windows have modal lightning lead times of \u223c2.75 and 0 days, indicating that the lightning location inside the cyclone is as important as the total lightning variation. We have also performed a fixed time lag correlation which shows that preexisting knowledge of what time lag to use is needed in order to use this approach as a predictive tool.",

        "description": "\n\nProper dynamic equation constraints in data assimilation (DA) systems can help improve balance of analyzed atmospheric state. The formulation of ensemble-variational DA algorithms allows for easy incorporation of such constraints, but their impacts within such DA systems have been little studied. A dynamic constraint based on the steady momentum equations is incorporated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) hybrid ensemble-three-dimensional variational (3DVar) (En3DVar) DA system as a weak constraint. The constraint aims at improving the coupling and balance among wind and thermodynamic state variables, especially when few state variables are directly observed. The scheme is applied to the assimilation of radar T-TREC (Typhoon-Tracking Radar Echo by Correlation) winds at a convection-allowing resolution, for landfalling typhoon, Chanthu (2010), when it was within the range of a coastal radar. Parallel experiments using the 3DVar and En3DVar with and without the dynamic constraint are run to examine the impact of the constraint. The flow-dependent ensemble covariance used in En3DVar helps to update unobserved pressure and temperature fields in a dynamically more consistent way compared to the static covariance; the added dynamic constraint produces more accurate pressure within the typhoon. The pressure field improved by the dynamic constraint also leads to better temperature and moisture analyses within the variational minimization through flow-dependent cross covariance. En3DVar analysis with the dynamic constraint produces the best intensity forecast for the typhoon, in terms of the minimum sea level pressure and maximum surface wind speed. Additional sensitivity experiments examine the impact of the weight of the dynamic constraint.",

Lightning in TCs over the northwest Pacific is more likely to occur in weak storms at tropical depression (10.8\u201317.1\u2009m\u2009s\u22121) and tropical storm (17.2\u201324.4\u2009m\u2009s\u22121) intensity levels, in agreement with past studies of Atlantic hurricanes. The greatest lightning density (LD) in the inner core appears in storms undergoing an intensity change of 15\u201325\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 during the next 24\u2009h. Lightning is observed in all storm intensity change categories: rapid intensification (RI), average intensity change (AIC), and rapid weakening (RW). The differences in LD between RI and RW are largest in the inner core, and the LD for RI cases is larger than for RW cases in the inner core (0\u2013100\u2009km). Lightning activity there, rather than in the outer rainbands, may be a better indicator for RI prediction in northwest Pacific storms. There was a marked increase in the lightning density of inner core during the RI stage for Super Typhoon Rammasun (2008). Satellite data for this storm show that the RI stage had the highest cloud top height and coldest cloud top temperatures, with all the minimum black body temperature values being below 200\u2009K in the inner core.",

        "description": "\n\nSuper typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, marking one of the strongest typhoons at landfall in recorded history. Extreme storm waves attacked the Pacific coast of Eastern Samar where the violent typhoon first made landfall. Our field survey confirmed storm overwash heights of 6\u201314 m above mean sea level were distributed along the southeastern coast and extensive inundation occurred in some coastal villages in spite of natural protection by wide fringing reefs. A wave model based on Boussinesq-type equations was constructed to simulate wave transformation over shallow fringing reefs and validated against existing laboratory data. Wave propagation and runup on the Eastern Samar coast are then reproduced using offshore boundary conditions based on a wave hindcast. The model results suggests that extreme waves on the shore are characterized as a superposition of the infragravity wave and sea-swell components. The balance of the two components is strongly affected by the reef width and beach slope through wave breaking, frictional dissipation, reef-flat resonances and resonant runup amplification. Therefore, flood characteristics significantly differ from site to site due to a large variation of the two topographic parameters on the hilly coast. Strong coupling of infragravity waves and sea swells produces extreme runup on steep beaches fronted by narrow reefs, whereas the infragravity waves become dominant over wide reefs and they evolve into bores on steep beaches.

        "description": "\n\nTemperature variations caused by a typhoon were measured in the northern part of Hiroshima Bay by four coastal acoustic tomography (CAT) systems. The horizontal distributions of depth-averaged temperature from 0 to 8 m were mapped at ten-minute intervals between the 11th and the 25th of September 2013. The horizontal distributions of a coastal upwelling and the associated diurnal internal tides were reconstructed well by regularized inversion based on the grid segmented method, using one-way travel time data along five successful sound transmission lines. Station-to-station ranges were corrected in such a way that sound speed (determined from one-way travel time data) was equal to sound speed calculated from a couple of CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) datasets on each transmission line. In addition, all station positions were adjusted to make focal points at the geographical positions of the transducers. The corrections increased the accuracy of temperature measurements to make temperature errors as small as 0.073-0.079 oC. The high accuracy made it possible to map the temperature structure with a variation range of less than 0.5 oC. An upwelling grew from 16 to 17 Sept., due to a typhoon-derived northerly wind. The diurnal internal tide resonated with the semi-diurnal external tide, which was pronounced after the upwelling decayed (18 Sept.), around the time the spring tide occurred. The upwelling and mixing fractions were formulated. These fractions increased continuously as the upwelling grew. Complete mixing was observed during the upwelling's mature phase.

        "description": "\n\nWe present a new methodology that allows quantifying the impact of individual terms of the temperature and salinity conservation within the mixed layer on mixed layer depth (MLD). The method is applied to output from an ocean general circulation model in the Indian Ocean to investigate variability and changes in MLD. On seasonal timescales and for most areas of the Indian Ocean variability of MLD is tightly linked to all thermohaline budget terms. In the Indian Ocean at approximately 20\u00b0S the MLD covaries with surface heat and freshwater fluxes on intraseasonal and interannual timescales. The geography of the region includes the Leeuwin Current, plus the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for interannual surface freshwater fluxes. The range of seasonal amplitudes of MLD variability varies with individual budget terms but is typically within 1 m/month to 100 m/month. The ocean footprints of an intraseasonal tropical cyclone, tropical and midlatitude seasonal temperature and salinity budgets and interannual variability associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode are analyzed. The results reveal close relationships of the thermohaline budgets within the mixed layer with the variability of the MLD. The associated tendencies of changes in MLD are consistent with Argo and satellite-based observations of tendencies within the mixed layer and sea-surface temperature and salinity.\n",

        "description": "\n\nBased on observed temperature and velocity in 2005 in northwestern South China Sea, the shallow ocean responses to three tropical cyclones were examined. The oceanic response to Washi was similar to common observations with 2\u00b0C cooling of the ocean surface and slight warming of the thermocline resulted from vertical entrainment. Moreover, the wavefield was dominated by first mode near-inertial oscillations, which were red-shifted and trapped by negative background vorticity leading to an e-folding timescale of 12 days. The repeated reflections by the surface and bottom boundaries were thought to yield the successive emergence of higher modes. The oceanic responses to Vicente appeared to be insignificant with cooling of the ocean surface by only 0.5\u00b0C and near-inertial currents no larger than 0.10 m/s as a result of a deepened surface mixed layer. However, the oceanic responses to Typhoon Damrey were drastic with cooling of 4.5\u00b0C near the surface and successive barotropic-like near-inertial oscillations. During the forced stage, the upper ocean heat content decreased conspicuously by 11.65% and the stratification was thoroughly destroyed by vertical mixing. In the relaxation stage, the water particle had vertical displacement of 20\u201330 m generated by inertial pumping. The current response to Damrey was weaker than Washi due to the deepened mixed layer and the destroyed stratification. Our results suggested that the shallow water oceanic responses to tropical cyclones varied significantly with the intensity of tropical cyclones, and was affected by local stratification and background vorticity.\n",

TC intensity shows local climate sensitivity particularly for upper ocean currents, salinity and mixed-layer depth, and 200\u2013850 mb wind shear. Remote influences from the Southern Oscillation, Saharan dust, and the South American monsoon are also identified as important. Ocean currents diminish along the coast of South America, so interbasin transfer between the North Brazil and Caribbean Currents declines in seasons of frequent and intense TCs. This is related to a dipole pattern in the sea surface height formed mainly by reduced trade wind upwelling northeast of Venezuela. A low-salinity plume from the Orinoco River spreads across the eastern Caribbean. It is the weaker currents and shallower mixed layer that conspire with surplus heat to build thermodynamic energy available for TC intensification.\n",

The approach is similar in concept to traditional parameterizations of CMT, but with the distinction that both the scalar transport and diagnostic pressure gradient force are calculated using information provided by the 2D CRM. No assumptions are therefore made concerning the role of convection-induced pressure gradient forces in producing up- or down-gradient CMT.\nThe proposed method is evaluated using a new superparameterized version of the Weather Research and Forecast model (SP-WRF) that is described herein for the first time. Results show that the net effect of the formulation is to modestly reduce the overall strength of the large-scale circulation, via \u201ccumulus friction\u201d. This statement holds true for idealized simulations of two types of mesoscale convective systems, a squall line and a tropical cyclone, in addition to real-world global simulations of seasonal (1 June \u2013 31 August) climate. In the case of the latter, inclusion of the formulation is found to improve the depiction of key synoptic modes of tropical wave variability, in addition to some aspects of the simulated time-mean climate. The choice of CRM orientation is also found to importantly affect the simulated time-mean climate, apparently due to changes in the explicit representation of wide-spread shallow convective regions.

        "description": "\n\nPrevious research quantified the sensitivity of limiting intensity to SST for observed tropical cyclones (TCs) and for TCs generated by two global climate models (GCMs). On average, a 1\u00b0 C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) is associated with a 7.9 m s\u22121 increase in the statistical upper limit of observed intensity. Conversely, a 1\u00b0C increase in SST does not significantly affect the limiting intensity of GCM-generated TCs. The study presented here builds on previous research in two ways: (1) A comparison is made between the statistically defined limiting intensity and the physically defined potential intensity, and (2) a test is performed on the ability of a \u223c0.94\u00b0 resolution GCM to reproduce the observed statistical relationship between potential intensity and SST. Data from NASA's Modern Era Reanalysis are used to approximate the observed sensitivity of potential intensity to SST for the 1982\u20132008 time period. Results indicate that the sensitivity of potential intensity to SST is not statistically different from the sensitivity of observed maximum or limiting intensity to SST. This result links the statistically defined sensitivity to the physically based theory of hurricanes. Potential intensity is also estimated from the FSU/COAPS GCM. Although the FSU/COAPS model does not capture the observed sensitivity of TC maximum or limiting intensity to SST, the model reproduces the observed sensitivity of potential intensity to SST. The model generates suitable atmospheric conditions for the development of strong TCs, however strong TCs do not develop, possibly as a result of insufficient resolution.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe purpose of this article is twofold. The first is to point out and correct several misconceptions about the putative WISHE mechanism of tropical cyclone intensification that currently are being taught to atmospheric science students, to tropical weather forecasters, and to laypeople who seek to understand how tropical cyclones intensify. The mechanism relates to the simplest problem of an initial cyclonic vortex in a quiescent environment. This first part is important because the credibility of tropical cyclone science depends inter alia on being able to articulate a clear and consistent picture of the hypothesized intensification process and its dependencies on key flow parameters. The credibility depends also on being able to test the hypothesized mechanisms using observations, numerical models, or theoretical analyses. The second purpose of the paper is to carry out new numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art numerical model to test a recent hypothesis invoking the WISHE feedback mechanism during the rapid intensification phase of a tropical cyclone. The results obtained herein, in conjunction with prior work, do not support this recent hypothesis and refute the view that the WISHE intensification mechanism is the essential mechanism of tropical cyclone intensification in the idealized problem that historically has been used to underpin the paradigm. This second objective is important because it presents a simple way of testing the hypothesized intensification mechanism and shows that the mechanism is neither essential nor the dominant mode of intensification for the prototype intensification problem. In view of the operational, societal, and scientific interest in the physics of tropical cyclone intensification, we believe this paper will be of broad interest to the atmospheric science community and the findings should be useful in both the classroom setting and frontier research.\n",

Eventually, TC simulations can be conducted at Large Eddy Simulation (LES) resolution, which requires \u0394x to fall in the inertial subrange (often <102 m) to adequately resolve the large, energy-containing eddies. Between the two lies the so-called \u201cterra incognita\u201d because some of the assumptions used by mesoscale models and LES to treat BL turbulence are invalid. This study performs several 4\u20136 h simulations of Hurricane Katrina (2005) without a BL parameterization at extremely fine \u0394x [333, 200, and 111 m, hereafter \u201cLarge Eddy Permitting (LEP) runs\u201d] and compares with mesoscale simulations with BL parameterizations (\u0394x\u2009=\u20093 km, 1 km, and 333 m, hereafter \u201cPBL runs\u201d). There are profound differences in the hurricane BL structure between the PBL and LEP runs: the former have a deeper inflow layer and secondary eyewall formation, whereas the latter have a shallow inflow layer without a secondary eyewall. Among the LEP runs, decreased \u0394x yields weaker subgrid-scale vertical momentum fluxes, but the sum of subgrid-scale and \u201cgrid-scale\u201d fluxes remain similar. There is also evidence that the size of the prevalent BL eddies depends upon \u0394x, suggesting that convergence to true LES has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the similarities in the storm-scale BL structure among the LEP runs indicate that the net effect of the BL on the rest of the hurricane may be somewhat independent of \u0394x.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe effects of vortex translation and radial vortex structure in the distribution of boundary layer winds in the inner core of mature tropical cyclones are examined using a high-resolution slab model and a multilevel model. It is shown that the structure and magnitude of the wind field (and the corresponding secondary circulation) depends sensitively on the radial gradient of the gradient wind field above the boundary layer. Furthermore, it is shown that vortex translation creates low wave number asymmetries in the wind field that rotate anticyclonically with height. A budget analysis of the steady state wind field for both models was also performed in this study. Although the agradient force drives the evolution of the boundary layer wind field for both models, it is shown that the manner in which the boundary layer flow responds to this force differs between the two model representations. In particular, the inner core boundary layer flow in the slab model is dominated by the effects of horizontal advection and horizontal diffusion, leading to the development of shock structures in the model. Conversely, the inner core boundary layer flow in the multilevel model is primarily influenced by the effects of vertical advection and vertical diffusion, which eliminates shock structures in this model. These results further indicate that special care is required to ensure that qualitative applications from slab models are not unduly affected by the neglect of vertical advection.\n",

Historical landfall counts in piecewise-linear segments approximating the coastline are modeled using Poisson regression with spatial random effects. Predictors include index representations of the mean hurricane-season phases of the Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation, with the effect of the latter also modeled spatially. This spatial generalized linear model for landfall frequency is used in conjunction with a data level accounting explicitly for the time-dependent uncertainty in the recorded landfall positions. The model performs skillfully in cross-validation exercises. The inferred effects of the climatic predictors are also consistent with current scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which related large-scale climatic variability affects the development and motion of Atlantic tropical cyclones. Sampling variability in the data over the short length of the observational record and observational error in the historical data are found to contribute substantially to the overall climatological uncertainty. The contribution from uncertainty in the underlying model parameters is negligible compared to these other sources. The model presented here could be used for applications in insurance and risk management, and adaptations could also be used to investigate changes in TC landfall climatology under an uncertain and changing climate.\n",

We first clarified the statistical features of the convection (structure, intensity, and environmental parameters) in various disturbances simulated by a global simulation with a sub-kilometre grid spacing. The convection in MJO (TC) was tall with a strong (weak) upward motion, and was driven by large convective available potential energy (strong low-level convergence).

        "description": "\n\nThe tropical cyclone (TC) secondary eyewall (SE) is an important aspect of TC intensity and structure forecast, because it largely affects the horizontal scale of destructive winds and heavy rainfall. Hence, it is important to understand the possible factors that influence the structure and size of SE. Idealized simulations suggest that the environmental humidity is one of the key factors. It is favorable for TC to establish a SE in a moist environment. Furthermore, the SE is likely to be located at a larger radius, thereby leads to a wider moat area. Consequently, the structure of SE would affect TC intensity change during the eyewall replacement cycle. This study strongly motivates further researches with respect to how the environmental conditions influence the storm dynamics and thermodynamics.\n",

Analyses focus on the period beginning with regular satellite monitoring of TCs (1969/1970) through the year 2012/2013 and consider daily and multi-daily annual maximum rainfall series. Our results indicate that TCs play a prominent role in extreme rainfall over much Australia, with more than half of the highest annual rainfall events associated with these storms over the coastal regions and in particular over Western Australia. Moreover, the TC fractional contribution to extreme rainfall increases as we focus on the largest rainfall events, with approximately 66\u2013100% of annual maxima in excess of 100\u2009mm (\u223c4\u2009inches) over Western Australia associated with TCs at over one third of the locations. Given the well-established controls on Australian TC activity by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we also examined the relationship between extreme rainfall associated with TCs and ENSO using logistic regression. A larger probability of having an annual rainfall maximum related to TCs occurs during La Ni\u00f1a years, consistent with enhanced Australian cyclogenesis during these phases of ENSO. We also highlighted regional differences in the link between ENSO and extreme rainfall events, highlighting the stronger connection along the coastal areas and in particular over Western Australia.\n",

All RCMs (RCA3.5, HadGEM3-RA, REMO, and RegCM4) were forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Model precipitation was compared against several observational gridded data sets at different time scales. Most RCMs capture well the annual cycle of precipitation and outperform ERA-Interim, which is drier than the observations. RCMs underestimate (overestimate) the precipitation over the coastal plains (mountains) and have some problems to reproduce the interannual variability of the monsoon. To further investigate this, two extreme summers that showed the largest consistency among observations and RCMs were chosen: one wet (1990) and one dry (2005). The impact of the passage of tropical cyclones, the size of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position, and the initial intensity of the land\u2013sea thermal contrast (LSTC) were analysed. During the wet year, the LSTC was stronger than the 2005 dry monsoon season and there were a larger number of hurricanes near the Gulf of California, the WHWP was more extended, and the ITCZ was located in a more northerly position than in 2005. All these processes contributed to a wetter NAM season. During the dry year, the LSTC was weaker, with a later onset, probably due to a previous very wet winter. The inverse precipitation relationship between winter and summer in the monsoon region was well captured by most of the RCMs. RegCM4 showed the largest biases and HadGEM3-RA the smallest ones.\n",

Data from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was used to identify warm fronts from 1979 to 2010. The identification method was based on the magnitude of meridional gradient of 850-hPa equivalent potential temperature (\u03b8e) and 850-hPa wind fields. Composites of the most important atmospheric variables were constructed from 1 day before until 1 day after the formation of the warm front. An average frequency of two warm fronts per month is observed, with higher frequencies in austral winter. Most warm fronts precede the formation of extratropical cyclones over Uruguay and form because of the southward movement of previous cold/stationary fronts. Warm fronts form on average around southern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and western part of southern Brazil and Uruguay, coupled to the eastern edge of the Chaco Low (CL) and the Northwestern Argentinean Low (NAL) where north/northwesterly flow predominates. An upper-level wave of wavenumber eight supports warm frontogenesis. Location and intensity of synoptic systems associated with a warm front event differ from winter to summer. Elevated instability is commonly present near warm fronts, and the average warm-front slope is 1\u2009:\u2009110, agreeing with other studies. Instability indices increase after the warm-front passage, leading to greater rainfall 1 day after the warm front forms.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe variability of intense tropical cyclone (TC) in the Southern Hemisphere and its relation to large-scale environmental parameters are examined through temporal and spatial principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that there was a shift from low intense TC activity during 1976/1977\u20131987/1988 (period 1) to high activity during 1988/1989\u20132007/2008 (period 2). Accumulated cyclone energy maps indicate that this shift is related to more occurrences of intense TCs in the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) and northwestern Australian region during period 2. The spatial-mode PCA identifies distinct sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) patterns dominating in periods 1 and 2. The four dominating patterns in period 1 have low or negative SSTA in the TC development regions (especially over SWIO), whereas the five dominating ones in period 2 have much higher SSTA in the same regions. The temporal variability of the vertical wind shear (VWS) over the Indian Ocean (IO) is examined through the temporal-mode PCA. The first mode is El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related, but there is no clear interdecadal variability identified. The second mode shows high VWS during the 1970s to early 1980s that is similar in length to period 1, followed by low VWS afterwards during period 2. This change in VWS thus may be responsible for the shift in intense TC activity over the IO. Linear correlative analysis shows that the mode of variability in VWS is significantly related to subtropical dipole events in the IO. Potential linkages of these findings with ENSO and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation are discussed.\n",

        "description": "\nDiabatic Rossby waves (DRWs) are a special type of low-level cyclones with a self-maintaining mechanism given an environment of moderate or strong baroclinicity and abundant moisture. Under certain conditions these shallow cyclones associated with a cyclonic low-level PV anomaly can serve as precursors for explosive cyclone intensification. The present study is the first to investigate DRWs in the Southern Hemisphere. Two typical DRW case studies are presented and a sophisticated algorithm is used to detect DRWs in operational analysis data from 2001 to 2012. DRWs occur in all ocean basins and seasons with a maximum in summer. On average, about 4 DRWs are found per month and 12% intensify explosively. Thereby, they contribute 6% to the total set of explosively deepening extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. DRW tracks originate slightly closer to the equator compared to normal extratropical cyclones, and they follow the convergence zones eastward and poleward. This results in a climatological DRW track density similar to a spiral, from the western South Pacific and ends in the eastern South Indian Ocean, broken only by the Andes. Eventually, typical synoptic situations associated with DRW genesis are identified. The categories include (i) low-level PV generation by upper-level induced lifting, (ii) a low-level jet-induced diabatic PV generation, and (iii) a transformation of the low-tropospheric PV anomaly from another system.\n",

Clustering was estimated by calculating the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of 30 December-February counts of Atlantic storm tracks passing nearby each grid point. Results from single historical simulations of 1975-2005 were compared to those from historical ERA40 reanalyses from 1958-2001 ERA40 and single future model projections of 2069-2099 under the RCP4.5 climate change scenario.\nModels were generally able to capture the broad features in reanalyses reported previously: underdispersion/regularity (i.e. variance less than mean) in the western core of the Atlantic storm track surrounded by overdispersion/clustering (i.e. variance greater than mean) to the north and south and over western Europe. Regression of counts onto North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices revealed that much of the overdispersion in the historical reanalyses and model simulations can be accounted for by NAO variability.\nFuture changes in dispersion were generally found to be small and not consistent across models. The overdispersion statistic, for any 30 year sample, is prone to large amounts of sampling uncertainty that obscures the climate change signal. For example, the projected increase in dispersion for storm counts near London in the CNRMCM5 model is 0.1 compared to a standard deviation of 0.25. Projected changes in the mean and variance of NAO are insufficient to create changes in overdispersion that are discernible above natural sampling variations.\n",

To test the \u03bb model, an idealized full-physics numerical model is employed to provide wind profile samples and also to show the influence of environmental temperature and properties of initial vortices on tropical cyclone size. It is found that the \u03bb model provides an accurate fit of azimuthal wind profile at the top of boundary layer. In the simulations, tropical cyclone size is sensitive to the sea surface temperature, upper tropospheric temperature and initial vortex structure. The numerical model confirms the assumed Gaussian distribution with width \u03bb of the moist entropy in the boundary layer. A linear relationship between model cyclone size and \u03bb is found in agreement with the \u03bb model. The \u03bb model predicts a weak relationship between tropical cyclone size and intensity as is observed. In addition, the \u03bb model suggests that the change in tropical cyclone size should be closely related to the angular momentum transport near the boundary layer as has been found in observations. The good agreement of the \u03bb model with the numerical model shows that the \u03bb model could be a reasonable alternative for characterizing the wind structure of tropical cyclones with only one scaling parameter.\n",

        "description": "\nThe most damaging winds in a severe extra-tropical cyclone often occur just ahead of the evaporating ends of cloud filaments emanating from the so-called cloud head. These winds are associated with low-level jets, sometimes occurring just above the boundary layer. The question then arises as to how the high momentum is transferred to the surface. An opportunity to address this question arose when the severe \u2018St Jude's Day\u2019 windstorm travelled across southern England on 28 October 2013. We have carried out a mesoanalysis of a network of 1-minute resolution automatic weather stations and high-resolution Doppler radar scans from the sensitive S-band Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar (CAMRa), along with satellite and radar network imagery and NWP products. We show that, although the damaging winds occurred in a relatively dry region of the cyclone, there was evidence within the LLJ of abundant precipitation residues from shallow convective clouds that were evaporating in a localised region of descent. We find that a pocket of high momentum was transported towards the surface by one of a few remaining actively precipitating convective clouds within the LLJ and also by precipitation free convection in the boundary layer that was able to entrain evaporatively cooled air from the LLJ. The boundary layer convection was organised in along-wind rolls separated by 500 m to about 3000 m, the spacing varying according to the vertical extent of the convection. Spacing was greatest where the strongest winds penetrated to the surface. A run with a medium-resolution version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was able to reproduce the properties of the observed LLJ. It confirmed the LLJ to be a sting jet which descended over the leading edge of a weaker cold-conveyor-belt jet.\n",

It is shown that this hurricane-scale model contains MPI as an asymptotically stable spiral point under the wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) feedback mechanism. Furthermore, the hurricane development is characterized by two different time-scales instead of a simple linear growth, as often assumed in previous studies. Inclusion of radiative cooling reduces the MPI limit, but the MPI equilibrium in general is structurally stable. In particular, radiative cooling will modify the basin of attraction of the MPI equilibrium and create a domain in the phase space of the hurricane scales such that a vortex would not develop if its initial condition falls within this domain. Potential mechanisms that can further unfold the stability of the MPI equilibrium will also be discussed.\n",

Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 24 h forecasts for 96 member ensembles provide the basis for analyses of hurricanes Bill (2009), Earl (2010), Igor (2010), Katia (2011) and Ophelia (2011). Ensemble sensitivity analysis is used to investigate which patterns in the analysis have a strong influence on the forecast intensity and then a novel sensitivity compositing technique is used to identify common patterns that affect the forecast intensity. We find a common response for increasing intensity associated with an initial increased primary and secondary circulation, an increased warm core, an elevated tropopause and moistening of the rain-band region. Perturbed initial-condition experiments show a linear response for modest initial amplitude and also signs of nonlinearity for large perturbations, indicating that these sensitivity patterns are robust for limited additional strengthening of the hurricane. When initial perturbations are partitioned into dry and moist variables, we find that most of the forecast change is achieved by the dry dynamics. Further investigation into convective indicators reveals that simulations in which only moist variables are perturbed experience less convective development in the eyewall throughout the forecast.\n",

Numerical simulations show that the model-generated dust plume modifies the thermal field, causing a clockwise turning of the vertical shear surrounding the plume, which changes the deep layer steering flow. The change in the steering flow modifies Helene's moving speed and direction as it transits the plume. As Helene exits the plume, it has a different trajectory than it would have had in the absence of dust-radiative forcing. Consequently, the difference in the tracks with and without dust-radiative forcing continues to grow with distance from the plume. The dust-induced changes in temperature and wind together cause Helene's modeled storm track to be in closer agreement with the observed track; the dust-radiative forcing reduces the error in the model's 7-day track forecasts by an average of 27% (\u223c205 km).\n",

        "description": "\nControl mechanisms of tropical cyclone size are investigated with the axisymmetric cloud model HURMOD. In agreement with preceding HURMOD studies, the model results exhibit the existence of a fixed-point attractor associated with a tropical cyclone. From the non-dimensionalized model equations, a similarity law is derived, which relates six model parameters to the horizontal extent of the tropical cyclone in a steady state. Each parameter is associated with one of the following processes: planetary rotation, condensation time-scale, radiative relaxation time-scale, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, and surface transfer. Individual variation of the parameters reveals that the radius of maximum horizontal wind speed is very sensitive to the Coriolis parameter, the mixing lengths and the radiative relaxation time-scale, whereas the radius of minimum tangential wind merely depends on the Coriolis parameter, the surface transfer coefficients, and the radiative relaxation time-scale. The increase of the radius of maximum horizontal wind speed with vertical eddy diffusivity goes along with an enhancement of the overturning mass flux within the secondary circulation. This agrees with the Hadley cell theory by Held and Hou who also emphasized the relevance of vertical diffusion. The strengthening of the overturning mass flux follows a power law similar to that found in an ocean modelling study. Moreover, TC size is found to be sensitive to environmental conditions comprising the prescribed sea-surface temperature, tropopause height and static stability, while the sensitivity with respect to relative humidity is relatively small in the model. When the torque due to the upper sponge layer is switched off, the model exactly fulfills in the long run the steady state angular momentum budget equation.\n",

        "description": "\nIn this study, we re-examine the hypothesis of the dissipative heating in the tropical cyclone (TC) maximum potential intensity (MPI) proposed by Bister and Emanuel in 1998. By analysing an integral energy equation for an atmospheric domain that encloses all the TC Carnot legs, it is shown that the dissipative heating within the boundary layer is inherently contained in the energy budget so that there is no need to treat it separately. Due to the well-mixed assumption, the net impact of the dissipative heating turns out to be negligible, resulting in the same MPI estimation as in Emanuel's 1986 article. Within the atmospheric surface layer, the dissipative heating comes at the expense of reduced internal kinetic energy in the boundary layer, which is not seen in Bister and Emanuel's formulation due to their assumption of constant wind speed within the atmospheric surface layer. Analysis of the energy distribution within the atmospheric surface layer shows that about 10\u201330% of the frictional work could be transferred to the ocean surface waves and oceanic well-mixed layer, and the assumption that all frictional work is converted to the dissipative heating therefore needs to be revisited. Given further uncertainties in how the dissipative heating is distributed within the surface layer and how the atmospheric surface layer exchanges heat with the ambient environment, we recommend use of the original MPI formula obtained by Emanuel (1986) in which the impact of the dissipative heating within the surface layer can be effectively included in the bulk enthalpy flux parametrization instead of considering dissipative heating as an independent heat source as proposed by Bister and Emanuel.\n",

        "description": "\nTo understand near-surface strong winds in extratropical cyclones, a simulation of a dry, idealised baroclinic wave is presented. The forces that accelerate the winds are analysed using the terms in the horizontal momentum equation. Two regions of strong near-surface winds developed within the simulation: one to the east of the low centre and the other to the southwest. The flow to the east, resembling the cold conveyor belt, accelerated as it passed through the strong pressure gradient associated with the warm-frontal zone. This acceleration was reduced by friction near the surface. The winds to the southwest were characterised by three airstreams. One airstream consisted of air parcels that started north of the warm front near the surface, accelerated north of the warm front, encircled the low and continued to accelerate to the southwest of the low. The increases in wind speed in this airstream (also part of the cold conveyor belt) resulted from the along-flow pressure gradient force being greater than friction. The second airstream consisted of air parcels that descended west of the cold front and maintained their speed during descent until they were slowed either by friction in the boundary layer, or as they moved southward against the local pressure gradient. Between these two airstreams, a third airstream was characterised by air parcels that accelerated during descent from the mid to lower troposphere whilst moving around the bent-back front. This airstream bears some resemblance to the sting jet and was accelerated by the pressure gradient force on descent until it encountered increased friction or moved against the local pressure gradient.\nWindstorm Tini (image produced by the Dundee Satellite Receiving Station) brought strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom on 12 February 2014 and is an example of an intense, extratropical cyclone. Storms like these often have strong winds in association with the distinctive cloud hook southwest of the low centre. In this article, the development of similar strong winds southwest of an idealized, extratropical cyclone are explored using the horizontal momentum equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "\nWarm conveyor belts (WCBs) are the main ascending air masses within extratropical cyclones. They often exhibit strong condensation and precipitation, associated with ascent on large scales or embedded convection. Most of the air outflows into the upper troposphere as part of a ridge. Such ridges are an integral part of Rossby waves propagating along the tropopause and are identified with a negative potential vorticity (PV) anomaly and associated anticyclonic circulation. It has been argued that diabatic modification of PV in WCBs has an important influence on the extent of the ridge, propagation of Rossby waves and weather impacts downstream.\nFollowing the coherent ensemble of trajectories defining a WCB, PV is expected to increase with time while below the level of maximum latent heating and then decrease as trajectories ascend above the heating maximum. In models, it is found that the net change is approximately zero, so that the average PV of the WCB outflow is almost equal to the PV of its inflow. Here, the conditions necessary for this evolution are explored analytically using constraints arising from the conservation of circulation. It is argued that the net PV change is insensitive to the details of diabatic processes and the PV maximum midway along a WCB depends primarily on the net diabatic transport of mass from the inflow to the outflow layer. The main effect of diabatic processes within a WCB is to raise the isentropic level of the outflow, rather than to modify PV.\n",

        "description": "\nA feature-based approach is introduced to assess the quality of the representation of warm conveyor belts (WCBs) in high-resolution forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). WCBs are moist ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones, which transport boundary-layer air within 1\u20132 days poleward to the upper troposphere. The WCB outflow is typically characterised by low potential vorticity (PV), amplifying upper-level ridges and in turn modifying the jet stream and downstream Rossby wave evolution. Therefore the correct representation of WCBs can be essential for medium-range weather prediction. A three-component verification measure PAL is introduced, measuring errors in the WCB outflow's PV anomaly (P component), the amplitude of the WCB (A component), and the location of the outflow (L component). The PAL approach is applied to North Atlantic WCBs in ECMWF forecasts during three winters between 2002/2003 and 2010/2011. For the latest winter, the PAL results are also compared to the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of upper-level PV. It is shown that (i) the representation of WCBs improves for forecasts with a shorter lead time, (ii) PAL values are on average better for more recent forecasts, (iii) recent model versions show no systematic over- or underestimation of WCB intensity, (iv) individual medium-range forecasts can be associated with large errors in particular in the amplitude of WCBs, and (v) the comparison of PAL and the ACC indicates that several poor forecasts in terms of ACC are indeed associated with significant errors in the representation of WCBs. Limitations of this study are also discussed.\n",

        "description": "\nThe ability of the High-Resolution Global Environmental Monitoring (HiGEM) climate model to represent high-impact, regional precipitation events is investigated in two ways. The first focuses on a case study of extreme regional accumulation of precipitation during the passage of a summer extratropical cyclone across southern England on 20 July 2007 that resulted in a national flooding emergency. The climate model is compared with a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model and higher-resolution, nested limited-area models. While the climate model does not simulate the timing and location of the cyclone and associated precipitation as accurately as the NWP simulations, the total accumulated precipitation in all models is similar to the rain-gauge estimate across England and Wales. The regional accumulation over the event is insensitive to horizontal resolution for grid spacings ranging from 90\u20134 km.\nSecondly, the free-running climate model reproduces the statistical distribution of daily precipitation accumulations observed in the England\u2013Wales precipitation record. The model distribution diverges increasingly from the record for longer accumulation periods, with a consistent under-representation of more intense multiday accumulations. This may indicate a lack of low-frequency variability associated with weather regime persistence. Despite this, the overall seasonal and annual precipitation totals from the model are still comparable to those from ERA-Interim.\n",

It is found that the TC warm core is highly sensitive to the shortwave radiative effect. For the nighttime storm, a tendency for a more intense warm core is found, with an elevated height compared to its daytime counterpart. As pointed out by previous studies, the radiative cooling during nighttime destabilizes the local and large-scale environment and thus promotes deep moist convection, which enhances the TC\u2019s intensity. Due to the different inertial stabilities, the diabatic heating in the eyewall will force different secondary circulations. For a strong TC with a deeper vertical structure, this promotes a thin upper-level inflow layer. This inflow carries the lower stratospheric air with high potential temperature and descends adiabatically in the eye, resulting in significant upper-level warming. The Sawyer\u2013Eliassen diagnosis further confirms that the height of the maximum temperature anomaly is likely attributable to the balance among the forced secondary circulations.</p>\n                  ",

This study re-examines TC formation by treating the MT as a large-scale background for TC activity during May\u2013October. Over an 11-year (2000\u201310) period, 8.3 TC formation events on average per year are identified to occur within MTs, accounting for 43.1% of the total TC formation events in the WNP basin. This percentage is much lower than those reported in previous studies. Further analysis indicates that TC formation events in monsoon gyres were included at least in some previous studies. The MT includes a monsoon confluence zone where westerlies meet easterlies and a monsoon shear line where the trade easterlies lie north of the monsoon westerlies. In this study, the large-scale flow pattern associated with TC formation in the MT is composited based on the reference point in the confluence zone where both the zonal and meridional wind components are zero with positive vorticity. While previous studies have found that many TCs form in the confluence zone, the composite analysis indicates that nearly all of the TCs formed in the shear region, since the shear region is associated with stronger low-level relative vorticity than the confluence zone. The prevailing easterly vertical shear of zonal wind and barotropic instability may also be conducive to TC formation in the shear region, through the development of synoptic-scale tropical disturbances in the MT that are necessary for TC formation.</p>\n                  ",

        "description": "The impact of parameter variations on the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System ensemble performance is examined, and subsets of ensemble members are used to identify the relative impact of the individual parameters. Two sets of parameter variations are considered. The first set has variations in the parametrization of cumulus convection only. The second set has variations in both convection and boundary layer parametrizations. In the tropics, parameter variations significantly increase ensemble spread in wind and temperature fields, and significantly reduce Brier scores for low-level wind speed and temperature, primarily through improvements to the resolution (the impact in the extratropics is negligible). There are also small but significant improvements in the ensemble mean tropical cyclone track forecasts. For the metrics considered here, the second set of parameter variations outperforms the first set. Examination of the spread within ensemble subsets suggests that the parameter with the biggest overall impact is one that helps to control the convective updraft parcel temperature deficit at cloud base level. Variations in the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant significantly increase ensemble spread in the low-level tropical winds near the date line, and in the low-level temperature field throughout the tropics and subtropics.",

Two periods representative of the end of the 20th and 21st centuries are investigated using the IPCC A1B scenario. The focus of the paper is on precipitation for the NH summer and winter seasons, however results from vorticity and winds are also presented. Similar number of events are identified at both resolutions. There are, however, a greater number of extreme precipitation events in the higher resolution run. The difference between maximum intensity distributions is shown to be statistically significant using a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. A generalized Pareto distribution is used to analyse changes in extreme precipitation and wind events. In both resolutions, there is an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events in a warmer climate for all seasons, together with a reduction in return period. This is not associated with any increased vertical velocity, or with any increase in wind intensity in the winter and spring. However, there is an increase in wind extremes in the summer and autumn associated with tropical cyclones migrating into the extratropics.",

        "description": "Conditional non-linear optimal perturbation (CNOP), which is a natural extension of the linear singular vector into the non-linear regime, has been suggested to identify data-sensitive regions in the adaptive observation strategy. CNOP is the global maximum of a cost function, whereas, local CNOP is the local maximum of the cost function if the local maximum exists. The potential application of CNOPs to tropical cyclone adaptive observation is researched. The CNOPs and the first singular vector (FSV) are numerically obtained by a spectral projected gradient algorithm with the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model. This paper examines two tropical cyclone cases, a fast straight moving typhoon Matsa (2005) and a slow moving recurving typhoon Shanshan (2006). The CNOPs and FSVs are obtained using the norms of background error at initial time and total dry energy at final time with a 36-h optimization time interval. The spatial structures of CNOPs, their energies, non-linear evolutions and impacts on track simulations are compared with those of the FSVs. The results show that both the CNOPs and the FSVs are localized, and evolve into the verification area at the final time with the upscale growth of perturbations. However, the CNOPs are different from the FSVs in spatial patterns, wind maximum distribution, growth rate of energy and impact on track simulation. Compared to FSV, CNOP and local CNOP have greater impact on the forecast in the verification region at the final time in terms of total energy, and have larger, at least similar impact on track simulation too. This indicates the CNOP method with constraint of the norm of background error at initial time and total energy norm at final time is a reasonable candidate in tropical cyclone adaptive observation. Therefore, both CNOP and local CNOP are suggested to be considered in tropical cyclone adaptive observation.",
