        "description": "\n\nInterannual variability of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and its influence on the extratropical teleconnection are analyzed. It is found that there is an interannual shift of the MJO activity between the Indian Ocean and the western-central Pacific. This is reflected by the year-to-year changes in the occurrence frequency of individual MJO phases. The leading mode of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of occurrence frequency of MJO phases shows an out-of-phase relationship between MJO phase 7 and phases 3\u20135. During winters when the MJO convection occurs more frequently in the Indian Ocean (phases 3\u20135), a winter-mean positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) tends to occur. These results indicate that the seasonal mean convection activity over the Indian Ocean related to the MJO is a possible driving forcing for the seasonal mean NAO variability in the boreal winter.",

Previous studies have linked wave heights to the north\u2013south atmospheric pressure anomalies in the North Atlantic, suggesting that thewave climate fluctuates as a response to changes in zonal circulation in the atmosphere. We identify changes in wave power in the North-East Atlantic that are strongly correlated to the dominant pressure anomalies, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and other modes. We present a reconstructed wave power climate for 1665\u20132005, using a combination of known and proxy indices for the NAO and other modes.

        "description": "\nThe transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to midlatitude dynamics. We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60\u00b0N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)\u2014anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68% of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60\u00b0N in winter and 56% in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams\u2014AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60\u00b0N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.",

        "description": "\n\nSiberian river water is a first-order contribution to the Arctic freshwater budget, with the Ob, Yenisey, and Lena supplying nearly half of the total surface freshwater flux. However, few details are known regarding where, when and how the freshwater transverses the vast Siberian shelf seas. This paper investigates the mechanism, variability and pathways of the fresh Kara Sea outflow through Vilkitsky Strait towards the Laptev Sea. We utilize a high-resolution ocean model and recent shipboard observations to characterize the freshwater-laden Vilkitsky Strait Current (VSC), and shed new light on the little-studied region between the Kara and Laptev Seas, characterized by harsh ice conditions, contrasting water masses, straits and a large submarine canyon. The VSC is 10-20 km wide, surface-intensified, and varies seasonally (maximum from August-March) and interannually. Average freshwater (volume) transport is 500\u2009\u00b1\u2009120 km3 a\u22121 (0.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 Sv), with a baroclinic flow contribution of 50-90%. Interannual transport variability is explained by a storage-release mechanism, where blocking-favorable summer winds hamper the outflow and cause accumulation of freshwater in the Kara Sea. The year following a blocking event is characterized by enhanced transports driven by a baroclinic flow along the coast that is set up by increased freshwater volumes. Eventually, the VSC merges with a slope current and provides a major pathway for Eurasian river water towards the Western Arctic along the Eurasian continental slope. Kara (and Laptev) Sea freshwater transport is not correlated with the Arctic Oscillation, but rather driven by regional summer pressure patterns. This article is protected by copyright.

        "description": "\n\nIn the western North Atlantic, warm and saline water is brought by the North Atlantic Current (NAC) from the subtropics into the subpolar gyre. Four inverted echo sounders with high precision pressure sensors (PIES) were moored between 47\u00b040\u2032N and 52\u00b030\u2032N to study the main pathways of the NAC from the western into the eastern basin. The array configuration that forms three segments (northern, central, and southern) allows partitioning of the NAC and some assessment of NAC flow paths through the different Mid-Atlantic Ridge fracture zones. We exploit the correlation between the NAC transport measured between 2006 and 2010 and the geostrophic velocity from altimeter data to extend the time series of NAC transports to the period from 1992 to 2013. The mean NAC transport over the entire 21 years is 27\u2009\u00b1\u20095 Sv, consisting of 60% warm water of subtropical origin and 40% subpolar water. We did not find a significant trend in the total transport time series, but individual segments had opposing trends, leading to a more focused NAC in the central subsection and decreasing transports in the southern and northern segments. The spectral analysis exhibits several significant peaks. The two most prominent are around 120 days, identified as the time scale of meanders and eddies, and at 4\u20139 years, most likely related to the NAO. Transport composites for the years of highest and lowest NAO indices showed a significantly higher transport (+2.9 Sv) during strong NAO years, mainly in the southern segment.\n",

        "description": "\n\nClimate variations influence North Atlantic winter storm intensity and resultant variations in wave energy levels. A 60 year hindcast allows investigation of the influence of decadal climate variability on long-term trends of North Atlantic wave power, PW, spanning the 1948\u20132008 epoch. PW variations over much of the eastern North Atlantic are strongly influenced by the fluctuating North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) atmospheric circulation pattern, consistent with previous studies of significant wave height, Hs. Wave activity in the western Atlantic also responds to fluctuations in Pacific climate modes, including the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern and the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation. The magnitude of upward long-term trends during winter over the northeast Atlantic is strongly influenced by heightened storm activity under the extreme positive phase of winter NAO in the early 1990s. In contrast, PW along the United States East Coast shows no increasing trend, with wave activity there most closely associated with the PNA. Strong wave power \u201cevents\u201d exhibit significant upward trends along the Atlantic coasts of Iceland and Europe during winter months. Importantly, in opposition to the long-term increase of PW, a recent general decrease in PW across the North Atlantic from 2000 to 2008 occurred. The 2000\u20132008 decrease was associated with a general shift of winter NAO to its negative phase, underscoring the control exerted by fluctuating North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on PW trends.\n",

The skill of the main teleconnection indices as predictors of seasonal streamflow in the IP was evaluated. The streamflow database used was composed of 382 stations, covering the period 1975\u20132008. Predictions were made using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach based on multiple linear regression, combining Variance Inflation Factor and Stepwise Backward selection to avoid multicollinearity and select the best subset of predictors. Predictions were made for four forecasting scenarios, from one to four seasons in advance. The correlation coefficient (RHO), Root Mean Square Error Skill Score (RMSESS), and the Gerrity Skill Score (GSS) were used to evaluate the forecasting skill. For autumn streamflow, good forecasting skill (RHO>0.5, RMSESS>20%, GSS>0.4) was found for a third of the stations located in the Mediterranean Andalusian Basin, the North Atlantic Oscillation of the previous winter being the main predictor. Also, fair forecasting skill (RHO>0.44, RMSESS>10%, GSS>0.2) was found in stations in the northwestern IP (16 of these located in the Douro and Tagus Basins) with two seasons in advance. For winter streamflow, fair forecasting skill was found for one season in advance in 168 stations, with the Snow Advance Index as the main predictor. Finally, forecasting was poorer for spring streamflow than for autumn and winter, since only 16 stations showed fair forecasting skill in with one season in advance, particularly in north-western of IP.\n",

        "description": "\n\nAlmost all of CMIP5 climate models show cold SST biases in the extratropical North Atlantic (ENA) and tropical North Atlantic (TNA) as well as in the North Pacific which are commonly linked with the weak simulated Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). A weak AMOC and its associated reduced northward oceanic heat transport are associated with a cooling of the ENA Ocean, whereas the TNA cooling is attributable to both weak AMOC and surface heat flux. The cold biases in the ENA and TNA have remote impacts on the SST bias in the North Pacific. Here we use coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments to show the mechanisms and pathways by which the ENA and TNA affect the North Pacific. The model simulations demonstrate that the cooling SST bias in the North Pacific is largely due to the remote effect of the cooling SST bias in the ENA, while the remote impact of the TNA cooling SST bias is of secondary importance. The ENA cooling bias triggers the circumglobal teleconnection via the Northern Hemisphere annular mode, producing a strengthening of the Aleutian low, an enhancement of the southward Ekman and Oyashio cold advection, and thus a cooling SST in the North Pacific. In contrast, the TNA cooling produces a surface high extending to the eastern tropical North Pacific, inducing the northeasterly wind anomalies north, northerly cross-equatorial wind anomalies, and northwesterly wind anomalies south of the equator. This C-shape wind anomaly pattern generates an SST warming in the tropical southeastern Pacific, which eventually leads to an SST warming in the tropical central and western Pacific by the wind-evaporation-SST feedback. The tropical Pacific warming in turn leads to an SST cooling in the North Pacific by the Pacific North American teleconnection pattern.\n",

        "description": "\n\nA spatially resolved climatology for the annual frequency of tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls along the Atlantic coast of North America is developed, and its uncertainty deriving from multiple sources is quantified. Historical landfall counts in piecewise-linear segments approximating the coastline are modeled using Poisson regression with spatial random effects. Predictors include index representations of the mean hurricane-season phases of the Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation, with the effect of the latter also modeled spatially. This spatial generalized linear model for landfall frequency is used in conjunction with a data level accounting explicitly for the time-dependent uncertainty in the recorded landfall positions. The model performs skillfully in cross-validation exercises. The inferred effects of the climatic predictors are also consistent with current scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which related large-scale climatic variability affects the development and motion of Atlantic tropical cyclones. Sampling variability in the data over the short length of the observational record and observational error in the historical data are found to contribute substantially to the overall climatological uncertainty. The contribution from uncertainty in the underlying model parameters is negligible compared to these other sources. The model presented here could be used for applications in insurance and risk management, and adaptations could also be used to investigate changes in TC landfall climatology under an uncertain and changing climate.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis work explores the impact of the development of global meridional and zonal SST gradients on the Mediterranean runoff variability during the Plio-Pleistocene transition, about 3 Ma. Results show that total annual mean Pliocene Mediterranean runoff is about 40% larger than during the pre-industrial period due to more increased extra-tropical specific humidity. As a consequence of a weakened and extended Hadley cell, the Pliocene northwest Africa hydrological network produces a discharge 30 timeslarger than today. Our results support the conclusion that during the Pliocene, the Mediterranean water deficit was reduced relative to today due to a larger river discharge. By means of a stand-alone atmospheric general circulation model, we simulate the separate impact of extra-tropical and equatorial SST cooling on the Mediterranean runoff. While cooling of equatorial SST does not imply significant changes to the Pliocene Mediterranean hydrological budget, the extra-tropical SST cooling increases the water deficit due to a decrease in precipitation and runoff. Consequently river discharge from this area reduces to pre-industrial levels. The main teleconnections acting upon the Mediterranean area today, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation during winter and the \u201cmonsoon-desert\u201d mechanism during summer already have a large influence on the climate of our Pliocene simulations. Finally, our results also suggest that in a climate state significantly warmer than today, changes of the Hadley circulation could potentially lead to increased water resources in northwest Africa.\n",

        "description": "\n\nOver the past 13 ka, the hydrology for the southeastern Mediterranean was mainly regulated by Nile River runoff, which in turn was controlled by climate forcing. Being affected by orbital forcing, and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), planktic foraminiferal data (assemblages, stable isotopes, and size properties) indicate three major periods. (1) From 13.0 to 11.5 ka, the upper water column was well-mixed, cold, and productive. (2) From 11.5 to 6.4 ka, hydrology and foraminifers were affected by intensified monsoonal circulation. The enhanced size of Globigerinoides ruber is interpreted as a response to environmental stress caused by low-saline waters. (3) After 6.4 ka, the southward retreat of the ITCZ caused a decrease in freshwater discharge and hence a return to ecological equilibrium. A drop in foraminifer diversity from 2.9 to 1.1 ka was related to more arid conditions, and limited supply of nutrients from the Nile River. We suggest a link to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) marking the Roman Humid Period in the western Mediterranean, and in anti-phase with the southeastern Mediterranean aridity. Because Nile River runoff exerted major control on surface hydrology, a connection to Indian and Pacific climate systems partially controlling precipitation over the Nile catchment area is hypothesized. From 1.1 to 0.54 ka, high foraminifer diversity indicates humid conditions synchronous to the Medieval Climate Anomaly under a positive NAO state. Over the past 0.54 ka encompassing the Little Ice Age, another arid period is indicated by a drop in foraminifer diversity.",

This study takes a new approach to this question by demonstrating clear physical differences between NAO variability on interannual-decadal (&lt;30 year) and multidecadal (&gt;30 year) timescales. It is shown that on the shorter timescale the NAO is dominated by variations in the latitude of the North Atlantic jet and storm track, whereas on the longer timescale it represents changes in their strength instead. NAO variability on the two timescales is associated with different dynamical behaviour in terms of eddy-mean flow interaction, Rossby wave breaking and blocking. The two timescales also exhibit different regional impacts on temperature and precipitation and different relationships to sea surface temperatures. These results are derived from linear regression analysis of the Twentieth Century and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses and of a high-resolution HiGEM General Circulation Model control simulation, with additional analysis of a long sea level pressure reconstruction. Evidence is presented for an influence of the ocean circulation on the longer timescale variability of the NAO, which is particularly clear in the model data. As well as providing new evidence of potential predictability, these findings are shown to have implications for the reconstruction and interpretation of long climate records.</p>\n                  ",

        "description": "\n\nIn this study, we investigate the influence of global climate oscillations on the local temperature and precipitation over the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is one of the driest regions in the world with very high temperatures and low precipitation. The identification and assessment of remote interactions (teleconnections) are carried out by using ground station and gridded data sets. Monthly rainfall data from six ground stations over the UAE for the period of 1982\u20132010 is used in this study along with the long-term gridded precipitation and temperature data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center and Global Historic Climatic Network. Linear correlations, wavelet analysis, and cross-wavelet analysis have been applied to identify the relation between climate indices and precipitation (temperature). The analysis reveals that the strong variability in precipitation is closely associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Indian Ocean Dipole Index (IOD) during the months of August\u2013March, September\u2013January, respectively. In case of temperature, the strong variability is associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) and the East Atlantic Oscillation Index (EAO) during the months of April\u2013October, July\u2013December. Spatial analysis of cross-wavelet reveals that the winter precipitation is significantly influenced by SOI and temperature during summer by the NAO. This research concludes that the negative phases of SOI (NAO) play a significant role in the increase of precipitation (decrease in summer temperatures) over the UAE region.\n",

        "description": "\n\nIt is of great importance to investigate links between hydrological drought and climate indices, which helps to further reveal the cause of hydrological drought from a perspective of climate change, thus helping guiding future drought prediction and control. For a case study in the Columbia River basin, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) was employed to characterize hydrological drought. The heuristic segmentation method was applied to identify change points of annual streamflow series spanning 1960\u20132012 in the Columbia River basin, and the cross-wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the correlations between monthly climate indices and SSI. The primary results are as following: (1) monthly SSI has a statistically significantly increasing trend in November and December and a noticeably decreasing trend in June and July in the main stream of the basin; (2) generally, hydrological drought risk in this basin is high, and that in the Snake River is higher than the main stream of the Columbia River; (3) El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) play a major role in affecting hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and ENSO index mainly affects SSI at a relatively short time scale (2\u20137\u2009years), while AO primarily impacts SSI at a relatively long time scale (more than 10 years); (4) anthropogenic activities intensify hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and they primarily influence the linkages between climate indices and hydrological drought at intra-annual scale (less than 12 months), however, which do not change the basic pattern of their correlations.\n",

It is found that the tropical Indo-Pacific SST helps to improve the prediction of EAM precipitation over oceanic regions and some localized areas over land, while the Indian Ocean alone does not show significant impact on prediction. The remote effects of NAO improve the prediction in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huaihe River valleys in boreal spring, fall and winter, and over oceanic areas in boreal summer and fall. The predictive skill of our model is not sensitive to the inclusion of the sensible heating and snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau, probably because their effects are implicitly present in the original EAM model.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe study of humidity is important for better understanding the past climatic variations. However, there have been few long-term humidity reconstructions using tree-ring widths worldwide. Here, we present a June\u2013September mean relative humidity (MRH69) reconstruction from AD 1837 to 2011 using Chinese pine trees (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) from the Yiwul\u00fc Mountain region in northeastern China. The reconstruction explained 39.8% of the instrumental variance during the calibration period. We found that precipitation only influenced the MRH69 on an annual scale (high frequency), but the mean maximum temperature (MMT) impacted the MRH69 both on an annual scale (high frequency) and decadal time scale (low frequency). The MRH69 reconstruction showed a consistently increasing trend from AD 1881 to 1990, after which it diminished sharply. More high humidity years occurred after the 1960s and more low humidity years occurred before the 1960s. In the study area, MRH69 decreased along with global warming after the 1980s. On the decadal scale, there were five high-value MRH69 intervals: 1842\u20131850, 1865\u20131871, 1898\u20131902, 1823\u20131927 and 1932\u20131997; there were five low-value intervals: 1851\u20131864, 1872\u20131897, 1903\u20131922, 1928\u20131931 and 1998\u20132006. In addition, the MRH69 reconstruction showed the large-scale representativeness of sea\u2013land coupling. On the decadal scale, our MRH69 reconstruction varied synchronously with the Arctic Oscillation index (AOI), suggesting that the AOI might be linked with MRH69 in the Yiwul\u00fc Mountain region. Historical documents and meteorological data indicate that flooding (or drought) often occurred in the years with higher (or lower) humidity compared with the moving average values of the mean relative humidity (MRH).\n",

        "description": "\n\nDrought is an extreme meteorological phenomenon involving serious economic consequences. In the Czech Lands, it is reflected in significant reductions in agricultural productivity, lack of water for hygiene and industry, and impacts of forest management. Mean monthly temperature and precipitation series created for the Czech Lands for 1805\u20132012 were used to calculate spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) drought indices (SPI-1, SPI-12, SPEI-1, SPEI-12, Z-index and PDSI), which were then used for further analyses. Fluctuations in drought indices demonstrate an increasing long-term dryness in the Czech climate, statistically significant for SPEI-12 and PDSI in MAM and JJA (in MAM as well for SPEI-1 and Z-index). A significant concentration of drought episodes before 1880 may be attributed to a lack of precipitation, whereas the droughts of recent decades (particularly 2004\u20132012) are more strongly related to high temperatures. The effects of droughts are reflected in significant reductions in winter wheat and spring barley yields in the eastern province of Moravia. Regression analysis of drought forcings discloses the importance of the North Atlantic Oscillation phase and the aggregate effect of anthropogenic forcing (driven largely by increases in CO2 concentration). Their magnitude of influence varies strongly with the type of drought index and season of the year. Other factors, such as solar irradiation and the Southern Oscillation phase make only minor contributions to drought variability. The effects of volcanic activity and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are even weaker and statistically insignificant.\n",

        "description": "\nThis study has investigated serial (temporal) clustering of extra-tropical cyclones simulated by 17 climate models that participated in CMIP5. Clustering was estimated by calculating the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of 30 December-February counts of Atlantic storm tracks passing nearby each grid point. Results from single historical simulations of 1975-2005 were compared to those from historical ERA40 reanalyses from 1958-2001 ERA40 and single future model projections of 2069-2099 under the RCP4.5 climate change scenario.\nModels were generally able to capture the broad features in reanalyses reported previously: underdispersion/regularity (i.e. variance less than mean) in the western core of the Atlantic storm track surrounded by overdispersion/clustering (i.e. variance greater than mean) to the north and south and over western Europe. Regression of counts onto North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices revealed that much of the overdispersion in the historical reanalyses and model simulations can be accounted for by NAO variability.\nFuture changes in dispersion were generally found to be small and not consistent across models. The overdispersion statistic, for any 30 year sample, is prone to large amounts of sampling uncertainty that obscures the climate change signal. For example, the projected increase in dispersion for storm counts near London in the CNRMCM5 model is 0.1 compared to a standard deviation of 0.25. Projected changes in the mean and variance of NAO are insufficient to create changes in overdispersion that are discernible above natural sampling variations.\n",

The use of long historical records for flood frequency analysis\nbrings in the question of flood stationarity, since climatic and land-use\nconditions can affect the relevance of past flooding as a predictor of\nfuture flooding. In this paper, a detailed 400 yr flood record from the\nTagus River in Aranjuez (central Spain) was analysed under stationary and\nnon-stationary flood frequency approaches, to assess their contribution\nwithin hazard studies. Historical flood records in Aranjuez were obtained\nfrom documents (Proceedings of the City Council, diaries, chronicles,\nmemoirs, etc.), epigraphic marks, and indirect historical sources and\nreports. The water levels associated with different floods (derived from\ndescriptions or epigraphic marks) were computed into discharge values using\na one-dimensional hydraulic model. Secular variations in flood magnitude and\nfrequency, found to respond to climate and environmental drivers, showed a\ngood correlation between high values of historical flood discharges and a\nnegative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Over the\nsystematic gauge record (1913\u20132008), an abrupt change on flood magnitude was\nproduced in 1957 due to constructions of three major reservoirs in the Tagus\nheadwaters (Bolarque, Entrepe\u00f1as and Buendia) controlling 80% of the\nwatershed surface draining to Aranjuez. Two different models were used for\nthe flood frequency analysis: (a) a stationary model estimating statistical\ndistributions incorporating imprecise and categorical data based on maximum\nlikelihood estimators, and (b) a time-varying model based on \"generalized\nadditive models for location, scale and shape\" (GAMLSS) modelling, which\nincorporates external covariates related to climate variability (NAO index)\nand catchment hydrology factors (in this paper a reservoir index; RI). Flood\nfrequency analysis using documentary data (plus gauged records) improved the\nestimates of the probabilities of rare floods (return intervals of 100 yr\nand higher). Under non-stationary modelling flood occurrence associated with\nan exceedance probability of 0.01 (i.e. return period of 100 yr) has changed\nover the last 500 yr due to decadal and multi-decadal variability of the\nNAO. Yet, frequency analysis under stationary models was successful in\nproviding an average discharge around which value flood quantiles estimated\nby non-stationary models fluctuate through time.",
