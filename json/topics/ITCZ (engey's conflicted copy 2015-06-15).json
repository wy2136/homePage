        "description": "\n\nGlobal Climate Models (GCMs) underestimate the observed trend in tropical expansion. Recent studies partly attribute it to black carbon aerosols (BC), which are poorly represented in GCMs. We conduct a suite of idealized experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4) coupled to a slab ocean model forced with increasing BC concentrations covering a large swath of the estimated range of current BC radiative forcing while maintaining their spatial distribution. The Northern Hemisphere (NH) tropics expand polewards nearly linearly as BC radiative forcing increases (0.70 W\u22121 m2), indicating that a realistic representation of BC could reduce GCM biases. We find support for the mechanism where BC induced midlatitude tropospheric heating shifts the maximum meridional tropospheric temperature gradient polewards resulting in tropical expansion. We also find that the NH poleward tropical edge is nearly linearly correlated with the location of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which shifts northwards in response to increasing BC.",

        "description": "\n\nThe Sahelian Sudan is an arid to semi-arid region that depends on the seasonal rainfall as the main source of water, but its rainfall has large interannual variability. Such dry regions usually have their main moisture sources elsewhere; thus the rainfall variability is directly related to the moisture transport. This study seeks to identify source regions of water vapor for Sahelian Sudan during the monsoon period, from July to September. We have used the Lagrangian trajectory model FLEXPART driven by ERA-interim results for the time period 1998 to 2008. The results show that most of the air masses that reach this region during the monsoon period have their major origins over the Arabian Peninsula, Central Africa or are associated with the tropical easterly jet. Flow associated with ITCZ contributes almost half of the total precipitated water; most of it comes from Central Africa. This suggests that moisture recycling is the major contributor, compared to Oceanic sources. The flows from the northeast (Arabian Peninsula and north Asia) and east (Horn of Africa and north Indian Ocean) contribute about one third of the precipitated water. The rest of precipitated water comes from the Mediterranean, subtropical Atlantic and western Sahel, all with smaller contribution. Our results also indicate that different sub-regions of Sahelian Sudan have different moisture sources. Such result needs to be taken into account in seasonal forecasting practices.",

The analysis is based on a combination of in situ SSS observations collected in the last three decades from voluntary observing ships, TAO/TRITON and PIRATA moorings, Argo floats and (few) CTD profiles. The mean latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific low SSS waters appear 1-3\u00b0 further poleward than the Evaporation minus Precipitation (E-P) minima linked to the Inter Tropical Convergence Zones (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). At the seasonal time scale, the E-P minima migrate poleward in summer hemispheres, leading the migration of the SSS minima by 2-3 months in the Atlantic ITCZ, Pacific SPCZ, and in the eastern part of the Pacific ITCZ. On the other hand, the seasonal displacements of E-P and SSS minima are in anti-phase in the central and western parts of the Pacific ITCZ. At the interannual time scale, the E-P and SSS minima migrate poleward during La Nina events in the Pacific and during the positive phase of the Atlantic Meridional Dipole (AMD) in the Atlantic (and vice versa during El Nino and the negative phase of the AMD). We further document long-term (1979-2009) meridional migrations of the E-P and SSS minima, especially in the SPCZ region, and discuss whether or not they are consistent with documented SST and wind stress trends.

        "description": "\n\nThe physical processes controlling the mixed layer salinity (MLS) seasonal budget in the tropical Atlantic ocean are investigated using a regional configuration of a ocean general circulation model. The analysis reveals that the MLS cycle is generally weak in comparison of individual physical processes entering in the budget, because of strong compensation. In evaporative regions, around the surface salinity maxima, the ocean acts to freshen the mixed layer against the action of evaporation. Poleward of the southern SSS maxima, the freshening is ensured by geostrophic advection, the vertical salinity diffusion and, during winter, a dominant contribution of the convective entrainment. On the equatorward flanks of the SSS maxima, Ekman transport mainly contributes to supply freshwater from ITCZ regions while vertical salinity diffusion adds on the effect of evaporation. All these terms are phase-locked through the effect of the wind. Under the seasonal march of the ITCZ and in coastal areas affected by river (7\u00b0S:15\u00b0N), the upper ocean freshening by precipitations and/or runoff is attenuated by vertical salinity diffusion. In the eastern equatorial regions seasonal cycle of wind forced surface currents advect freshwaters which are mixed with subsurface saline water because of the strong vertical turbulent diffusion. In all these regions, the vertical diffusion presents an important contribution to the MLS budget by providing, in general, an upwelling flux of salinity. It is generally due to vertical salinity gradient and mixing due to winds. Furthermore, in the equator where the vertical shear, associated to surface horizontal currents, is developed, the diffusion depends also on the sheared flow stability.

        "description": "\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a major source of the surface freshwater input to the tropical open ocean. Under the ITCZ, sea-surface salinity (SSS) fronts that extend zonally across the basins are observed by the Aquarius/SAC-D mission and Argo floats. This study examined the evolution and forcing mechanisms of the SSS fronts. It is found that, although the SSS fronts are sourced from the ITCZ-freshened surface waters, the formation, structure, and propagation of these fronts are governed by the trade wind driven Ekman processes. Three features characterize the governing role of Ekman forcing. First, the SSS fronts are associated with near-surface salinity-minimum zones (SMZs) of 50\u201380 m deep. The SMZs are formed during December\u2013March when the near-equatorial Ekman convergence zone concurs with an equatorward displaced ITCZ. Second, after the formation, the SMZs are carried poleward away at a speed of \u223c3.5 km d\u22121 by Ekman transport. The monotonic poleward propagation is a sharp contrast to the seasonal north/south oscillation of the ITCZ. Lastly, each SMZ lasts about 12\u201315 months until dissipated at latitudes beyond 10\u00b0N/S. The persistence of more than 1 calendar year allows two SMZs to coexist during the formation season (December\u2013March), with the newly formed SMZ located near the equator while the SMZ that is formed in the previous year located near the latitudes of 10\u201315\u00b0 poleward after 1 year's propagation. The contrast between the ITCZ and SMZ highlights the dominance of Ekman dynamics on the relationship between the SSS and the ocean water cycle.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis article explores how atmospheric radiative heating, due to the presence of clouds, influences the Madden-Julian-Oscillation (MJO) as simulated by four comprehensive atmosphere general circulation models. Simulations in which clouds are transparent to electromagnetic radiation (\"clouds-off'') are compared with control simulations in which clouds are allowed to interact with radiation (\"clouds-on\"). Making clouds transparent to radiation leads to robust changes of the mean state: the westerly winds in the equatorial Indo-Pacific area weakens and the precipitation reveals a shift from single to double Intertropical Convergence Zones. These changes are accompanied by weaker MJOs. Also the moisture sensitivity of precipitation changes, however not consistently within our group of models.\nFurther analyses show that within the active phase of intraseasonal variability, cloud radiative effects amplify the heating profiles compared to clouds-off. Heating from non-radiative processes is dominated by the parameterized convection, but large-scale heating associated with cloud microphysical processes acting on the grid-scale modifies the shape of the heating profile, leading to a top-heaviness when cloud radiative effects are accounted for. The radiative heating due to clouds slows down the phase speed of the MJO. Averaged over the entire MJO life-cycle, the column-integrated radiative heating due to clouds lags the vertically integrated moist static energy by 40\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 of longitude (equivalently 7 to 10 days assuming a period of 60 days).\nAll four models studied reveal more pronounced Kelvin waves when clouds are transparent to radiation, suggesting that cloud radiative effects on large-scale heating profiles damp smaller scale, or faster, Kelvin waves and amplify MJO-like disturbances.

        "description": "\n\nHigh-resolution sediment records from the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) spanning the last ~240\u2009ka B.P. were studied to document the nature of millennial-scale climatic events in the tropical Pacific and to investigate teleconnection mechanisms. We present organic carbon (%OC) and diffuse spectral reflectivity records as indicative of upwelling and productivity changes off NW Mexico over the middle to late Pleistocene. The new productivity records document the persistence of abrupt millennial-scale changes over the last two glacial cycles. Detailed spectral and wavelet time series analyses show the predominance of longer climatic cycles (2\u20136\u2009ka) during the last and the penultimate glacial periods. The persistence of millennial variability during the penultimate glacial, in absence of large ice rafted debris events in the North Atlantic, suggests that freshwater input through ice sheet dynamics is not essential for millennial-scale climate variability. Given the worldwide emerging picture of remarkable similar millennial-scale records over long time periods, we suggest that the pacing of this climate variability may represent a natural resonance in the climate system, amplified by a tightly coupled oceanic and atmospheric teleconnection processes. We present a schematic scenario of millennial-scale climate change depicting the role of the tropical Pacific in this global teleconnection system by linking productivity and upwelling changes in the ETNP with shifts in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the strength of the subtropical North Pacific High.",

        "description": "\n\nOver the past 13 ka, the hydrology for the southeastern Mediterranean was mainly regulated by Nile River runoff, which in turn was controlled by climate forcing. Being affected by orbital forcing, and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), planktic foraminiferal data (assemblages, stable isotopes, and size properties) indicate three major periods. (1) From 13.0 to 11.5 ka, the upper water column was well-mixed, cold, and productive. (2) From 11.5 to 6.4 ka, hydrology and foraminifers were affected by intensified monsoonal circulation. The enhanced size of Globigerinoides ruber is interpreted as a response to environmental stress caused by low-saline waters. (3) After 6.4 ka, the southward retreat of the ITCZ caused a decrease in freshwater discharge and hence a return to ecological equilibrium. A drop in foraminifer diversity from 2.9 to 1.1 ka was related to more arid conditions, and limited supply of nutrients from the Nile River. We suggest a link to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) marking the Roman Humid Period in the western Mediterranean, and in anti-phase with the southeastern Mediterranean aridity. Because Nile River runoff exerted major control on surface hydrology, a connection to Indian and Pacific climate systems partially controlling precipitation over the Nile catchment area is hypothesized. From 1.1 to 0.54 ka, high foraminifer diversity indicates humid conditions synchronous to the Medieval Climate Anomaly under a positive NAO state. Over the past 0.54 ka encompassing the Little Ice Age, another arid period is indicated by a drop in foraminifer diversity.",

All RCMs (RCA3.5, HadGEM3-RA, REMO, and RegCM4) were forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Model precipitation was compared against several observational gridded data sets at different time scales. Most RCMs capture well the annual cycle of precipitation and outperform ERA-Interim, which is drier than the observations. RCMs underestimate (overestimate) the precipitation over the coastal plains (mountains) and have some problems to reproduce the interannual variability of the monsoon. To further investigate this, two extreme summers that showed the largest consistency among observations and RCMs were chosen: one wet (1990) and one dry (2005). The impact of the passage of tropical cyclones, the size of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position, and the initial intensity of the land\u2013sea thermal contrast (LSTC) were analysed. During the wet year, the LSTC was stronger than the 2005 dry monsoon season and there were a larger number of hurricanes near the Gulf of California, the WHWP was more extended, and the ITCZ was located in a more northerly position than in 2005. All these processes contributed to a wetter NAM season. During the dry year, the LSTC was weaker, with a later onset, probably due to a previous very wet winter. The inverse precipitation relationship between winter and summer in the monsoon region was well captured by most of the RCMs. RegCM4 showed the largest biases and HadGEM3-RA the smallest ones.\n",

        "description": "\nThe internal processes within an African Easterly Wave (AEW) system, involving mass, dynamic and water vapour fields are investigated using ERA-I reanalysis, in order to highlight the interactions between convection and AEWs. The budgets of heat, moisture and momentum are analysed during the different phases of AEWs detected using synoptic-scale precipitable water anomalies as proposed by Poan et al. (2013). The strong climatological meridional gradient of moisture present in the Sahel impacts the shape of the apparent heat source and humidity sink. AEW events over the Sahel are associated with a meridional shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Large exchanges of momentum by small-scale convective transport are also highlighted between the low- and mid-levels, contributing to the reinforcement of the AEW circulation at 600 hPa and the damping of the monsoon flow. This also appears as a possible mechanism for the vertical tilt of the meridional wind associated with AEWs. Heat budget computation, in the southern flank of the West African Heat-Low (HL) region where such AEWs occur, reveals that the heating anomalies are mainly driven by the horizontal advections. The vertical circulation acts as a precursor, which initiates the heat transport in the lower troposphere. However, weaker, turbulent mixing also participates in the development of these anomalies, especially in the boundary layer. These budgets ultimately allow the distinct contributions of diabatic and adiabatic processes to be determined.\n",

Limpasuvan<br /><br />It remains challenging to quantify global cloud properties and uncertainties\nassociated with their impacts on climate change because of our poor\nunderstanding of cloud three-dimensional (3-D) structures from observations and unrealistic characterization of\n3-D cloud effects in global climate models (GCMs). In this study we find\ncloud 3-D effects can cause significant error in cloud ice and radiation\nmeasurements if it is not taken into account appropriately.\n<br><br>\nOne of the cloud 3-D complexities, the slantwise tilt structure, has not\nreceived much attention in research and even less has been reported\nconsidering a global perspective. A novel approach is presented here to\nanalyze the ice cloud water content (IWC) profiles retrieved from CloudSat\nand a joint radar\u2013lidar product (DARDAR). By integrating IWC\nprofiles along different tilt\nangles, we find that upper-troposphere (UT) ice cloud mass between 11 and\n17 km is tilted poleward from active convection centers in the tropics\n[30\u00b0 S, 30\u00b0 N]. This systematic tilt in cloud mass\nstructure is expected from the mass conservation principle of the Hadley\ncirculation with the divergent flow of each individual convection/convective\nsystem from down below, and its existence is further confirmed from\ncloud-resolving-scale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model\nsimulations. Thus, additive effects of tilted cloud structures can introduce\n5\u201320% variability by its nature or produce errors to satellite\ncloud/hydrometeor ice retrievals if simply converting it from slant to nadir\ncolumn. A surprising finding is the equatorward tilt in middle tropospheric\n(5\u201311 km) ice clouds, which is also evident in high-resolution model\nsimulations but not in coarse-resolution simulations with cumulus\nparameterization. The observed cloud tilt structures are intrinsic properties\nof tropical clouds, producing synoptic distributions around the Intertropical\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ). These findings imply that current interpretations\nbased on over-simplified cloud vertical structures could lead to considerable\ncloud measurement errors and have a subsequent impact on understanding cloud\nradiative, dynamical and hydrological properties.",

Therefore,\naccurate reconstructions of past vegetation and hydrological changes are\ncrucial for a better understanding of climate variability in the tropical\nsoutheastern African region. We present high-resolution pollen records from\na marine sediment core recovered offshore of the Rufiji River delta. Our data\ndocument significant shifts in pollen assemblages during the last\ndeglaciation, identifying, through changes in both upland and\nlowland vegetation, specific responses of plant communities to atmospheric\n(precipitation) and coastal (coastal dynamics and sea-level changes)\nalterations. Specifically, arid conditions reflected by a maximum pollen\nrepresentation of dry and open vegetation occurred during the Northern\nHemisphere cold Heinrich event 1 (H1), suggesting that the expansion of drier\nupland vegetation was synchronous with cold Northern Hemisphere\nconditions. This arid period is followed by an interval in which forest and\nhumid woodlands expanded, indicating a hydrologic shift towards more humid\nconditions. Droughts during H1 and the shift to humid conditions around 14.8 kyr BP in the uplands are consistent with latitudinal shifts of the\nintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude Northern\nHemisphere climatic fluctuations. Additionally, our results show that the\nlowland vegetation, consisting of well-developed salt marshes and mangroves\nin a successional pattern typical for vegetation occurring in intertidal\nhabitats, has responded mainly to local coastal dynamics related to marine\ninundation frequencies and soil salinity in the Rufiji Delta as well as to the\nlocal moisture availability. Lowland vegetation shows a substantial\nexpansion of mangrove trees after ~ 14.8 kyr BP, suggesting an\nincreased moisture availability and river runoff in the coastal area.
