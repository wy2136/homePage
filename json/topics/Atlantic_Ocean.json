Seasonal distribution of mineral dust around the globe and its correlation with atmospheric circulation is investigated using satellite data, and meteorological data from ECMWF. The most important sources of dust are located in North Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia with an observed summer maximum, and East Asia with a spring peak. Maximum dust activity over North Africa and the Middle East in summer is attributed to dry convection associated with the summertime low-pressure system, while unstable weather and dry conditions are responsible for the spring peak in dust emission in East Asia. Intercontinental transport of mineral dust by atmospheric circulation has been observed, including trans-Atlantic transport of North African dust, trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust, and transport of dust from the Middle East across the Indian Ocean. The extent of African dust over the Atlantic Ocean and its latitudinal variation with season is related to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, including seasonal changes in the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and variation of wind patterns. North African aerosols extend over longer distances across the North Atlantic in summer because of greater dust emission, an intensified easterly low level jet (LLJ) and strengthening of the Azores-Bermuda anticyclonic circulation. Transport of East Asian aerosol is facilitated by the existence of a LLJ that extends from East Asia to the west coast of North America.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Northward migrations of the equatorial currents in the Atlantic Ocean have little influence on the Gulf Stream. Nevertheless, southward migrations, especially abrupt large southward migrations of the equatorial currents, can lead to the increase of the Brazil Current and the significant decrease of the North Brazil Current, in turn the weakening of the Gulf Stream. The results from the model simulations suggest the mean position of the equatorial currents in the Atlantic Ocean shifted at least 180\u2013260<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km southwards of its present-day position during the Little Ice Age based on the calculations of simple linear equations and the OGCM simulations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana.

Pollen analysis from two marine sediment cores (NGHP-01-16A and NGHP-01-19B) collected from the offshore Godavari and Mahanadi basins, both located in the Core Monsoon Zone (CMZ) reveals changes in Indian summer monsoon variability and intensity during three contrasting climatic periods: the Holocene, the Heinrich Stadial (HS) 2 and the Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5/4 during the ice sheet growth transition. During the first part of the Holocene between 11,300 and 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP, characterized by high insolation (minimum precession, maximum obliquity), the maximum extension of the coastal forest and mangrove reflects high monsoon rainfall. This climatic regime contrasts with that of the second phase of the Holocene, from 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP to the present, marked by the development of drier vegetation in a context of low insolation (maximum precession, minimum obliquity). The historical period in India is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak monsoon centennial phases that may reflect the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. During the HS 2, a period of low insolation and extensive iceberg discharge in the North Atlantic Ocean, vegetation was dominated by grassland and dry flora indicating pronounced aridity as the result of a weak Indian summer monsoon. The MIS 5/4 glaciation, also associated with low insolation but moderate freshwater fluxes, was characterized by a weaker reduction of the Indian summer monsoon and a decrease of seasonal contrast as recorded by the expansion of dry vegetation and the development of <italic>Artemisia</italic>, respectively. Our results support model predictions suggesting that insolation changes control the long term trend of the Indian monsoon precipitation, but its millennial scale variability and intensity are instead modulated by atmospheric teleconnections to remote phenomena in the North Atlantic, Eurasia or the Indian Ocean.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Overall, we find non-linear responses of Atlantic deep-water circulation to a cooling climate, with differently evolving glacial and interglacial states. Our main conclusion is that peak North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) production was reached between \u223c2.0 and 1.5\u00a0Ma, most prominently seen by a maximum in ventilated (high \u03b4<sup loc=\"post\">13</sup>C) conditions in the mid-depth Southeast Atlantic (Site 1264). We infer that a major source of NADW at this time was the export of dense overflow water from the Nordic Seas into the abyssal East Atlantic. Sea surface temperature records from the North and South Atlantic support this notion and indicate that the peak NADW production between \u223c2.0 and 1.5\u00a0Ma was compensated by a stronger warm surface-water return flow (i.e. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was enhanced), causing long-term (&amp;gt;10<sup loc=\"post\">5</sup> year) heat piracy from the South to the North Atlantic. In the wider picture of Plio-Pleistocene climate evolution, we find that a long-term enhancement in the average state of AMOC (\u223c2.4\u20131.3\u00a0Ma) coincides with the \u201c41-kyr world\u201d. Hence, we speculate that the transitory negative feedback response of enhanced AMOC to a cooling climate supplied heat to key areas of ice-sheet growth, acting to limit their size and maintain the \u201c41-kyr world\u201d. Once a threshold in global cooling was reached, the strength of AMOC lessened, providing a positive feedback for the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition and the associated build-up of northern hemisphere ice-sheets.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

This study aims to perform a diagnostic analysis of the observed climate conditions during this event, including an inspection of the occurred precipitation anomalies in the context of previous years, and an investigation of possible relationships with sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns. The sea surface temperature analysis revealed that the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean region near the coast of southeast Brazil showed strong negative association with precipitation over southeast Brazil, indicating that increased sea temperatures in this ocean region are consistent with reduced precipitation as observed in summer 2014. The circulation analysis revealed prevailing anti-cyclonic anomalies at lower levels (850\u00a0hPa) with northerly anomalies to the west of southeast Brazil, channeling moisture from the Amazon towards Paraguay, northern Argentina and southern Brazil, and drier than normal air from the South Atlantic Ocean towards the southeast region of Brazil. This circulation pattern was found to be part of a large-scale teleconnection wave train linked with the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific, which in turn was generated by an anomalous tropical heat source in north/northeastern Australia. A regional Hadley circulation with an ascending branch to the south of the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific was identified as an important component connecting the tropical and extratropical circulation. The ascending branch of this Hadley circulation in the south Pacific coincided with an identified Rossby wave source region, which contributed to establishing the extratropical component of the large-scale wave train connecting the south Pacific and the Atlantic region surrounding southeast Brazil. This connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic was confirmed with Rossby ray tracing analyses. The local circulation response was associated to downward air motion (subsidence) over Southeast Brazil, contributing to the expressive negative precipitation anomalies observed during summer 2014, and leading to a major drought event in the historical context. The analysis of atmospheric and oceanic patterns of this event helped defining a schematic framework leading to the observed drought conditions in southeast Brazil, including the involved teleconnections, blocking high pressure, radiative and humidity transport effects.</p>\n                ",

Congestus clouds act to moisten the tropical atmosphere, may be mixed-phase, and on occasion surpass the freezing level inversion from where they may develop into deeper convection. This study investigates the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the growth of congestus clouds produced in idealized cloud-resolving model simulations run under a state of radiative convective equilibrium (RCE). High resolution, long duration simulations were completed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Aerosol concentrations between 2 and 4\u2009km AGL were varied from clean to polluted conditions in order to represent the advection of Saharan dust over the Atlantic Ocean. The congestus populations within each aerosol simulation are statistically analyzed using ten days of model output after the simulation reaches RCE. Results indicate that congestus in more polluted conditions produce greater amounts of cloud water and ice mass, enhanced updraft strengths and an increase in the number of congestus cloud tops that extend above the freezing level. Enhanced vapor depositional growth on the populations of more numerous, smaller cloud droplets in the polluted conditions, and the subsequent increase in latent heat release in the warm phase regions of the cloud, are found to be important factors in convective invigoration of these cloud systems. Aerosol feedbacks associated with cold pools and condensate loading also influence the updraft strength, and act in opposition to the warm phase invigoration processes.\n",

While \u03b418Ocalcite appears synchronous with Dansgaard-Oeschger Interstadials (DOIs) throughout the record, millennial scale variability in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and reconstructed \u03b418Oseawater are frequently out of phase with Greenland climate. Changes in water mass characteristics such as \u03b418Ocalcite and enriched \u03b415N events apparently responded to millennial-scale climate change during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), such that negative \u03b418Ocalcite excursions coincided with heavier \u03b415N. These water mass characteristic shifts are suggestive of the presence of surface water advected from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) by relative strengthening of the California Undercurrent (CUC) bringing warm, salty tropical waters poleward. The linkage between the strength of the CUC on the NE Pacific margin and millennial-scale climate change may be related to increased sea surface heights off Central America as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifted northward in response to changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation. Poor correlations between proxies exist through late MIS 3 into MIS 2. Ice sheet growth could have disrupted the linkage between CUC and the NE Pacific margin as the Laurentide Ice sheet disrupted atmospheric circulation and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet increasingly influenced regional paleoceanography.\n",

The relationship between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and southern Amazon fires (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.003) was stronger than links between SSTs and either cyclones or fires alone, suggesting that fires and tropical cyclones were directly coupled to the same underlying atmospheric dynamics governing tropical moisture redistribution. These relationships help explain why seasonal outlook forecasts for hurricanes and Amazon fires both failed in 2013 and may enable the design of improved early warning systems for drought and fire in Amazon forests.\n",

Correction for\npotential isotopic offsets from equilibrium or the expected value is\nparamount, as too is the ability to define a comparable life stage for each\nspecies that allows for direct comparison. Past research has focused upon\nfinding a specific size range for individual species in lieu of other\nidentifiable features, thus allowing ocean parameters from a particular constant\n(i.e. a specific depth or season) to be reconstructed. Single-shell isotope\nanalysis of fossil shells from a mid-latitude North Atlantic Ocean\npiston core covering Termination III (200 to 250 ka) highlight the\nadvantage of using a dynamic size range, i.e. utilising measurements from\nmultiple narrow sieve size fractions spanning a large range of total body\nsizes, in studies of palaeoclimate. Using this methodology, we show that\nisotopic offsets between specimens in successive size fractions of\n<i>Globorotalia inflata</i> and <i>Globorotalia truncatulinoides</i> are\nnot constant over time, contrary to previous findings. For \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O in\nsmaller-sized globorotalids (212\u2013250 \u03bcm) it is suggested that the\noffset from other size fractions may reflect a shallower habitat in an early\nontogenetic stage. A reduction in the difference between small and large\nspecimens of <i>G. inflata</i> between insolation minima and maxima is\ninterpreted to relate to a prolonged period of reduced water column\nstratification. For the shallow-dwelling species <i>Globigerina\nbulloides</i>, no size\u2013isotope difference between size fractions is observed, and\nthe variability in the oxygen isotopic values is shown to correlate well\nwith the seasonal insolation patterns. As such, patterns in oxygen isotope\nvariability of fossil populations may be used to reconstruct past seasonality\nchanges.",

The deep-sea sedimentary record can provide valuable insight on the marine ecosystem response to this protracted global warming event and consequently on the ecological changes during this time. Here we present new benthic foraminiferal assemblage data from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1051 in the subtropical North Atlantic, spanning the MECO and post-MECO interval (41.1 to 39.5\u2009Ma). We find little change in the species composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages during the studied interval, suggesting that the rate of environmental change was gradual enough that these organisms were able to adapt. However, we identify two transient intervals associated with peak warming (higher-productivity interval (HPI)-1; 40.07\u201339.96\u2009Ma) and shortly after the MECO (HPI-2; 39.68\u201339.55\u2009Ma), where benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates increase by an order of magnitude. These HPIs at Site 1051 appear to coincide with intervals of strengthened productivity in the Tethys, Southern Ocean, and South Atlantic, and we suggest that an intensified hydrological cycle during the climatic warmth of the MECO was responsible for eutrophication of marine shelf and slope environments.\n",

Here we experimentally investigate links between biological activity in seawater and sea spray aerosol (SSA) flux, a relationship of potential significance for organic aerosol loading and cloud formation over the oceans, and thus for climate globally. Bubbles were generated in laboratory mesocosm experiments either by recirculating impinging water jets or glass frits. Experiments were conducted with Atlantic Ocean seawater collected off the eastern end of Long Island, NY, and with artificial seawater containing cultures of bacteria and phytoplankton Thalassiosira pseudonana, Emiliania huxleyi, and Nannochloris atomus. Changes in SSA size distributions occurred during all phases of bacterial and phytoplankton growth, as characterized by cell concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total particulate carbon (TPC), and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP, gel-forming polysaccharides representing a major component of biogenic exudate material). Over a 2 week growth period, SSA particle concentrations increased by a factor of less than 2 when only bacteria were present and by a factor of about 3 when bacteria and phytoplankton were present. Production of jet generated SSA particles of diameter less than 200 nm increased with time, while production of all particle diameters increased with time when frits were used. The implications of a marine biological activity dependent SSA flux are discussed.\n",

Here, we reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1087 in the Southeast Atlantic to investigate surface ocean circulation patterns during the late Pleistocene (0\u2013500 ka). The UK\u201937 index and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are used to reconstruct SSTs, \u03b4Dalkenone is used to reconstruct changes in sea-surface salinity, and mass accumulation rates of alkenones and chlorin pigments are quantified to detect changing marine export productivity.\nThe greatest amplitude of SST warming precedes decreases in benthic \u03b418O and therefore occurs early in the transition from glacials to interglacials. \u03b4Dalkenone, as a salinity indicator, increases before SSTs, suggesting that the pattern of Agulhas leakage is more complex than suggested by SST proxies. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 10 shows an anomalous pattern: it is marked by a pronounced increase in chlorin concentration, which may be related to enhanced/expanded Benguela upwelling reaching the core site. We find no evidence of an absence of Agulhas leakage throughout the record, suggesting there is no Agulhas cut-off even during MIS 10. Finally, the ODP site 1087 record shows an increasing strength of Agulhas leakage towards the present day, which may have impacted the intensity of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). As a result, the new analyses from ODP Site 1087 demonstrate a complex interaction between influences of the Benguela Upwelling and the Agulhas Leakage through the late Pleistocene, which are inferred here to reflect changing circulation patterns in the Southern Ocean and in the atmosphere.\n",

Pastor, J. A. Valiente, and M. J. Estrela<br /><br />Heavy rain events are frequently recorded in the Western Mediterranean\ncausing economic losses and even human casualties. The Western Mediterranean\nis a deep and almost closed sea surrounded by high mountain ranges and with\nlittle exchange of water with the Atlantic ocean. A main factor in the\ndevelopment of torrential rains is ocean-atmosphere exchanges of heat and\nmoisture that can potentially destabilize air masses travelling over the sea.\nThe study of air mass trajectories previous to the rain event permits the\nidentification of sea areas that could probably contribute to the development\nor intensification of rainfall. From a previous Mediterranean sea surface\ntemperature climatology, its spatio-temporal distribution patterns have been\nstudied showing two main distribution modes in winter and summer and\ntransitional regimes in spring and autumn. Hence, three heavy precipitation\nevents, for such winter and summer sea temperature regimes and for fall\ntransition, affecting the Valencia region have been selected to study the\neffect of sea surface temperature in torrential rains. Simulations with\nperturbed sea surface temperature in different areas along the air mass path\nwere run to compare results with unperturbed simulation. The variation of sea\nsurface temperature in certain areas caused significant changes in model\naccumulated values and its spatial distribution. Therefore, the existence of\nareas that at a greater extent favour air-sea interaction leading to the\ndevelopment of torrential rainfall in the Valencia region has been shown. This\nmethodology could be extended to the whole Mediterranean basin to look for\nsuch potential recharge areas. The identification of sea areas that\ncontribute to the development or intensification of heavy rain events in the\nMediterranean countries could be a useful prognosis and/or monitoring tool.",

Follows<br /><br />We present a numerical model of the ocean that couples a three-stream\nradiative transfer component with a marine biogeochemical\u2013ecosystem component in\na dynamic three-dimensional physical framework. The radiative transfer\ncomponent resolves the penetration of spectral irradiance as it is absorbed and\nscattered within the water column.  We explicitly include the effect of several\noptically important water constituents (different phytoplankton functional\ntypes; detrital particles; and coloured dissolved organic matter, CDOM). The\nmodel is evaluated against in situ-observed and satellite-derived products. In\nparticular we compare to concurrently measured biogeochemical, ecosystem, and\noptical data along a meridional transect of the Atlantic Ocean. The simulation\ncaptures the patterns and magnitudes of these data, and estimates surface\nupwelling irradiance analogous to that observed by ocean colour satellite\ninstruments.\nWe find that incorporating the different optically important\nconstituents explicitly and including spectral irradiance was crucial to\ncapture the variability in the depth of the  subsurface  chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>) maximum.\nWe conduct a series of sensitivity experiments to\n      demonstrate, globally, the relative importance of each of the water\n      constituents, as well as the crucial feedbacks between the light field,\n      the relative fitness of phytoplankton types, and the biogeochemistry\n      of the ocean.\n CDOM has proportionally more importance at attenuating light at\nshort wavelengths and in more productive waters, phytoplankton absorption is\nrelatively more important at the subsurface Chl <i>a</i>\nmaximum, and  water molecules have the greatest contribution\nwhen concentrations of other constituents are low, such as in the\noligotrophic gyres. Scattering had less effect on attenuation,\nbut since it is important for the amount and type of upwelling irradiance, it is\ncrucial for setting sea surface reflectance.\n   Strikingly, sensitivity experiments in which\n      absorption by any of the optical constituents was increased led to\n      a decrease in the size of the oligotrophic regions of the subtropical\n      gyres: lateral nutrient supplies were enhanced as a result of\n      decreasing high-latitude productivity.\nThis new model that\n      captures bio-optical feedbacks will be important for improving our\n      understanding of the role of light and optical constituents on ocean\n      biogeochemistry, especially in a changing environment.\n      Further, resolving surface upwelling irradiance will make it easier to\n      connect to satellite-derived products in the\n      future.",

The modes considered are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian (EA/WR) pattern and the Scandinavian (SCAN) pattern. The wave dataset consists of buoys records, remote sensing altimetry observations and a numerical hindcast providing significant wave height (SWH), mean wave period (MWP) and mean wave direction (MWD) for the period 1989\u20132009. After evaluating the reliability of the hindcast, we focus on the impact of each mode on seasonal wave parameters and on the relative importance of wind-sea and swell components. Results demonstrate that the NAO and EA patterns are the most relevant, whereas EA/WR and SCAN patterns have a weaker impact on the North Atlantic wave climate variability. During their positive phases, both NAO and EA patterns are related to winter SWH at a rate that reaches 1\u2009m per unit index along the Scottish coast (NAO) and Iberian coast (EA) patterns. In terms of winter MWD, the two modes induce a counterclockwise shift of up to 65\u00b0 per negative NAO (positive EA) unit over west European coasts. They also increase the winter MWP in the North Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (up to 1\u2009s per unit NAO) and along the western coasts of Europe and North Africa (1\u2009s per unit EA). The impact of winter EA pattern on all wave parameters is mostly caused through the swell wave component.\n",

We use a global ocean-atmosphere model of Hg (GEOS-Chem) to simulate these observed trends and determine the driving environmental variables. The atmospheric decline at northern midlatitudes can largely be explained by decreasing North Atlantic oceanic evasion. The midlatitude atmospheric signal propagates to the Arctic but is countered by rapid Arctic warming and declining sea ice, which suppresses deposition and promotes oceanic evasion over the Arctic Ocean. The resulting simulation implies a decline of Hg in the Arctic surface ocean that we estimate to be \u22120.67%\u2009yr\u22121 over the study period.

Most of the infragravity wave energy is trapped or dissipated near coastlines, but a small percentage escapes into the open oceans. The source of deep ocean infragravity waves is debated, specifically whether they come mostly from regions with strong source waves or from sites with particular morphologies/orientations. We correlate measurements of infragravity waves in the deep North Atlantic Ocean with infragravity wave generation parameters throughout the Atlantic Ocean to find the dominant sources of deep ocean infragravity wave energy in the North Atlantic Ocean. The deep ocean infragravity wave data are from a 5 year deployment of absolute pressure gauges west of the Azores islands (37\u00b0N, 35\u00b0W) and shorter data sets from seafloor tsunami gauges (DART buoys). Two main sources are identified: one off of the west coast of southern Europe and northern Africa (25\u00b0N\u201340\u00b0N) in northern hemisphere winter and the other off the west coast of equatorial Africa (the Gulf of Guinea) in southern hemisphere winter. These regions have relatively weak source waves and weak infragravity wave propagation paths to the main measurement site, indicating that that the site morphology/orientation dominates the creation of deep ocean infragravity waves. Both regions have also been identified as potential sources of global seismological noise, suggesting that the same mechanisms may be behind the generation of deep ocean infragravity waves and global seismological noise in the frequency band from 0.001 to 0.04 Hz.\n",

The ensemble is diagnosed and validated by comparison between the ensemble spread and the model/observation difference, as well as by rank histogram before the assimilation experiments. An incremental analysis update scheme is applied in order to reduce spurious oscillations due to the model state correction.

For deterministic validation, the ensemble means, together with the ensemble spreads are compared to the observations, in order to diagnose the ensemble distribution properties in a deterministic way. For probabilistic validation, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is used to evaluate the ensemble forecast system according to reliability and resolution. The reliability is further decomposed into bias and dispersion by the reduced centered random variable (RCRV) score in order to investigate the reliability properties of the ensemble forecast system. The improvement of the assimilation is demonstrated using these validation metrics. Finally, the deterministic validation and the probabilistic validation are analyzed jointly.

Using spatially and temporally collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System data sets, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave aerosol direct shortwave radiative effects (ARE) of absorbing aerosols above low-level water clouds in the southeast Atlantic Ocean was examined in this study. The regional averaged instantaneous ARE has been estimated to be 36.7\u2009\u00b1\u200920.5\u2009Wm\u22122 (regional mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) along with a mean positive OMI Aerosol Index at 1.3 in August 2006 based on multisensors measurements. The highest magnitude of instantaneous ARE can even reach 138.2\u2009Wm\u22122. We assess that the 660\u2009nm cloud optical depth (COD) values of 8\u201312 is the critical value above (below) which aerosol absorption (scattering) effect dominates and further produces positive (negative) ARE values. The results further show that ARE values are more sensitive to aerosols above lower COD values than cases for higher COD values. This is among the first studies to provide quantitative estimates of shortwave ARE due to AAC events from an observational perspective.",

The causal factors of this extinction are poorly constrained, at least partially because the ecology of Discoaster is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between the extinction and environmental changes by comparing a suite of high-resolution nannofossil assemblage data at four Ocean Drilling Program sites to published environmental proxy records. Through the use of multivariate analysis, we determine Discoaster shared environmental preferences with the extant species Florisphaera profunda which thrives in the lower photic zone near the nutricline in locations where the water column is stratified. We show that the last occurrence of Discoaster was globally diachronous, rather than synchronous as previously thought, and likely took place in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. We propose that the demise of Discoaster was a two-stage process. A decrease in sea surface temperatures and increase in climate variability led to a global decline in Discoaster abundance. The extinction event itself correlates to shoaling of the nutricline as signified by a decrease in the carbon isotopic gradient between surface and thermocline foraminifera. We hypothesize that the combination of global cooling and a shoaling of the nutricline greatly reduced Discoaster's deepwater niche and contributed to its extinction. This may suggest that ocean stratification and the depth of the nutricline are important contributors to overall nannoplankton diversity.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe detrimental impacts of climate variability on water, agriculture, and food resources in East Africa underscore the importance of reliable seasonal climate predictions. This study compares several forecasting methods using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to predict East African rains with various lead times. It is shown that the forecasts can explain more than 50% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The forecasts also explain more than 50% of the long rains (boreal spring) over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40% of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010\u20132011 forecasts for both the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.\n",

        "description": "\n\nExtratropical cyclone (ETC) tracks across eastern Canada are examined by applying a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to the lower-tropospheric relative vorticity field of reanalysis data. Both the seasonal cycle and the interannual variability of ETCs are quantified in terms of overall cyclone frequency, intensity, and regions of development and decay. We find that ETCs travelling to eastern Canada tend to develop over the Rockies, the Great Lakes and the US East Coast. The ETCs are most intense over Newfoundland and the North Atlantic Ocean, confirming previous findings. While ETCs at cities along the Atlantic coastline (e.g. St. John's) are dominated by East Coast cyclones (which are intense in winter), those inland (e.g. Toronto) track primarily from the Great Lakes. ETCs that develop over the Gulf of Mexico affect eastern Canada infrequently, but those that do tend to be intense. The interannual variability of the wintertime ETCs is influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Significant ENSO-related variability is found over most regions of southern Canada, except on the east coast. Although ETCs at Toronto are significantly modulated by ENSO, no visible changes are found at St. John's. These ENSO-related ETC changes are mostly due to the shifts in ETC development regions, with minor changes in the travelling direction of ETCs.\n",
