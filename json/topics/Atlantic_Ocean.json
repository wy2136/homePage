Nine &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m oscillations in water level were documented between ca. 15 and 4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka. The earliest lake level oscillation between ca. 14.5 and 13<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka is not well constrained with water level to at least 70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the present surface and subsequently fell to at least 50<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m. Lake level increased to at least 90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, post Younger Dryas cooling. Water level fell by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>30<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m by 10.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka, with another potential rise at ca. 8.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka to &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above current level. Lake level regressed by &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m at 8.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka coincident with cooling in the equatorial eastern Atlantic Ocean. Two major &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>70<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m lake level oscillations centered at 6.6 and 5.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka may reflect enhanced convection with warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. The termination of the African Humid Period occurred from ca. 8.0 to 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and is characterized by highly variable lake level (\u00b1&amp;gt;40<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m), rather than one monotonic fall in water level. This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana. Also, for this closed lake basin excesses and deficits in water input are amplified with a cascading lake effect in the East African Rift Valley and through the Chew Bahir Basin. The final regression from a high stand of &amp;gt;<hsp sp=\"0.10\"/>90<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m above the present lake began at 5.2<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka and water level was below 20<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>m by 4.5<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>ka; and for the remainder of the Holocene. This sustained low stand is associated with weakening of the West African Monsoon, a shift of the mean position of Congo Air Boundary west of the Lake Turkana catchment and with meter-scale variability in lake level linked to Walker circulation across the Indian Ocean.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br> <h3 class=\"h3\">Graphical abstract</h3> <img src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921818115001265-fx1.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"390\" alt=\"image\"/></br></br><br></br></br>",

Seasonal distribution of mineral dust around the globe and its correlation with atmospheric circulation is investigated using satellite data, and meteorological data from ECMWF. The most important sources of dust are located in North Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia with an observed summer maximum, and East Asia with a spring peak. Maximum dust activity over North Africa and the Middle East in summer is attributed to dry convection associated with the summertime low-pressure system, while unstable weather and dry conditions are responsible for the spring peak in dust emission in East Asia. Intercontinental transport of mineral dust by atmospheric circulation has been observed, including trans-Atlantic transport of North African dust, trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust, and transport of dust from the Middle East across the Indian Ocean. The extent of African dust over the Atlantic Ocean and its latitudinal variation with season is related to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, including seasonal changes in the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and variation of wind patterns. North African aerosols extend over longer distances across the North Atlantic in summer because of greater dust emission, an intensified easterly low level jet (LLJ) and strengthening of the Azores-Bermuda anticyclonic circulation. Transport of East Asian aerosol is facilitated by the existence of a LLJ that extends from East Asia to the west coast of North America.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, the causations of the Gulf Stream weakening due to the southward migration of the ITCZ remain uncertain. Here we use satellite observation data and employ a model (oceanic general circulation model \u2013 OGCM) to demonstrate that the Brazilian promontory in the east coast of South America may have played a crucial role in allocating the equatorial currents, while the mean position of the equatorial currents migrates between northern and southern hemisphere in the Atlantic Ocean. Northward migrations of the equatorial currents in the Atlantic Ocean have little influence on the Gulf Stream. Nevertheless, southward migrations, especially abrupt large southward migrations of the equatorial currents, can lead to the increase of the Brazil Current and the significant decrease of the North Brazil Current, in turn the weakening of the Gulf Stream. The results from the model simulations suggest the mean position of the equatorial currents in the Atlantic Ocean shifted at least 180\u2013260<hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>km southwards of its present-day position during the Little Ice Age based on the calculations of simple linear equations and the OGCM simulations.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

However, this notion has been challenged on the basis that the instrumental record is too short and unreliable to reveal long-term trends in hurricane activity. This study addresses this limitation by investigating hurricane-induced overwash deposits (paleotempestites) behind a barrier island in Naples, FL, USA. Paleotempestologic proxies including grain size, percent calcium carbonate, and fossil shells species were used to distinguish overwash events in two sediment cores spanning the last one thousand years. Two prominent paleotempestites were observed in the top 20\u00a0cm of both cores: the first identified as Hurricane Donna in 1960 whereas an older paleotempestite (1900\u20131930) could represent one of three documented storms in the early 1900s. An active period of hurricane overwash from 1000 to 500\u00a0yrs. BP and an inactive period from 500 to 150\u00a0yrs. BP correlate with reconstructed SSTs from the Main Development Region (MDR) of the North Atlantic Ocean. We observe an increased number of paleotempestites when MDR SSTs are warmer, coinciding with the Medieval Warm Period, and very few paleotempestites when MDR SSTs are cooler, coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Results from this initial Southwest Florida study indicate that MDR SSTs have been a key long-term climate driver of intense Southwest Florida hurricane strikes.</simple-para> </abstract-sec><br></br></br><br></br></br>",

Pollen analysis from two marine sediment cores (NGHP-01-16A and NGHP-01-19B) collected from the offshore Godavari and Mahanadi basins, both located in the Core Monsoon Zone (CMZ) reveals changes in Indian summer monsoon variability and intensity during three contrasting climatic periods: the Holocene, the Heinrich Stadial (HS) 2 and the Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5/4 during the ice sheet growth transition. During the first part of the Holocene between 11,300 and 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP, characterized by high insolation (minimum precession, maximum obliquity), the maximum extension of the coastal forest and mangrove reflects high monsoon rainfall. This climatic regime contrasts with that of the second phase of the Holocene, from 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP to the present, marked by the development of drier vegetation in a context of low insolation (maximum precession, minimum obliquity). The historical period in India is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak monsoon centennial phases that may reflect the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. During the HS 2, a period of low insolation and extensive iceberg discharge in the North Atlantic Ocean, vegetation was dominated by grassland and dry flora indicating pronounced aridity as the result of a weak Indian summer monsoon. The MIS 5/4 glaciation, also associated with low insolation but moderate freshwater fluxes, was characterized by a weaker reduction of the Indian summer monsoon and a decrease of seasonal contrast as recorded by the expansion of dry vegetation and the development of <italic>Artemisia</italic>, respectively.

Congestus clouds act to moisten the tropical atmosphere, may be mixed-phase, and on occasion surpass the freezing level inversion from where they may develop into deeper convection. This study investigates the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the growth of congestus clouds produced in idealized cloud-resolving model simulations run under a state of radiative convective equilibrium (RCE). High resolution, long duration simulations were completed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Aerosol concentrations between 2 and 4\u2009km AGL were varied from clean to polluted conditions in order to represent the advection of Saharan dust over the Atlantic Ocean. The congestus populations within each aerosol simulation are statistically analyzed using ten days of model output after the simulation reaches RCE. Results indicate that congestus in more polluted conditions produce greater amounts of cloud water and ice mass, enhanced updraft strengths and an increase in the number of congestus cloud tops that extend above the freezing level. Enhanced vapor depositional growth on the populations of more numerous, smaller cloud droplets in the polluted conditions, and the subsequent increase in latent heat release in the warm phase regions of the cloud, are found to be important factors in convective invigoration of these cloud systems. Aerosol feedbacks associated with cold pools and condensate loading also influence the updraft strength, and act in opposition to the warm phase invigoration processes.\n",

These water mass characteristic shifts are suggestive of the presence of surface water advected from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) by relative strengthening of the California Undercurrent (CUC) bringing warm, salty tropical waters poleward. The linkage between the strength of the CUC on the NE Pacific margin and millennial-scale climate change may be related to increased sea surface heights off Central America as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifted northward in response to changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation. Poor correlations between proxies exist through late MIS 3 into MIS 2. Ice sheet growth could have disrupted the linkage between CUC and the NE Pacific margin as the Laurentide Ice sheet disrupted atmospheric circulation and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet increasingly influenced regional paleoceanography.\n",

The relationship between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and southern Amazon fires (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.003) was stronger than links between SSTs and either cyclones or fires alone, suggesting that fires and tropical cyclones were directly coupled to the same underlying atmospheric dynamics governing tropical moisture redistribution. These relationships help explain why seasonal outlook forecasts for hurricanes and Amazon fires both failed in 2013 and may enable the design of improved early warning systems for drought and fire in Amazon forests.\n",

Past research has focused upon\nfinding a specific size range for individual species in lieu of other\nidentifiable features, thus allowing ocean parameters from a particular constant\n(i.e. a specific depth or season) to be reconstructed. Single-shell isotope\nanalysis of fossil shells from a mid-latitude North Atlantic Ocean\npiston core covering Termination III (200 to 250 ka) highlight the\nadvantage of using a dynamic size range, i.e. utilising measurements from\nmultiple narrow sieve size fractions spanning a large range of total body\nsizes, in studies of palaeoclimate. Using this methodology, we show that\nisotopic offsets between specimens in successive size fractions of\n<i>Globorotalia inflata</i> and <i>Globorotalia truncatulinoides</i> are\nnot constant over time, contrary to previous findings. For \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O in\nsmaller-sized globorotalids (212\u2013250 \u03bcm) it is suggested that the\noffset from other size fractions may reflect a shallower habitat in an early\nontogenetic stage. A reduction in the difference between small and large\nspecimens of <i>G. inflata</i> between insolation minima and maxima is\ninterpreted to relate to a prolonged period of reduced water column\nstratification. For the shallow-dwelling species <i>Globigerina\nbulloides</i>, no size\u2013isotope difference between size fractions is observed, and\nthe variability in the oxygen isotopic values is shown to correlate well\nwith the seasonal insolation patterns.

The deep-sea sedimentary record can provide valuable insight on the marine ecosystem response to this protracted global warming event and consequently on the ecological changes during this time. Here we present new benthic foraminiferal assemblage data from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1051 in the subtropical North Atlantic, spanning the MECO and post-MECO interval (41.1 to 39.5\u2009Ma). We find little change in the species composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages during the studied interval, suggesting that the rate of environmental change was gradual enough that these organisms were able to adapt. However, we identify two transient intervals associated with peak warming (higher-productivity interval (HPI)-1; 40.07\u201339.96\u2009Ma) and shortly after the MECO (HPI-2; 39.68\u201339.55\u2009Ma), where benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates increase by an order of magnitude. These HPIs at Site 1051 appear to coincide with intervals of strengthened productivity in the Tethys, Southern Ocean, and South Atlantic, and we suggest that an intensified hydrological cycle during the climatic warmth of the MECO was responsible for eutrophication of marine shelf and slope environments.\n",

Changes in SSA size distributions occurred during all phases of bacterial and phytoplankton growth, as characterized by cell concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total particulate carbon (TPC), and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP, gel-forming polysaccharides representing a major component of biogenic exudate material). Over a 2 week growth period, SSA particle concentrations increased by a factor of less than 2 when only bacteria were present and by a factor of about 3 when bacteria and phytoplankton were present. Production of jet generated SSA particles of diameter less than 200 nm increased with time, while production of all particle diameters increased with time when frits were used.

Here, we reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1087 in the Southeast Atlantic to investigate surface ocean circulation patterns during the late Pleistocene (0\u2013500 ka). The UK\u201937 index and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are used to reconstruct SSTs, \u03b4Dalkenone is used to reconstruct changes in sea-surface salinity, and mass accumulation rates of alkenones and chlorin pigments are quantified to detect changing marine export productivity.\nThe greatest amplitude of SST warming precedes decreases in benthic \u03b418O and therefore occurs early in the transition from glacials to interglacials. \u03b4Dalkenone, as a salinity indicator, increases before SSTs, suggesting that the pattern of Agulhas leakage is more complex than suggested by SST proxies. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 10 shows an anomalous pattern: it is marked by a pronounced increase in chlorin concentration, which may be related to enhanced/expanded Benguela upwelling reaching the core site. We find no evidence of an absence of Agulhas leakage throughout the record, suggesting there is no Agulhas cut-off even during MIS 10. Finally, the ODP site 1087 record shows an increasing strength of Agulhas leakage towards the present day, which may have impacted the intensity of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). As a result, the new analyses from ODP Site 1087 demonstrate a complex interaction between influences of the Benguela Upwelling and the Agulhas Leakage through the late Pleistocene, which are inferred here to reflect changing circulation patterns in the Southern Ocean and in the atmosphere.\n",

Pastor, J. A. Valiente, and M. J. Estrela<br /><br />Heavy rain events are frequently recorded in the Western Mediterranean\ncausing economic losses and even human casualties. The Western Mediterranean\nis a deep and almost closed sea surrounded by high mountain ranges and with\nlittle exchange of water with the Atlantic ocean. A main factor in the\ndevelopment of torrential rains is ocean-atmosphere exchanges of heat and\nmoisture that can potentially destabilize air masses travelling over the sea.\nThe study of air mass trajectories previous to the rain event permits the\nidentification of sea areas that could probably contribute to the development\nor intensification of rainfall. From a previous Mediterranean sea surface\ntemperature climatology, its spatio-temporal distribution patterns have been\nstudied showing two main distribution modes in winter and summer and\ntransitional regimes in spring and autumn. Hence, three heavy precipitation\nevents, for such winter and summer sea temperature regimes and for fall\ntransition, affecting the Valencia region have been selected to study the\neffect of sea surface temperature in torrential rains. Simulations with\nperturbed sea surface temperature in different areas along the air mass path\nwere run to compare results with unperturbed simulation. The variation of sea\nsurface temperature in certain areas caused significant changes in model\naccumulated values and its spatial distribution. Therefore, the existence of\nareas that at a greater extent favour air-sea interaction leading to the\ndevelopment of torrential rainfall in the Valencia region has been shown. This\nmethodology could be extended to the whole Mediterranean basin to look for\nsuch potential recharge areas. The identification of sea areas that\ncontribute to the development or intensification of heavy rain events in the\nMediterranean countries could be a useful prognosis and/or monitoring tool.",

Follows<br /><br />We present a numerical model of the ocean that couples a three-stream\nradiative transfer component with a marine biogeochemical\u2013ecosystem component in\na dynamic three-dimensional physical framework. The radiative transfer\ncomponent resolves the penetration of spectral irradiance as it is absorbed and\nscattered within the water column.  We explicitly include the effect of several\noptically important water constituents (different phytoplankton functional\ntypes; detrital particles; and coloured dissolved organic matter, CDOM). The\nmodel is evaluated against in situ-observed and satellite-derived products. In\nparticular we compare to concurrently measured biogeochemical, ecosystem, and\noptical data along a meridional transect of the Atlantic Ocean. The simulation\ncaptures the patterns and magnitudes of these data, and estimates surface\nupwelling irradiance analogous to that observed by ocean colour satellite\ninstruments.\nWe find that incorporating the different optically important\nconstituents explicitly and including spectral irradiance was crucial to\ncapture the variability in the depth of the  subsurface  chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>) maximum.\nWe conduct a series of sensitivity experiments to\n      demonstrate, globally, the relative importance of each of the water\n      constituents, as well as the crucial feedbacks between the light field,\n      the relative fitness of phytoplankton types, and the biogeochemistry\n      of the ocean.\n CDOM has proportionally more importance at attenuating light at\nshort wavelengths and in more productive waters, phytoplankton absorption is\nrelatively more important at the subsurface Chl <i>a</i>\nmaximum, and  water molecules have the greatest contribution\nwhen concentrations of other constituents are low, such as in the\noligotrophic gyres. Scattering had less effect on attenuation,\nbut since it is important for the amount and type of upwelling irradiance, it is\ncrucial for setting sea surface reflectance.\n   Strikingly, sensitivity experiments in which\n      absorption by any of the optical constituents was increased led to\n      a decrease in the size of the oligotrophic regions of the subtropical\n      gyres: lateral nutrient supplies were enhanced as a result of\n      decreasing high-latitude productivity.\nThis new model that\n      captures bio-optical feedbacks will be important for improving our\n      understanding of the role of light and optical constituents on ocean\n      biogeochemistry, especially in a changing environment.\n      Further, resolving surface upwelling irradiance will make it easier to\n      connect to satellite-derived products in the\n      future.",

The modes considered are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian (EA/WR) pattern and the Scandinavian (SCAN) pattern. The wave dataset consists of buoys records, remote sensing altimetry observations and a numerical hindcast providing significant wave height (SWH), mean wave period (MWP) and mean wave direction (MWD) for the period 1989\u20132009. After evaluating the reliability of the hindcast, we focus on the impact of each mode on seasonal wave parameters and on the relative importance of wind-sea and swell components. Results demonstrate that the NAO and EA patterns are the most relevant, whereas EA/WR and SCAN patterns have a weaker impact on the North Atlantic wave climate variability. During their positive phases, both NAO and EA patterns are related to winter SWH at a rate that reaches 1\u2009m per unit index along the Scottish coast (NAO) and Iberian coast (EA) patterns. In terms of winter MWD, the two modes induce a counterclockwise shift of up to 65\u00b0 per negative NAO (positive EA) unit over west European coasts. They also increase the winter MWP in the North Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (up to 1\u2009s per unit NAO) and along the western coasts of Europe and North Africa (1\u2009s per unit EA). The impact of winter EA pattern on all wave parameters is mostly caused through the swell wave component.\n",

Most of the infragravity wave energy is trapped or dissipated near coastlines, but a small percentage escapes into the open oceans. The source of deep ocean infragravity waves is debated, specifically whether they come mostly from regions with strong source waves or from sites with particular morphologies/orientations. We correlate measurements of infragravity waves in the deep North Atlantic Ocean with infragravity wave generation parameters throughout the Atlantic Ocean to find the dominant sources of deep ocean infragravity wave energy in the North Atlantic Ocean. The deep ocean infragravity wave data are from a 5 year deployment of absolute pressure gauges west of the Azores islands (37\u00b0N, 35\u00b0W) and shorter data sets from seafloor tsunami gauges (DART buoys). Two main sources are identified: one off of the west coast of southern Europe and northern Africa (25\u00b0N\u201340\u00b0N) in northern hemisphere winter and the other off the west coast of equatorial Africa (the Gulf of Guinea) in southern hemisphere winter. These regions have relatively weak source waves and weak infragravity wave propagation paths to the main measurement site, indicating that that the site morphology/orientation dominates the creation of deep ocean infragravity waves. Both regions have also been identified as potential sources of global seismological noise, suggesting that the same mechanisms may be behind the generation of deep ocean infragravity waves and global seismological noise in the frequency band from 0.001 to 0.04 Hz.\n",

The reliability is further decomposed into bias and dispersion by the reduced centered random variable (RCRV) score in order to investigate the reliability properties of the ensemble forecast system.

The causal factors of this extinction are poorly constrained, at least partially because the ecology of Discoaster is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between the extinction and environmental changes by comparing a suite of high-resolution nannofossil assemblage data at four Ocean Drilling Program sites to published environmental proxy records. Through the use of multivariate analysis, we determine Discoaster shared environmental preferences with the extant species Florisphaera profunda which thrives in the lower photic zone near the nutricline in locations where the water column is stratified. We show that the last occurrence of Discoaster was globally diachronous, rather than synchronous as previously thought, and likely took place in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. We propose that the demise of Discoaster was a two-stage process. A decrease in sea surface temperatures and increase in climate variability led to a global decline in Discoaster abundance. The extinction event itself correlates to shoaling of the nutricline as signified by a decrease in the carbon isotopic gradient between surface and thermocline foraminifera. We hypothesize that the combination of global cooling and a shoaling of the nutricline greatly reduced Discoaster's deepwater niche and contributed to its extinction. This may suggest that ocean stratification and the depth of the nutricline are important contributors to overall nannoplankton diversity.\n",

This study compares several forecasting methods using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to predict East African rains with various lead times. It is shown that the forecasts can explain more than 50% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The forecasts also explain more than 50% of the long rains (boreal spring) over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40% of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010\u20132011 forecasts for both the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.\n",

        "description": "\n\nExtratropical cyclone (ETC) tracks across eastern Canada are examined by applying a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to the lower-tropospheric relative vorticity field of reanalysis data. Both the seasonal cycle and the interannual variability of ETCs are quantified in terms of overall cyclone frequency, intensity, and regions of development and decay. We find that ETCs travelling to eastern Canada tend to develop over the Rockies, the Great Lakes and the US East Coast. The ETCs are most intense over Newfoundland and the North Atlantic Ocean, confirming previous findings. While ETCs at cities along the Atlantic coastline (e.g. St. John's) are dominated by East Coast cyclones (which are intense in winter), those inland (e.g. Toronto) track primarily from the Great Lakes. ETCs that develop over the Gulf of Mexico affect eastern Canada infrequently, but those that do tend to be intense. The interannual variability of the wintertime ETCs is influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Significant ENSO-related variability is found over most regions of southern Canada, except on the east coast. Although ETCs at Toronto are significantly modulated by ENSO, no visible changes are found at St. John's. These ENSO-related ETC changes are mostly due to the shifts in ETC development regions, with minor changes in the travelling direction of ETCs.\n",
