        "description": "\n\nThe wintertime East Asian eddy-driven jet (EAEJ) responding to climate change in the 21st century is studied using model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Compared to the location displacement in oceanic eddy-driven jets, the magnitude change of synoptic-scale transient eddy activities, measured by eddy kinetic energy (EKE), is a more striking feature in EAEJ. An intensified EKE is projected unanimously by CMIP5 models, suggesting that potential strong winter storm events are likely to happen in East Asian midlatitude in a warming climate. The future change of EKE in EAEJ can be understood in terms of growing baroclinicity wave. The upper level EKE is highly correlated to the low-level static stability, Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency (BVF). CMIP5 models generally project an intensified upper evel EKE with a reduced low-level BVF (\u0394EKE\u2009\u221d\u2009\u2212\u0394BVF). Meanwhile, the enhancement of EKE is also constrained by its historical state (\u0394EKE\u2009\u221d\u2009\u2212EKE). Intermodel variabilities among CMIP5 models reveal a similar but weaker relationship between \u0394BVF (or EKE) and \u0394EKE, indicating relatively large model diversities and independencies among CMIP5 models.\n",

Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied\nto identify the major VOC contributing sources and their temporal\nvariations. The secondary organic aerosols potential (SOAP) approach was\nused to estimate variations of precursor source contributions to SOA\nformation. The average VOC mixing ratios during the three periods were\n86.17, 48.28, and 72.97 ppbv, respectively. The mixing ratios of total VOC\nduring the control period were reduced by 44 %, and the mixing ratios of\nacetonitrile, halocarbons, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), aromatics, acetylene,\nalkanes, and alkenes decreased by approximately 65, 62, 54,\n53, 37, 36, and 23 %, respectively. The mixing ratios of all\nmeasured VOC species decreased during control, and the most affected species\nwere chlorinated VOCs (chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, chlorobenzene).\nPMF analysis indicated eight major sources of ambient VOCs, and emissions\nfrom target control sources were clearly reduced during the control period.\nCompared with the values before control, contributions of vehicular exhaust\nwere most reduced, followed by industrial manufacturing and solvent\nutilization. Reductions of these three sources were responsible for 50,\n26, and 16 % of the reductions in ambient VOCs. Contributions of\nevaporated or liquid gasoline and industrial chemical feedstock were\nslightly reduced, and contributions of secondary and long-lived species were\nrelatively stable. Due to central heating, emissions from fuel combustion\nkept on increasing during the whole campaign; because of weak control of\nliquid petroleum gas (LPG), the highest emissions of LPG occurred in the\ncontrol period. Vehicle-related sources were the most important precursor\nsources likely responsible for the reduction in SOA formation during this\ncampaign.",

        "description": "\n\nIn a changing climate, the impact of tropical cyclones on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts will be affected both by how intense and how frequent these storms become. The observational record of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin is too short (AD 1851-present) to allow for accurate assessment of low-frequency variability in storm activity. In order to overcome the limitations of the short observational record, we downscale four CMIP5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic basin that span the interval AD 850 \u2013 2005. Using these long-term synthetic tropical cyclone data sets, we investigate the relationship between power dissipation and ocean temperature metrics, as well as the relationship between basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone count statistics over the past millennium. Contrary to previous studies, we find only a very weak relationship between power dissipation and main development region sea surface temperature in the Atlantic basin. Consistent with previous studies, we find that basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone counts are significantly correlated with one another, lending further support for the use of paleohurricane landfall records to infer long-term basin-wide tropical cyclone trends.\n",

To what extent these changes are related to the formation of the ozone hole in the late twentieth century is an open question. Using a comprehensive chemistry-climate Earth system model, we contrast model runs with varying and with fixed surface concentrations of ozone depleting substances (ODS) from 1955 to 2005. In our model, ODS cause the majority of the summertime changes in surface wind stress which, in turn, induce a clear poleward shift of the ocean's meridional overturning circulation. In addition, more than 30% of the model changes in the temperature and salinity of the Southern Ocean are caused by ODS. These findings offer unambiguous evidence that increased concentrations of ODS in the late twentieth century are likely to have been been an important driver of changes in the Southern Ocean.\n",

However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that can significantly influence the rate of basal melting of Antarctic marine ice shelves and the associated SLR have not previously been considered. Here we use a fully coupled global climate model to investigate whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations after a period of global warming could preserve Antarctic ice sheets by cooling subsurface ocean temperatures. We contrast this climate engineering method with an alternative strategy in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract surface and upper level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing GHGs, resulting in continued upwelling of warm water in proximity of ice shelves, especially in the vicinity of the already unstable Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. By contrast, removal of GHGs restores the circulation, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures to better preserve West Antarctica.",

We perform simulations of three-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-system-resolving model, with interactive surface temperature, where a highly idealized, low heat capacity circular island is embedded in a slab-ocean domain. The calculated precipitation rate over the island can be more than double the domain average value, with island rainfall occurring primarily in an intense, regular thunderstorm system that forms in the afternoon to early evening each day. Island size affects the magnitude of simulated island rainfall enhancement, the intensity of the convection, and the timing of the rainfall maximum relative to solar noon. A combination of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms leads to a monotonic enhancement of domain-averaged tropospheric temperature with increasing fraction of island surface, which may contribute to localization of ascent over the Maritime Continent and its relationship to the Walker Circulation.\nThunderstorm in the Maritime Continent region, looking east in the early morning from the Makassar Strait toward Sulawesi.

The spatial pattern and intensity of the PMM were found to be reasonably simulated by CMIP5 models, as was the subtropical atmosphere\u2013ocean coupling associated with the PMM. However, the persistence of the coupling, which sustains the PMM's duration and extends its pattern equatorward, was found to be underestimated in most of the CMIP5 models. Many of the simulated PMMs do not have a pattern that extends far enough into the tropical Pacific to influence El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The CMIP5 models that do produce longer persistence for the PMM coupling show a higher correlation of the PMM with the Central-Pacific (CP) type of ENSO than with the Eastern-Pacific (EP) type of the ENSO. This study concludes that (1) the PMM and its associated subtropical Pacific ocean\u2013atmosphere coupling are important to the generation of the CP type of ENSO; (2) the so-called seasonal footprinting mechanism that sustains an equatorward extension of the PMM is not well simulated in a majority of the CMIP5 models; and (3) the persistence of the subtropical Pacific coupling is more important than the other properties in gauging a model's skill in the PMM simulation.\n",

This study therefore attempts to identify the predictors (with a 1-month lead time) for some of the subregional intraseasonal statistics of wet and dry spells (SRISS) which showed the greatest predictability potential during the short rainfall season over EEA. Correlation analysis between the SRISS and seasonal rainfall totals on one hand and the predefined predictors on the other hand were initially computed and those that were significant at 95% confidence levels retained. To identify additional potential predictors, partial correlation analyses were undertaken between SRISS and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric fields while controlling the effects of the predefined predictors retained earlier. Cross-validated multivariate linear regression (MLR) models were finally developed and their residuals assessed for independence and for normal distribution. Four large-scale oceanic and atmospheric predictors with robust physical/dynamical linkages with SRISS were identified for the first time. The cross-validated MLR models for the SRISS of wet spells and seasonal rainfall totals mainly picked two of these predictors around the Bay of Bengal. The two predictors combined accounted for 39.5% of the magnitude of the SST changes between the July\u2013August and October\u2013November\u2013December periods over the Western Pole of the Indian Ocean Dipole, subsequently impacting EEA rainfall. MLR models were defined yielding cross-validated correlations between observed and predicted values of seasonal totals and number of wet days ranging from 0.60 to 0.75, depending on the subregion. MLR models could not be developed over a few of the subregions suggesting that the local factors could have masked the global and regional signals encompassed in the additional potential predictors.\n",
