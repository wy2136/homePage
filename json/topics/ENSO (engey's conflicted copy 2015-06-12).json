Forecast of vegetation anomalies at 1\u20133 months lead time can help in decision making. Here, we show that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with other hydroclimatic variables (soil moisture and sea surface temperature) can be effectively used to predict vegetation anomalies in India. The spatiotemporal analysis of NDVI showed significant greening over the region during the period of 1982\u20132013. The root zone soil moisture showed a positive correlation with NDVI whereas the ENSO index (Nino 3.4) is negatively correlated in most of the regions. We extended this relationship to develop a model to predict NDVI in 1 to 3 months lead time. The predicted vegetation anomalies compare well with observations, which can be effectively utilized in early warning and better planning in water resources and agricultural sectors in India.",

        "description": "\n\nThe spring predictability barrier increases the uncertainty in ENSO forecasts starting before and during the boreal spring. Recent work has shown that the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is responsible for phase-locking of peak ENSO development to the boreal winter, suggesting that this annual cycle may play a role in the spring predictability barrier. To test this hypothesis, the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is added to a damped, noise driven conceptual recharge oscillator model. When the annual cycle of ENSO growth rate is included, a spring predictability barrier develops whereas without it ENSO predictability is independent of the forecast start date. When state-dependent noise is included in the simulations in addition to the annual cycle of the growth rate, the spring predictability barrier is enhanced and more realistic.",

Using observed precipitation, the NINO3.4 index and soil moisture and evapotranspiration simulated by a land surface model for 61 years, analysis was performed using partial correlations to evaluate to what extent land surface and SST anomaly of El Ni\u00f1o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can affect seasonal precipitation over different regions and seasons. Results show that antecedent soil moisture is as important as concurrent ENSO condition in controlling rainfall anomalies over the U.S., but they generally dominate in different seasons with SST providing more predictability during winter while soil moisture, through its linkages to evapotranspiration and snow water, has larger influence in spring and early summer. The proposed methodology is applicable to climate model outputs to evaluate the intensity of land-atmosphere coupling and its relative importance.",

However, the impact of warmer mean SST is more efficient in the intensifying El Ni\u00f1o than La Ni\u00f1a, because of the nature of the exponential growth of atmospheric convection to SST change. Moreover, the farther eastward shift of the atmospheric convection during the negative AMO leads to the stronger El Ni\u00f1o due to the longer delayed negative feedback by oceanic waves. Therefore, the AMO mainly influences the El Nino intensity rather than La Nina intensity.\n",

        "description": "\nEven though the vital role of thermocline fluctuation in El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle has been established previously, the direct relationship between the thermocline depth and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial Pacific is yet to be fully understood, especially its seasonality. Thermocline depth anomalies have been found to lead SST anomalies in time with a longitude-dependent delay, but our study also suggests that the relationship shows considerable seasonal dependency and is strongest (weakest) during the boreal spring (summer). Over the eastern equatorial Pacific where there is least delay (compared to that in the western and central Pacific), the connection between thermocline and SST is the weakest during the boreal spring. This feature may be one of causes for ENSO spring persistence barrier. Furthermore, the thermocline-SST connections exhibit significant decadal variations, which are remarkably consistent with the decadal changes in the persistence barrier of SST anomalies over the eastern Pacific. It is also found that the decadal shift in the timing of the thermocline-SST connection barrier is caused by the changes in the seasonal cycle of tropical trade winds and thermocline depths.",

CMIP5 models can simulate the ENSO-monsoon spatial structure reasonably well when using the multimodel mean. Running correlations show prominent decadal variability of the ENSO-monsoon relationship in observations. The modeled ENSO-monsoon relation shows large intermodel spread, indicating large variations across the model ensemble. The anthropogenically forced component of ENSO-monsoon relationship is separated from the naturally varying component based on a signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function analysis using global sea surface temperature (SST). Results show that natural variability plays a dominant role in the varied ENSO-monsoon relationship during the 20th century. In the 21st century, the forced component is dominated by enhanced monsoon rainfall associated with SST warming, which may contribute to a slightly weakened ENSO-monsoon relation in the future.",

Multidecadal changes in the ocean mean state are hence likely to modulate ENSO properties. To better link background state variations with low-frequency amplitude changes of ENSO, we develop a diagnostic framework that determines locally the contributions of different physical feedback terms on the ocean surface temperature variance. Our analysis shows that multidecadal changes of ENSO variance originate from the delicate balance between the background-state-dependent positive thermocline feedback and the atmospheric damping of sea surface temperatures anomalies. The role of higher-order processes and atmospheric and oceanic nonlinearities is also discussed. The diagnostic tool developed here can be easily applied to other tropical ocean areas and climate phenomena.",

While the warm phase of ENSO promotes drier and warmer than normal conditions across the region during winter and spring that favor widespread fire activity the following summer, a reduction in VLFs was found during the warm phase of ENSO during summer concurrent with the fire season. This paradox is primarily tied to an anomalous upper level trough over the western U.S. and positive anomalies in integrated water vapor that extend over the northwestern U.S. during summers when the warm phase of ENSO is present. Collectively, these features result in widespread increases in precipitation amount during the summer and a curtailment of periods of critically low-fuel moistures that can carry wildfire.",

Here we show that the anomalous zonal advection of warm water is the major process that pushes El Ni\u00f1o to extremes and that this anomalous advection results from the coupling of oceanic currents with eastward migration of the atmospheric convection; a greater zonal advection is associated with a greater extent of the eastward migration. By contrast, there is a limited extent for westward migration during La Ni\u00f1a. Climate models that successfully simulate the amplitude asymmetry display a systematic linkage of a greater longitudinal movement of the convection center with a stronger zonal advection and greater El Ni\u00f1o amplitude. In a warming world, the longitudinal migration of convection response increases, as does the role of zonal advection, increasing the frequency of future extremes of El Ni\u00f1o.",

        "description": "\n\nRadiosonde-based tropical expansion rate estimates for six continental-centred regions of the globe are discussed. New results from the Northern Hemisphere are presented, complementing previous Southern Hemisphere (SH) results using an identical methodology. Expansion rates are largest over Asia and Australia-New Zealand (ANZ). Other regions show more modest rates of expansion, and there is no statistically significant expansion over North America. In the hemispheric average, expansion rates are slightly larger in the SH. This asymmetry, although not statistically significant, is consistent with ozone depletion acting as a co-driver of tropical expansion since 1979. The picture of regional expansion here is different from that in other studies or that derived solely from reanalyses. The relationships between tropical expansion and modes of climate variability are explored using partial regression techniques. Interannually, a relationship is seen with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) across most of the globe. Regionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has a significant impact over Asia while the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) affects expansion over ANZ. Considering the longer-term changes in the climate variability indices since 1979, suggests that the PDO may account for up to 50% of the observed tropical expansion over Asia, while SAM may account for 20-30% of the SH expansion, particularly over ANZ. Decadal changes in ENSO may account for a further 20-30% of the global and regional trends. Accounting for the effect of climate variability helps to reconcile the differences in observations and model-based simulations of tropical expansion.",

        "description": "\n\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of the trends of stratospheric ozone in the mid-latitudes and subtropics. The analysis is performed using ground-based and space-based measurements over the Light detection and ranging (lidar) stations for the period 1985\u20132012. Also, trends are estimated for the zonal mean data made from a merged satellite data set, GOZCARDS (Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere) over 1979\u20132012. The linear trends in stratospheric ozone are estimated using piece-wise linear trend (PWLT) functions. The ozone trends during the increasing phase of halogens (before 1997) range from \u22120.2\u00b10.08 to \u22121\u00b10.07 % year\u22121 in the mid-latitudes and \u22120.2\u00b10.06 to \u22120.7\u00b10.05 % year\u22121 in the subtropics at 15\u201345 km, depending on altitude. In 1997\u20132012, the PWLT analyses show a positive trend, significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence intervals, toward ozone recovery in the middle and low latitude upper stratosphere (35\u201345 km), and the trends are about \u00b10.5\u00b10.07 % year\u22121 at mid-latitudes and about \u00b10.3\u00b10.05 % year\u22121 at subtropical latitudes. However, negative and insignificant trends are estimated in the lower stratosphere (15\u201320 km) over 1997\u20132012 in the mid-latitudes, mainly due to the dynamics, as demonstrated by the large (50\u201360%) contributions from the quasi-biennial oscillation, El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and planetary wave activity to recent ozone changes. This suggests that the ozone changes are governed by the interannual variations in meteorology and dynamics of the regions; these factors will influence the recovery detection time and the behavior of the recovery path to pre-1980 levels.",

        "description": "\n\nTo assess published hypotheses surrounding the recent slowdown in surface warming (hiatus) we compare five available global observational surface temperature estimates to two thirty member ensembles from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). Model ensembles are initialized in 1980 from the transient historical runs and driven with forcings used in the CMIP5 experiments and updated forcings based upon current observational understanding, described in Part 1. The ensembles\u2019 surface temperature trends are statistically indistinguishable over 1998-2012 despite differences in the prescribed forcings. There is thus no evidence that forcing errors play a significant role in explaining the hiatus according to NorESM. The observations fall either towards the lower portion of the ensembles or, for some observational estimates and regions, outside. The exception is the Arctic where the observations fall towards the upper ensemble bounds. Observational dataset choices can make a large difference to findings of consistency or otherwise. Those NorESM ensemble members that exhibit nino3.4 SST trends similar to observed also exhibit comparable tropical and to some extent global-mean trends, supporting a role for ENSO in explaining the hiatus. Several ensemble members capture the marked seasonality observed in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude trends, with cooling in the wintertime and warming in the remaining seasons. Overall, we find that we cannot falsify NorESM as being capable of explaining the observed hiatus behavior. Importantly, this is not equivalent to concluding NorESM could simultaneously capture all important facets of the hiatus. Similar experiments with further, distinct, Earth System Models are required to verify our findings.",

It is shown that, the preonset positive (negative) rainfall anomaly over northwest India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran is associated with decrease (increase) in ISMR, primarily in the months of June and July, which in turn affects the seasonal mean. ISMR in the months of June and July is also strongly linked with the preonset 2\u2009m air temperature over the same regions. The preonset rainfall/2\u2009m air temperature variability is linked with stationary Rossby wave response, which is clearly evident in the wave activity flux diagnostics. As the predictability of Indian summer monsoon relies mainly on the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the found link may further enhance our ability to predict the monsoon, particularly during a non-ENSO year.",

        "description": "\nThe transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to midlatitude dynamics. We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60\u00b0N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)\u2014anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68% of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60\u00b0N in winter and 56% in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams\u2014AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60\u00b0N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.",

        "description": "\nThe present study investigates the impacts of the two components of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) variability on sea surface temperature (SST) changes in the western North Pacific. When the EAWM is stronger than normal, significant negative SST anomalies form in the East Asian marginal seas and subtropical western North Pacific and persist from winter to the following spring. It is found that winter-spring SST anomalies in the Yellow Sea and the Japan Sea have a close association with the northern component of the EAWM variability, whereas the southern component has a large impact on SST changes in subtropical western North Pacific. The two components induce SST anomalies through both surface heat flux and oceanic advection changes. The surface latent heat flux is predominantly responsible for SST changes. The oceanic advection has a secondary contribution to the SST change in subtropical western North Pacific associated with the northern component and in the Japan Sea associated with the southern component. The surface latent heat flux anomalies associated with the northern component are induced through changes in both wind speed and sea-air humidity difference, and those associated with the southern component are induced mainly through changes in sea-air humidity difference north of 20\u00b0N. The SST anomalies induced by the northern component are mostly independent of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). While ENSO has a large effect on the SST anomalies in open oceanic regions, the southern component has a dominant contribution independent of ENSO to the SST anomalies in the marginal seas.",

        "description": "\n\nThe Southeast Pacific, which encompasses the coasts of Peru and Chile, is one of the world's most productive regions resulting principally from the upwelling of subsurface nutrient-rich waters. Over the satellite altimetry era, there have been numerous evidence that surface mesoscale eddies play an important role in the offshore transport of rich coastal waters, but it has been only recently that few observational/numerical studies have highlighted the importance of the subsurface eddies. The eddy field variability is explored using the results of a high-resolution model experiment from 1979 to 2012. The model results indicate an asymmetry of the surface and subsurface eddy fields. While surface-intensified cyclones are slightly more frequent than anticyclones, the subsurface field is dominated by anticyclones (IntrathermoclineEddies; ITEs), triggered by the instability of the subsurface Peru Chile undercurrent (PCUC). Composite maps are consistent with in-situ observations. ITEs are associated with maximum vorticity around 150-200 m depth, warmer and more saline core, characteristic of the equatorial subsurface water from the PCUC. We find that the variability of the ITEs is significantly correlated with the ENSO equatorial signal. During strong El Ni\u00f1o events (e.g. 1982; 1998), we find that while the PCUC transport increases, the volume of coastal waters transported by ITEs however decreases during those periods. We find that the relaxation of the isopycnals along the coast during El Ni\u00f1o events leads to weakened baroclinic instability and to a decrease of the ITEs transport.

        "description": "\n\nIt has been suggested that the strength asymmetry of the Bjerknes feedback is responsible for the pronounced amplitude asymmetry between eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) El Ni\u00f1o events. Detailed analyses have indicated that this strength asymmetry is mainly derived from the weaker sensitivity of the zonal sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly to that of the diabatic heating anomaly during the development phase of CP El Ni\u00f1o events, which mainly results from the large cancelation induced by the negative sea surface temperature (SST)\u2013cloud thermodynamic feedback that negates the positive dynamical feedback. This study validates these conclusions by using historical runs of 20 models involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Our results suggest that the CMIP5 models generally depict the asymmetry in amplitude between the two types of El Ni\u00f1o events well, which is consistent with successfully simulating the strength asymmetry of the Bjerknes feedback. As observed during both types of El Ni\u00f1o events, variations in the total cloud amount and short wave radiation also indicated that the cloud radiative effect is an important factor that causes amplitude asymmetry between CP and EP El Ni\u00f1o events. However, the CMIP5 models are severely biased when capturing realistic CP El Ni\u00f1o structures, namely few models can simulate the significantly weaker warming anomalies in the EP relative to the CP.

The variability in surface chlorophyll-a is shown to be complex. Whereas the spring bloom generates the highest phytoplankton concentration for coastal Alaska, the north and east coasts of Haida Gwaii, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and coastal Oregon and California, it is the fall bloom that normally generates the highest concentration for the west coast of Vancouver Island, Juan de Fuca Strait, and the west coast of Washington. The highest satellite-sensed chlorophyll concentrations occur in the Strait of Georgia, where mean values are at least two times higher than elsewhere in the northeast Pacific. Moreover, the annual average surface chlorophyll concentration has increased significantly in the Strait of Georgia from 5.9 mg m\u22123 in 1998 (a major El Ni\u00f1o year) to 8.9 mg m\u22123 in 2010 (a moderate El Ni\u00f1o year), suggesting an enhancement of biological productivity. Similarly, surface chlorophyll in the waters north and east of Haida Gwaii increased from 2.0 mg m\u22123 in 1998 to 2.8 mg m\u22123 in 2010. In all British Columbia regions, except the Strait of Georgia, the annual average chlorophyll concentration was highest in 2008, a year with prolonged La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the North Pacific. In the Strait of Georgia, the highest chlorophyll concentration was observed during the near neutral ENSO conditions of the spring of 2007. This article is protected by copyright.

Analysis of in situ data over a grid of hydrographic stations and oblique zooplankton hauls with bongo net (505 \u00b5m) was combined with orthogonal robust functions decomposition applied to altimetry anomalies obtained from satellite. During both cool (March and June) and warm (August and November) periods, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity Index defined three recurrent larval fish habitats which varied in species composition and extent as a function of the environmental scales. The variability of the Tropical larval fish habitat (characterized by high species richness, and dominated by Vinciguerria lucetia, Diogenichthys laternatus, and Diaphus pacificus) was associated with the seasonal changes. The Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat (dominated by V. lucetia and D. laternatus, with lower mean abundance and lower species richness than in the Tropical habitat) and Coastal-and-Upwelling larval fish habitat (dominated by Bregmaceros bathymaster) was associated mainly with mesoscale activity induced by eddies and with coastal upwelling. During February 2010, the Tropical larval fish habitat predominated offshore and the Transitional-California Current larval fish habitat was not present, which we attribute to the effect of El Ni\u00f1o conditions. Thus, the mesoscale, seasonal, and interannual environmental scales affect the composition and extension of larval fish habitats.\n",

Such sea level variability should be taken into consideration when planning efforts to mitigate the effects of future sea level change. In this study, we quantify the contribution to regional sea level of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Through cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis (CSEOF) of the long reconstructed sea level data set and of a set of U.S. tide gauges, two global modes dominated by Pacific Ocean variability are identified and related to ENSO and, by extension, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. By estimating the combined contribution of these two modes to regional sea level, we find that ENSO can contribute significantly on short time scales, with contributions of up to 20 cm along the west coast of the U.S. The CSEOF decomposition of the long tide gauge records around the U.S. highlights the influence of ENSO on the U.S. east coast. Tandem analyses of both the reconstructed and tide gauge records also examine the utility of the sea level reconstructions for near-coast studies.\n",

A 60 year hindcast allows investigation of the influence of decadal climate variability on long-term trends of North Atlantic wave power, PW, spanning the 1948\u20132008 epoch. PW variations over much of the eastern North Atlantic are strongly influenced by the fluctuating North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) atmospheric circulation pattern, consistent with previous studies of significant wave height, Hs. Wave activity in the western Atlantic also responds to fluctuations in Pacific climate modes, including the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern and the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation. The magnitude of upward long-term trends during winter over the northeast Atlantic is strongly influenced by heightened storm activity under the extreme positive phase of winter NAO in the early 1990s. In contrast, PW along the United States East Coast shows no increasing trend, with wave activity there most closely associated with the PNA. Strong wave power \u201cevents\u201d exhibit significant upward trends along the Atlantic coasts of Iceland and Europe during winter months. Importantly, in opposition to the long-term increase of PW, a recent general decrease in PW across the North Atlantic from 2000 to 2008 occurred. The 2000\u20132008 decrease was associated with a general shift of winter NAO to its negative phase, underscoring the control exerted by fluctuating North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on PW trends.\n",

In addition to the broad agreement with earlier studies on the north-to-south gradient of surface salinity and general features of seasonal variability of salinity, the data also revealed few episodes of enhanced freshening in the BoB. The observations showed distinct anomalous low salinity (< 2 psu) waters in the northern BoB during June\u2013February of the years 2006\u20132007 (Y67), 2011\u20132012 (Y12), and 2012\u20132013 (Y23). The anomalous freshening during these years showed similar life cycle, such as, it starts in the northern BoB during July\u2013September of current summer and extends up to February\u2013March of next winter with a southward propagation. Analysis showed that the oceanic and atmospheric conditions associated with positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) lead to these freshening events, and IOD rather than El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) controls the interannual variability of salinity in the BoB. The mixed layer salt budget analysis indicated the dominant role of local fresh water flux (horizontal advection) on the observed salinity tendency during summer (winter) monsoon season. Enhanced precipitation associated with pIOD lead to enhanced freshening in northern BoB during June\u2013September, which remained to this region with prevailing summer monsoon circulation. The weakening or absence of southward east India coastal current (EICC) during October\u2013December of these freshening years trapped anomalous freshwater in the northern BoB.\n",

Yet, continuous ITF measurement is difficult and expensive. The longest time series of in situ measurements of the ITF to date were taken in the Makassar Strait, the main pathway of the ITF. Here we have demonstrated a plausible approach to derive the ITF transport proxy using satellite altimetry sea surface height (SSH), gravimetry ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data, in situ measurements from the Makassar Strait from 1996 to 1998 and 2004 to 2011, and a theoretical formulation. We first identified the optimal locations of the correlation between the observed ITF transport through the Makassar Strait and the pressure gradients, represented by the SSH and OBP differences between the Pacific and Indian Oceans at a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 horizontal resolution.

        "description": "\n\nLow-salinity water with two cores is found off West Luzon Island in the South China Sea (SCS) during summer. A series of salinity observations and model results show that the low-salinity water begins to appear in June, reaches its lowest salinity in September, and disappears after October. Rainfall associated with the summer monsoon impinging on the Philippine mountain ranges plays an important role in the formation of the low-salinity water, while upward Ekman pumping of high-salinity subsurface water caused by the strong winter monsoon is important for its disappearance. Variation in mixed layer depth is responsible for the formation of the two cores of the low-salinity water, while advection also contributes. The study further demonstrates that the low-salinity water has considerable interannual variability associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): during the summer of the decaying year of an El Ni\u00f1o, an anticyclonic wind anomaly occurs in the SCS. The anticyclonic wind anomaly is associated with a northeasterly anomaly south of 18\u00b0N, reducing precipitation and causing salting of the low-salinity water off West Luzon Island. The situation is reversed during the summer of the decaying year of a La Ni\u00f1a.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) transports water originating from a number of distinct source regions, eastward across the Pacific Ocean. It is responsible for supplying nutrients to the productive eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Of particular importance is the transport of iron by the EUC; the limiting nutrient in that region. Although the mean circulation and sources of EUC water are reasonably well understood, it is unclear how the contribution of water from these sources to the EUC vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. Here a Lagrangian analysis is applied to the eddy-resolving OFAM3 ocean simulation in order to identity variability in the makeup of the EUC over an 18 year period (1993\u20132010). While ENSO has an influence on the variability of source transport contributions to the EUC, the signal of increased (decreased) transport of water from the LLWBCs during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) periods does not translate to substantial changes in the makeup of the EUC between 165\u00b0E and 140\u00b0W. It is hypothesized that this is due to the large spread in travel times of water parcels as they travel from the source regions into the EUC. The consequent erosion of transport anomalies generated at the different western boundary source regions associated with ENSO may help explain why previous studies found little relationship between variability in iron fluxes off Papua New Guinea shelves and the chlorophyll response in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n",

        "description": "\n\nWe present coral and sclerosponge based reconstructions of the 14C content in North Atlantic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during the last ~100 years from the subtropical cells (STCs). These waters are sensitive to the dynamics of the shallow overturning meridional circulation that transports heat and water masses from the subtropics to the tropics. We use these records to investigate the circulation patterns of the off-equatorial upwelling regions of the STCs, which are not well understood. Coral and sclerosponge skeletons provide long time-series of ocean DIC 14C content, a tracer of oceanic circulation, effectively extending the observational record back in time. Sclerosponge data from the Bahamas were used to extend the existing subtropical 14C time series to the 21st century. Coral 14C data from the Cape Verde Islands (1890\u20132002) captured the 14C signature of water brought to the surface in the off-equatorial regions of the STC present near the West African coast. We observe a unique post-bomb trend at Cape Verde that is similar to the upwelling regions in the Pacific, and we interpret this trend as the result of the slow penetration of bomb 14C into the interior ocean as part of the STC circulation. Using a multi-box mixing model we constrain the time history of bomb 14C in the eastern tropical Atlantic, and we estimate a 20-year timescale for ventilation of the thermocline in this area of the Ocean. The similarity between the Atlantic and Pacific 14C-based records of upwelling suggests that both are caused by bomb 14C penetration rather than more complex explanations that invoke changes in thermocline depth (e.g., related to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation variability) or changes in the strength of the subtropical cells. Our results offer constraints for models of tropical ocean circulation and anthropogenic CO2 uptake that attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the shallow wind driven circulation in the Atlantic.",

        "description": "\nThe response of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to mid-Holocene boundary conditions remains an open question: paleoclimate proxies and climate model simulations do not agree in the magnitude of the reduction of ENSO variability, while recent proxy evidence from fossil corals from the central Pacific show that the reduction in mid-Holocene ENSO variability compared to the end of the twentieth century is not different from the reduction during other Holocene time intervals. This is inconsistent with the interpretation of lake and ocean sediment records from the eastern Pacific, which show a significant reduction compared to all other Holocene periods. In order to reconcile the seemingly conflicting proxy evidence from the eastern and central Pacific, we hypothesize that ENSO remained active during the mid-Holocene; however, there was a change in the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies, also known as ENSO flavors. Using National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model version 4 forced with mid-Holocene orbital conditions, we find that the frequency of occurrence of the strongest eastern Pacific (EP) events decreases in the mid-Holocene and their variance is reduced by \u223c30%, while the frequency of central Pacific (CP) events slightly increases and their variance does not change. We also find a shift in the seasonality of EP events, but not in that of CP events. Lastly, mid-Holocene EP events develop more slowly and decay faster. The differential response of ENSO flavors to mid-Holocene forcing is remotely forced by the West Pacific, where a weakening of the trade winds in early boreal spring in the mid-Holocene initiates an anomalous downwelling annual Kelvin wave, which reaches the eastern Pacific during the ENSO development season, weakens the upper ocean stratification, and results in reduced ENSO upwelling feedback. The simulated reduction in the EP flavor versus the CP flavor in the mid-Holocene is consistent with proxy evidence: The teleconnection patterns of the two flavors with temperature, precipitation, and salinity are distinct, and proxies from different regions of the Pacific might be recording variability associated with only one of the flavors, or some combination of their relative effects.",

EOF analysis is then applied to both the fast and predictable components. We find that (1) the most predictable signal migrates in a north\u2013south direction along with the annual cycle of the monsoon in east China, while spatial patterns of the leading fast modes does not change much; (2) the predictable signal of precipitation in eastern China is associated with anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns having more zonally symmetric structures while the fast time-varying precipitation components are accompanied by wavy anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns; (3) the most predictable signal has an apparent 1-season lagged correlation with the interannual variation of sea surface temperature associated with El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation; (4) The fast rainfall component is largely attributed to the intraseasonal variabilities of the Siberian High over the Eurasian continent and the subtropical high associated with the Western-Pacific-Oscillation-like variabilities over the North Pacific; and (5) The ENSO signal in the fall seasonal precipitation persisted throughout the entire 54-year period while the signal in winter intensified significantly after the mid-1970s.

Linear Inverse Models (LIMs) constructed from tropical sea surface temperature, thermocline depth and zonal wind stress anomalies from each of the periods 1959\u20131978 and 1979\u20131998, are able to reproduce the major observed characteristics of ENSO, including its amplitude, frequency and time evolution. Each LIM possesses low-frequency and biennial ENSO modes, the former being both the least damped and the mode responsible for strongest pseudoresonance, as quantified via calculation of the resolvent norm. Because these modes are damped, ENSO variability is sustained in the stochastically forced LIMs by transiently growing perturbations, and predictability is determined by the character of the transiently growing subspace of perturbations. The optimal linear precursor over any given lead time is equivalent to the optimal perturbation of the LIM, that represents the most rapidly growing linear perturbation over that timescale. In both periods linear ENSO growth occurs through one of two trajectories associated with the 7 and 15 month optimal perturbations. The structure of these two optimal perturbations change significantly between the two periods, and their ability to predict ENSO degrades dramatically when applied to the alternate period. This suggests that ENSO precursors changed following the 1970s climate shift over both 7 and 15 month time-scales. In particular, while prior to the climate shift the heat content of the equatorial Pacific alone is a skillful ENSO predictor on 7 month lead times, afterwards Indian and south Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies are inferred to have become important. Optimal ENSO growth over 15 months also contains a significant extra-Pacific contribution, and it is possible to skillfully hindcast some (but not all) ENSO events in both periods over 15 month lead times. Of the four considered linear precursors, only the 7 month optimal perturbation corresponding to the period 1959\u20131978 is able to skillfully hindcast ENSO amplitude from 1998 to the present, correctly predicting the development of El Ni\u00f1o conditions since February 2014. As such the optimal precursor structure appears to be related to the phase of the IPO, and we conjecture that extra-Pacific teleconnections may gain importance during a positive phase of the IPO.</p>\n                  ",

Our results indicate that TCs play a prominent role in extreme rainfall over much Australia, with more than half of the highest annual rainfall events associated with these storms over the coastal regions and in particular over Western Australia. Moreover, the TC fractional contribution to extreme rainfall increases as we focus on the largest rainfall events, with approximately 66\u2013100% of annual maxima in excess of 100\u2009mm (\u223c4\u2009inches) over Western Australia associated with TCs at over one third of the locations.

A larger probability of having an annual rainfall maximum related to TCs occurs during La Ni\u00f1a years, consistent with enhanced Australian cyclogenesis during these phases of ENSO.

Results suggest that the ISV characteristics show some differences in the two types of El Ni\u00f1o, although both oscillate along the thermocline in the form of the intraseasonal equatorial Kelvin wave (IEKW), which is excited in the western tropical Pacific by the zonal wind stress associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO). First, the period of dominant mode of the STA ISV during CP El Ni\u00f1o broadly distributes in 50\u201380 days with the spectra peaking in 60\u201365 days. By contrast, the spectrum of STA ISV during EP El Ni\u00f1o shows a peak in 75\u201380-day period. This indicates that the wave speed is faster in the CP El Ni\u00f1o than in EP El Ni\u00f1o.

Third, the strongest IEKW occurs in the CP around the dateline during CP El Ni\u00f1o and attenuates quickly east of 130\u00b0W due to strong eddy viscosity dissipation, while the IEKW during the EP El Ni\u00f1o propagates efficiently from the western to the eastern Pacific with a relative weak diffusion.\n",

The time series of the ENSO-like pattern significantly correlates with the EAWM index for the period 1949\u20132004 based on the HadISST SST data set and the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. Their correlation coefficient is \u22120.32 at the 95% confidence level. The warm (cold) phase of ENSO-like SSTAs is associated with a weakened (strengthened) Siberian High and an eastern-positioned (western-positioned) Aleutian Low, anomalous southerly (northerly) wind at 850 hPa and positive (negative) surface air temperature anomalies over East Asia and western North Pacific, while 300 hPa zonal wind anomalies emerge with a reduced (accelerated) East Asian jet stream.\nFurther model examination reveals that the simulated response over East Asia forced by warm (cold) ENSO-like SSTAs in CCM3 and the three-model ensemble corresponds to the weakened (strengthened) EAWM. The spatial correlation coefficients between the three-model ensemble and observation in the atmospheric circulation and surface air temperature range from 0.15 to 0.80 at the 99% confidence level. This success in simulating relationship between ENSO-like SSTAs and EWAM using three-model ensemble proposes a new idea for the EAWM prediction.\n",

This study investigates how Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models represent different types of ENSO and how they represent teleconnections to South American precipitation. It is found that the CMIP5 models can represent the basic structure of SST anomalies that occur during different types of ENSO events and these are described using simple SST indices. Most of the CMIP5 models can reproduce the correct sign of precipitation anomalies in northeast South America during austral summer and autumn, in cases where the observed teleconnections are relatively strong. The same is also true of north South America in austral summer. In the east and southeast regions of South America, many models fail to reproduce the correct sign during both Canonical and Modoki/Central Pacific/Warm Pool ENSO events. The precipitation composites in Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) models tend to agree with their CMIP5 counterparts, so we conclude that the errors in teleconnections are not principally driven by mean SST biases. Precipitation teleconnections in the northern regions are shown to be linked to variations in the Walker circulation in models, with the exception of that in north South America during March\u2013May. During March\u2013May, composite precipitation in southeast South America is related to wave trains emanating from the equator.\n",

        "description": "\n\nThis article investigates the year-to-year variability of the onset of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) and the possible influences exerted by the surface temperature anomalies over land and sea. Early and late monsoon onsets are related to the temperature anomalies in different regions. It is found that an early onset follows negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central tropical Pacific (CP) Ocean during the preceding winter and spring, corresponding to a CP La Ni\u00f1a. In contrast, a late onset is preceded by the negative surface air temperature anomalies over land in the central Asian continent. Negative SST anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the associated warming in the western Pacific induce an anomalously enhanced Walker circulation. This anomalous Walker cell leads to an increase in convection, causing more latent heat release and a subsequent decrease of surface pressure. The anomalous Walker cell and the enhanced latent heat release weaken the Western North Pacific subtropical high and the Philippine Sea anticyclone, favouring a westerly flow from the Indian Ocean, resulting in an early SCSSM onset. On the other hand, negative land surface temperature anomalies cool the atmosphere over land, and locally modify the Hadley circulation, accompanied by the anomalous divergence in the low-level atmosphere over the western equatorial Pacific. This divergence anomaly reduces the latent heat release and strengthens the anticyclone in the Philippine Sea, thus preventing the westward extension of the westerlies from the Indian Ocean and causing a late SCSSM onset.\n",

However, most studies have been based on statistical approaches, which make it difficult to discover the underlying impact mechanisms. Here, using process-based crop model Model to Capture the Crop-Weather relationship over a Large Area (MCWLA)-Maize, we found a consistent spatial pattern of maize yield variability in association with ENSO between MCWLA-Maize model outputs and observations. During El Ni\u00f1o years, most areas of China, especially in the north, experience a yield increase, whereas some areas in the south have a decrease in yields. During La Ni\u00f1a years, there is an obvious decline in yields, mainly in the north and northeast, and a general increase in the south. In-depth analyses suggest that precipitation P rather than temperature T and solar radiation S during the maize growing season is the main cause of ENSO-induced maize yield variability in northern and northeastern China. Although a 2\u2009\u00b0C change of T can affect maize yields more than a 20% change of P, greater changes of P contribute more to maize yield variability during ENSO years. In general, maize yields in drier regions are much more sensitive to P variability than those in wetter areas. All changes in meteorological variables, including T, P, S, and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) during ENSO years, affect yield variability mainly through their effects on water stress. Our results suggest that more effective agricultural information can be provided to government decision makers and farmers by developing a food security warning system based on the MCWLA-Maize model and ENSO forecast information.\n",

CanCM4 is the latest component of the Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS), which is a multi-seasonal climate prediction system developed particularly for Canada but applicable globally. Generally, CanCM4's skill in reproducing the climatology during winter is not as good as in other seasons because of the model's inability to simulate the regional synoptic circulations over the western Maritime Continent. In particular, the model fails to forecast the cold surges and Borneo vortex circulations that play critical roles in moisture horizontal advection. Moreover, its forecast skill during the early winter monsoon period is poorer than during the late period. Interestingly, forecast skill is enhanced when MOS models are applied as the MOS utilizes the predictive signals in the quasi-global predictors from the CanCM4 forecast system. The predictability can be traced to the conventional El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and ENSO Modoki signals that are present in the CanCM4 forecast MOS predictor fields. The quasi-global sea-surface temperature and quasi-global sea-level pressure fields are found to be the most useful predictors. Interestingly, CanCM4 forecast signals associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole also contribute to the skill. Skill enhancement is particularly significant for northern Borneo during early monsoon periods in medium- and long-lead forecasts when the CanCM4 has minimal direct skill in the region.\n",

Three main leading modes were identified in agreement with previous works. Mode 1 activity is strongly related to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Warm anomalies in the central-eastern tropical Pacific and western Indian Ocean induce circulation anomalies extended along the South Pacific and the development of a continental-scale circulation gyre in South America promoting moisture convergence, and in turn favouring DIER positive anomalies, in eastern Argentina. The combined influence of SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic and western tropical Pacific characterizes Mode 2 activity, which induces an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation gyre in southeastern South America promoting anomalous moisture convergence (divergence) and thus positive (negative) DIER anomalies in eastern Argentina in spring and fall (summer and winter). Finally, Mode 3 activity is also influenced by SST anomalies in tropical central-eastern Pacific from winter to summer. The associated teleconnections contribute to the development of a cyclonic circulation mainly influencing southeastern South America (SESA) circulation to the north of 30\u00b0S from summer to winter, and further south in spring.\n",

Computed satellite trends resulted in very good agreement with positive values obtained from NR1 database.

The primary results are as following: (1) monthly SSI has a statistically significantly increasing trend in November and December and a noticeably decreasing trend in June and July in the main stream of the basin; (2) generally, hydrological drought risk in this basin is high, and that in the Snake River is higher than the main stream of the Columbia River; (3) El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) play a major role in affecting hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and ENSO index mainly affects SSI at a relatively short time scale (2\u20137\u2009years), while AO primarily impacts SSI at a relatively long time scale (more than 10 years); (4) anthropogenic activities intensify hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and they primarily influence the linkages between climate indices and hydrological drought at intra-annual scale (less than 12 months), however, which do not change the basic pattern of their correlations.\n",

Consistent with inviscid \u03b2-plane shallow water theory, the wave-induced convergence zones are found to be an active location for precipitation. Modulated precipitation by ER waves exhibits slow westward phase progression of approximately \u22124.8 m s\u22121, and it is distributed as a symmetric pair of off-equatorial maxima and a weak equatorial peak. MRG waves show an asymmetrically modulated precipitation distribution and a faster phase progression of about \u221216.1 m s\u22121 followed by enhanced symmetrical gyres. Peak precipitation within TD-type waves originates in the trough axis of off-equatorial vortex trains and propagates to the west at approximately \u22129.5 m s\u22121. Regarding Kelvin waves, typical positive precipitation anomalies travelling in the east\u2013west direction occur in the maxima of low-level wind convergences, with an approximate phase progression of about 15.4 m s\u22121.\nVariability of tropical precipitation due to CCEWs behaves relatively varied over different seasons and locations. TD-type waves exhibit more predominant impacts than other waves, with maximum impacts of up to 9.75 \u00b1 4.54% of the total precipitation variance during boreal summer, which is three times higher than the MRG peak (2.90 \u00b1 0.82%). On the other hand, Kelvin and n = 1 ER waves each have more prominent effects during boreal winter; up to 6.99 \u00b1 3.30 % and 3.77 \u00b1 1.79 %, respectively. On average, our results suggest that, although being less dominant than other tropical oscillations (e.g. ENSO, MJO), these four types of CCEWs can considerably affect precipitation by contributing up to 16\u201320% of the total intraseasonal (2.5\u201372 days) precipitation variance in the tropics.\n",

The results show that there was a shift from low intense TC activity during 1976/1977\u20131987/1988 (period 1) to high activity during 1988/1989\u20132007/2008 (period 2). Accumulated cyclone energy maps indicate that this shift is related to more occurrences of intense TCs in the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) and northwestern Australian region during period 2. The spatial-mode PCA identifies distinct sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) patterns dominating in periods 1 and 2. The four dominating patterns in period 1 have low or negative SSTA in the TC development regions (especially over SWIO), whereas the five dominating ones in period 2 have much higher SSTA in the same regions. The temporal variability of the vertical wind shear (VWS) over the Indian Ocean (IO) is examined through the temporal-mode PCA. The first mode is El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related, but there is no clear interdecadal variability identified. The second mode shows high VWS during the 1970s to early 1980s that is similar in length to period 1, followed by low VWS afterwards during period 2. This change in VWS thus may be responsible for the shift in intense TC activity over the IO. Linear correlative analysis shows that the mode of variability in VWS is significantly related to subtropical dipole events in the IO. Potential linkages of these findings with ENSO and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation are discussed.\n",

By doing so, the relatively new procedure known as empirical orthogonal teleconnection analysis (EOT) was validated as an effective way for identifying the impact of atmospheric patterns in remote oceanic basins on rainfall trends at a particular location. Rainfall trends were investigated, and trend analysis on optimally interpolated rain gauge data (1948\u20132013) shows no significant decrease for kiremt rainfall (June\u2013September) in North Ethiopia. However, EOT analysis of assimilated mean sea level pressure data reveals that not only El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)/La Ni\u00f1a, but also the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) has a significant impact in North Ethiopia. Including the variability of the Southwest Monsoons (SWM), subsequent multivariate regression could model North Ethiopian kiremt rainfall from these three teleconnections (R2 = 0.64), representing 89% of all dry years. In particular, the interaction between these three teleconnections was a major contributor to the 1983\u20131985 droughts and famine. The study hence finds a significant impact of three atmospheric teleconnections (ENSO, IOD, SWM) on North Ethiopian rainfall variability. Moreover, it is pointed out that EOT analysis is a useful tool to identify the relations between drought risk and remote atmospheric systems.\n",

During this period the West African Monsoon has been weaker than normal and its correlation with different climatic patterns such as the ENSO has changed. The analysis of our new series indicates that this anomalous behaviour of the West African Monsoon has no precedent in the last 170 years.\nOur results also show that the period 1839\u20131890 was characterised by a stronger than average monsoon, resulting in relatively wet conditions in the Sahel.

The SST conditions and performance of the south Asian monsoon during 2013 boreal summer months (June\u2013September) led us to hypothesize that the strong extratropical SST anomalies in the North Pacific and North Atlantic in conjunction with weak tropical SST anomalies (weak La Ni\u00f1a) were responsible for the above-normal rainfall over India during 2013. We also argue that the 2013 SST pattern and above-normal monsoon condition are not unique but occurred on several occasions in the past. Further, we show that there is a complementary pattern of strong extratropical SST and weak tropical SST that is associated with below-normal south Asian monsoon rainfall. We also show that the extratropical SST pattern in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with a low-frequency interdecadal mode of variability indicating potential predictability associated with such extratropical SST forcing. Extensive experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced by such SST conditions elucidate the mechanism through which the extratropical SSTs influence the Indian monsoon. The SST anomalies affect the north\u2013south temperature gradient and lead to a local displacement of the jet stream, setting up a quasi-stationary wave. Such a stationary wave, in turn, affects the tropospheric temperature (TT) over southern Eurasia, influencing the north\u2013south TT gradient in the region and thereby the Indian monsoon. Our discovery of this additional source of potential predictability together with the fact that the new-generation coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models are capable of predicting the extratropical SST anomalies brightens the prospect of south Asian monsoon prediction.\n",

        "description": "\nLiquid layer clouds are abundant globally. Lacking strong convection, they do not become electrified by the usual thunderstorm mechanisms of collisional electrification between hydrometeors of different phases. Instead, the background global circuit current flow in fair weather is largely unaffected by the layer cloud's presence, and, if the layer cloud is extensive horizontally, the vertical fair weather conduction current passes through the cloud. A consequence of the vertical current flow is that, at the cloud\u2013air boundary where there is a conductivity transition and droplets form or evaporate, droplet charging occurs. Charge can affect both droplet evaporation and droplet\u2013droplet collisions. Using new radiosonde instrumentation, the charge observed at layer cloud edges is evaluated for both these microphysical droplet processes. This shows that the charging is more likely to affect collision processes than activation, for small droplets. Enhancing the collection efficiency of small droplets modifies their evolution and propagates through the size distribution to shorten the autoconversion time-scale to rain drops, and the cloud radiative properties. Because the conduction current density is influenced by both external (e.g. solar modulation of high-energy particles) and internal (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation) factors, current flow leading to layer cloud edge charging provides a possible route for expressing solar influences on the climate system and a teleconnection mechanism for communicating internal climate variability.\n",

Horizontal spectral resolution is T159 (about 125 km), using 91 levels in the vertical from the surface up to 1 Pa, and a time step of 1 h. This ensemble, denoted by ERA-20CM, formed the first step toward a twentieth-century reanalysis within ERA-CLIM, a three-year European funded project involving nine partners.\nSea-surface temperature and sea-ice cover are prescribed by an ensemble of realizations (HadISST2), as recently produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre within ERA-CLIM. Variation in these realizations reflect uncertainties in the available observational sources on which this product is based. Forcing terms in the model radiation scheme follow CMIP5 recommendations. Any effect of their uncertainty is neglected. These terms include solar forcing, greenhouse gases, ozone and aerosols. Both the ocean surface and radiative forcing incorporate a proper long-term evolution of climate trends in the twentieth century, and the occurrence of major events, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillations and volcanic eruptions.\nNo atmospheric observations were assimilated. For this reason ERA-20CM is not able to reproduce actual synoptic situations. However, the ensemble is able to provide a statistical estimate of the climate. Overall, the temperature rise over land is in fair agreement with the CRUTEM4 observational product. Over the last two decades the warming over land exceeds the warming over sea, which is consistent with models participating in the CMIP5 project, as well as with the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Some aspects of warming and of the hydrological cycle are discerned, and the model response to volcanic eruptions is qualitatively correct.\nThe data from ERA-20CM are freely available, embracing monthly-mean fields for many atmospheric and ocean-wave quantities, and synoptic fields for a small, essential subset.\n",

        "description": "The variability and predictability of tropical storm activity in the Met Office fully coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean Global Seasonal Forecast System 5 (GloSea5) is assessed. GloSea5 is a high-resolution seasonal forecast system with an atmospheric horizontal grid of 0.83\u00b0\nlongitude \u00d7 0.55\u00b0 latitude (\u223c53\u2009km at 55\u00b0N) and 0.25\u00b0 in the global ocean. The performance of the system is assessed in terms of its ability to retrospectively predict the observed tropical storm climatology and its response to the El\u00a0Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results are compared to the predecessor system GloSea4 (\u223c120\u2009km atmospheric horizontal resolution) and observational analyses over the common period of the operational hindcast for both systems: 1996\u20132009. A supplementary assessment of GloSea5 for the period 1992\u20132013 is then performed to evaluate skill of tropical storm predictions in the Northern Hemisphere as well as landfall frequency along two regions, the US coast and the Caribbean, over a longer period. GloSea5 is able to reproduce key tropical storm characteristics, such as their geographical distribution, seasonal cycle and interannual variability, as well as spatial changes in storm track density with ENSO. GloSea5 shows statistically significant skill for predictions of tropical storm numbers and accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index in the North Atlantic, western Pacific, Australian region and South Pacific. Statistically significant skill is also found for predictions of landfall frequency along the Caribbean coastline. Skill is similar using either the direct counting of landfalling storms in the model, or by inferring landfall rates from the Atlantic basin-wide storm count. We find no skill for predictions of landfall along the US coast. Results suggest the potential for operational seasonal tropical storm forecasts throughout the Tropics.\n",

The cruise was conducted in three different hydrological\nareas identified as the Kuroshio region, the subtropical gyre area and the\ntransition zone. Two eddies were crossed along the transect: one cold-core\ncyclonic eddy and one warm-core anticyclonic eddy and distributions of the\nheterotrophic prokaryotes were recorded. By using analytical flow cytometry\nand a nucleic acid staining protocol, heterotrophic prokaryotes were\ndiscriminated into three subgroups depending on their nucleic acid content\n(low, high and very high nucleic acid contents labelled LNA, HNA and VHNA,\nrespectively). Statistical analyses performed on the data set showed that\nLNA, mainly associated with low temperature and low salinity, were dominant\nin all the hydrological regions. In contrast, HNA distribution seemed to be\nassociated with temperature, salinity, Chl <i>a</i> and silicic acid. A latitudinal\nincrease in the HNA / LNA ratio was observed along the north\u2013south transect\nand was related to higher phosphate and nitrate concentrations. However, the\nopposite relationship observed for the VHNA / HNA ratio suggested that the\nlink between nucleic acid content and oligotrophic conditions is not linear,\nunderlying the complexity of the biodiversity in the VHNA, HNA and LNA\nsubgroups. In the Kuroshio Current, it is suggested that the high\nconcentration of heterotrophic prokaryotes observed at station 4 was linked\nto the path of the cold cyclonic eddy core. In contrast, it is thought that\nlow concentrations of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the warm core of the\nanticyclonic gyre (Sta. 9) are related to the low nutrient concentrations\nmeasured in the seawater column. Our results showed that the high\nvariability between the various heterotrophic prokaryote cluster abundances\ndepend both on the mesoscale structures and the oligotrophic gradient.",

Snowfall rates at Law Dome, East Antarctica, have been linked with\nregional atmospheric circulation to the mid-latitudes as well as regional\nAntarctic snowfall. Here, we extend the length of the Law Dome accumulation record from 750\nyears to 2035 years, using recent annual layer dating that extends to 22 BCE. Accumulation rates were calculated as the ratio of measured to modelled\nlayer thicknesses, multiplied by the long-term mean accumulation rate. The\nmodelled layer thicknesses were based on a power-law vertical strain rate\nprofile fitted to observed annual layer thickness. The periods 380\u2013442,\n727\u2013783  and 1970\u20132009 CE have above-average snow accumulation rates,\nwhile 663\u2013704, 933\u2013975 and 1429\u20131468 CE were below average, and\ndecadal-scale snow accumulation anomalies were found to be relatively common\n(74 events in the 2035-year record). The calculated snow accumulation rates\nshow good correlation with atmospheric reanalysis estimates, and significant\nspatial correlation over a wide expanse of East Antarctica, demonstrating\nthat the Law Dome record captures larger-scale variability across a large\nregion of East Antarctica well beyond the immediate vicinity of the Law Dome\nsummit.

Brierley<br /><br />Following reconstructions suggesting weakened temperature gradients along the\nEquator in the early Pliocene, there has been much speculation about Pliocene\nclimate variability. A major advance for our knowledge about the later\nPliocene has been the coordination of modelling efforts through the Pliocene\nModel Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP). Here the changes in interannual\nmodes of sea surface temperature variability will be presented across\nPlioMIP. Previously, model ensembles have shown little consensus in the\nresponse of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to imposed forcings\n\u2013 either for the past or future. The PlioMIP ensemble, however, shows\nsurprising agreement, with eight models simulating reduced variability and\nonly one model indicating no change. The Pliocene's robustly weaker ENSO also\nsaw a shift to lower frequencies. Model ensembles focussed on a wide variety\nof forcing scenarios have not yet shown this level of coherency. Nonetheless,\nthe PlioMIP ensemble does not show a robust response of either ENSO flavour\nor sea surface temperature variability in the tropical Indian and North\nPacific oceans. Existing suggestions linking ENSO properties to to changes in\nzonal temperature gradient, seasonal cycle and the elevation of the Andes\nMountains are investigated, yet prove insufficient to explain the consistent\nresponse.
